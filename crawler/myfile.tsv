Football365 - Football News, Views, Gossip and much more...	We cannot imagine this will go down incredibly well with Wayne Rooney but it looks like he will be on the left tonight against Ecuador. "He can do that (role), absolutely," said Hodgson, who also confirmed that Frank Lampard would captain the side and James Milner would start at right-back. "I think Wayne's a very useful player in the sense you don't have to pin him down and say this is the only position he can play." The debate continues...	sports

The Afternoon Gossip | Football Transfer Rumours and Gossip | Football365	Barca plan £56m move for Aguero, City close to securing £15m Fernando, Arsenal target Morata to join Juve, and... Last Updated: 03/06/14 at 16:32 Post Comment Latest Articles Chelsea in pole position for Fabregas, Spurs target three defensive recruits, Bony to cost Arsenal £19m and more... Adam Lallana needs to put in a transfer request to force through Reds move, Balotelli to Arsenal and Cesc to City... All the rumours from Tuesday morning are here... BARCELONA PLOT AGUERO BID It looks like Barcelona won't take 'no' for an answer in their chase for Sergio Aguero. According to the Daily Star, the Catalan club are preparing a bid of £56m for the striker, who is also attracting interest from Real Madrid. Aguero's father told COPE radio that his son prefers a move to Barcelona last week, but added that Manchester City are unlikely to let him leave. The Star report: 'New Barcelona manager Luis Enrique has made the 26-year-old his No.1 summer target. 'Cesc Fabregas and Alexis Sanchez are set to leave Barcelona during the close season and Enrique wants to use the funds raised through their sales to finance a deal for Aguero.' FERNANDO SET FOR CITY Manchester City are close to sealing a £15m move for Porto midfielder Fernando, report the Daily Mirror. The 26-year-old was tipped for a deadline-day switch to the Etihad in February, but the transfer fell through at the eleventh hour. A deal for Fernando has now been resurrected, though, with City also chasing his teammate Eliaquim Mangala. MORATA WANTS JUVE MOVE After months of speculation linking Alvaro Morata with a move to Arsenal, it seems the Real Madrid forward is now on his way to Juventus. The Daily Express claim that Real are planning to use the 21-year-old as bait in their bid to bring Arturo Vidal to the Santiago Bernabeu. Apparently Carlo Ancelotti sees Vidal as the perfect replacement for the ageing Xabi Alonso, and is willing to let Morata go to secure a transfer. STOKE CLOSING ON DIOUF Stoke are closing in on their second signing of the summer after already completing a deal for Sunderland's Phil Bardsley. The next target on Mark Hughes' wish list is former Manchester United striker Mame Biram Diouf, who was close to joining the Potters last summer. Diouf has caught Hughes' eye after scoring 33 goals in 68 games for Hannover over the past two seasons and it's thought a transfer is close to completion. "We're hopeful that Diouf will be done," Stoke chairman Peter Coates told the BBC. AND THE REST Roberto Martinez has revealed that he has already identified who he wants to sign this summer, and is now working on closing several deals...Arsenal face competition for Toulouse right-back Serge Aurier after his agent said the Ivorian is currently in talks with another English club...Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United are all tracking highly-rated MK Dons youngster Dele Alli...Aleksandar Kolarov has emerged as a target for Bayern Munich...Michael Laudrup is planning to return to management with a 'big club'...and finally, there is a tremendous piece of bulls**t doing the rounds that Manchester United want Luis Suarez for £65m. Inventive.	sports

We have lots of World Cup mails so thanks... There are only ten days to go before the biggest event of the football calendar and yet we're still having to publish emails about Arsene Wenger.

Despite cruising to a 3-0 win against Peru, England didn't show a great deal to support Matt Stanger's view that they'll get out of the group. He's waiting to judge Wayne Rooney... It's unlikley Peru will provide a similar test to Uruguay simply because they are from the same confederation, but the most important thing for England is to avoid costly injuries...

Ashley Cole showing a genuine emotion, Kallstrom's last match and Newcastle fans actually wanting their club to be run in an ethical manner. These are heady times indeed... It was a performance that encapsulated everything that Mourinho stands for and desires. On a sunny morning in Liverpool, Jose came, he saw and he ruined the party... It's easy to criticise Mike Dean for another catalogue of errors, but he should really be congratulated for such an impressive display of winding-up Rui Faria and Chelsea. Liverpool got the 'fear' at times on Sunday, but Vincent Kompany was there to allow the little kid to carry on sprinting. The sort of mistake that wins or loses a title race...	sports

The Page That Is Planning More Treats | Football365 | Mediawatch	Latest Articles 'Man reminds other men to sing (even though there's no indication they've forgotten)' is the headline on several back pages while Daniel Sturridge has been 'forcing' Roy Hodgson to play him... Which journo has claimed an exclusive on the Lambert story despite citing The Guardian elsewhere? And Robbie Savage thinks that Tim Sherwood is more magic than Harry Potter... Wrong, Wrong, Wrong Ian Wright has launced a staunch defence of Danny Welbeck in The Sun as he struggles to grasp why some fans don't want to see the forward in England's first XI. 'People are constantly having a pop at him but there's not a lot of foundation to that beyond the fact United had such a nightmare season,' writes Wright. 'Of course, he might miss a couple of chances here and there...' A couple of chances, Ian? Only 13 goals in 77 appearances for United over the last two seasons suggests he's missed a lot more than that. Of course, there's still a strong case for Welbeck to start for England, but what irks Mediawatch is Wright's refusal to acknowledge the debate is justified while simultaneously participating in said debate. 'In many ways it's just like bullying,' continues Wright on the 'head-scratching' opposition to Welbeck's inclusion. 'There's just no substance to it beyond the fact he plays for United - nothing more than that.' However, Wrighty then concedes: 'I can see why people want to see Sterling in there...' So which is it, Ian? An illogical view based purely on club tribalism, or just standard pre-World Cup discussion, which you're clearly happy to entertain despite insisting there is no debate to be had? Big Draw 'We are an Ecuadraw' boasts the headline in The Sun as they preview Wednesday's warm-up game. Writes Charlie Wyett: 'England are set to play in front of a 20,000-plus crowd against Ecuador in Miami tomorrow. 'An official at Sun Life Stadium - home to the Miami Dolphins - said: "We were hoping for up to 30,000. But it's not bad as the game will be played in working hours." 'The ageing stadium can hold up to 76,000 but large sections will be sealed off. Tickets start at £20.' So apart from anticipating an extra 10,000 fans, and having to seal off some 50,000 seats despite reasonable prices, it certainly looks like England are a big (Ecua)draw. Durham As seems to be the trend on Tuesday, Adrian Durham sticks up for his England favourite on the MailOnline, insisting that Wayne Rooney is still the best player available to Roy Hodgson. His entire premise is detailed in four bullet points at the top of the page - which the Mail now attach to every article for those who can't be bothered to read - but Mediawatch still scrolled to the very bottom so you don't have to. 'When I read Mick Channon describing Rooney as the 'weak link' on Sportsmail last week I was shocked,' writes Durham. 'The former Manchester City and Southampton striker is right that Rooney hasn't delivered at a World Cup, but he's only the weak link if he offers less than the rest. 'Rooney doesn't deserve the criticism. He has earned the right with performances and goals for his club and country for us all to debate how to get the best out of him, rather than lazily writing him off.' How very noble. You can say what you like about Adrian Durham - and Mediawatch has said it all - but if there's one thing you'll never catch him doing it's lazily writing someone off. He'd never...oh, what's that? From July 2013: 'You're Carlo Ancelotti. You're deciding who would be the better signing - Wayne Rooney or Luis Suarez. It's a no-brainer. Rooney is miles ahead. 'In fact I wonder how good Luis Suarez actually is. He's got quality and ability - probably more than most. But looking good in the Dutch league and standing out in one of the most average Liverpool sides I've seen in my lifetime does not constitute a top-level player.' Ah, just when we thought we could be friends. Friends Headline on the MailOnline (we'll let you guess who penned the article): 'Chelsea would have won more friends if model pro Frank Lampard had been captain rather than tarnished John Terry.' Yes, because that's what competitive sport is about. And Finally... 'How dare Southampton hold Adam Lallana back?' Oh God, no more Durham. Ever. Please. Like Rain On Your Wedding Day Writes Dave Kidd in the Daily Mirror: 'There's a certain irony in the fact that Spurs have told Mauricio Pochettino he must speak English in press conferences, having sacked Tim Sherwood for speaking too much plain English in press conferences.' Two things: 1) Tim Sherwood wasn't sacked for 'speaking too much plain English'. He was sacked owing to a dreadful record against Spurs' top-four rivals and because he was accused of having lost the players' confidence. 2) That isn't ironic. Exclusively Bulls**t '16 CLUBS CHASE FRANK', booms the 'WORLD EXCLUSIVE' on the back page of The Sun, with scribe Andrew Dillon writing: 'Frank Lampard is the world's most wanted player with 16 clubs chasing him.' Wow, 16 clubs. We'd love to know who they are, and surely The Sun are prepared to divulge that information given that it's a 'WORLD EXCLUSIVE'. Otherwise, isn't this just another story saying Lampard has options? 'Italians Fiorentina and clubs in Qatar and Brazil have added their names to the long list of teams who want to land him,' Dillon continues. 'LA Galaxy have re-emerged as contenders as well, along with the MLS' newest franchise New York City. 'And, as SunSport exclusively revealed last week, Lamps' uncle, QPR boss Harry Redknapp, is desperate to lure the Blues legend after winning promotion to the top flight.' Mediawatch makes that four clubs The Sun have named in their 'WORLD EXCLUSIVE'. There must be an awful lot of teams in Qatar and Brazil. West West End Report the Daily Mirror: 'Spurs midfielder Paulinho has reacted to Chelsea dropping their interest in him by insisting he never wanted to quit White Hart Lane. 'The Brazilian World Cup star, who made it clear he wanted out of the club after a spell on the bench under Tim Sherwood, said: "I never considered returning to Brazil. It never crossed my mind."' He knows Chelsea are based just down the road, right? One To Keep Your Eye On 'Sergio Aguero is going nowhere this summer - after Manchester City ruled out a sale' - The Sun. 'Manchester City will not sell Sergio Aguero - even for a world-record fee' - the Daily Mirror. Mediawatch couldn't be more certain that's the last we'll hear of Aguero's links to Real Madrid... Joyful Father-To-Be Of The Day Said Philippe Senderos on the birth of his child: "I can only pray that the baby arrives once I am home from Brazil." Good to know he's got his priorities straight.

The 26-year-old phone user was text messaging his partner for a number of hours while in bed. 'But his excessive messaging led to him suffering from sudden flashes in his eyesight.

A Sterling Stick To Use On Hodgson... | F365 Says	It's very, very easy to write a column saying that the latest Bright Young Thing should start for England...but thankfully England have a manager and not an X Factor-style vote... Last Updated: 03/06/14 at 16:00 Post Comment Latest Articles ...that makes Rickie Lambert a good fit at Liverpool, says Adam Bate. He clearly does offer a Plan B but he's good enough to fit in with the Plan A too. It's sound... Roy Hodgson is saddened by England's obsession with Wayne Rooney, but what does he expect? The debate over the striker's inclusion is now more relevant than ever... In March, the Daily Mail's Martin Samuel - never a man shy to state his case against all manner of straw men and 'mistakes' yet to be made - decried the lack of wingers in the England World Cup squad that would not be named for another two months. He screamed for more 'crackerjack wide players', for Raheem Sterling, Andros Townsend, Adam Lallana, Adam Johnson and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to be on the plane to Brazil. 'One minute we bemoan the lack of talent, the next we haven't got room for it all. Make your minds up, gentlemen,' he wrote. We're unsure which anonymous 'gentlemen' he was addressing but presumably he's fuming that Johnson - rather good for five minutes at the turn of the year - was left behind. He should be pleased that Sterling, Lallana and Oxlade-Chamberlain did make the final 23-man squad but instead he's angry again... 'Raheem Sterling needs to start, Roy...England have a long-standing mistrust of talent that needs to end in Brazil,' was the headline on Monday's column, which fumes at the fact that the useful but uninspiring James Milner was brought on ahead of Sterling against Peru on Friday night. That will be Milner (45 caps) brought on ahead of Sterling (two caps) - a point Samuel uses to illustrate England's innate distrust of fancy players, via a whistlestop tour of Matt Le Tissier, Alan Hudson, Rodney Marsh, Stan Bowles, Tony Currie and Peter Osgood. What Samuel - and anyone else clamouring for the very talented but ultimately inexperienced Sterling to leapfrog Milner and Danny Welbeck - fails to recognise is that the Liverpool winger is just 19 and has already been fast-tracked into the senior set-up. Milner and Welbeck were not England internationals at 19; the fact that Sterling is there at all is an acknowledgement that he has a talent that far outweighs his rivals. The question is not whether he will become a better player than either of those hard-working but limited players, but whether he is a better option right now in what would easily be the biggest game of his career against Italy in Manaus. It's incredibly easy to shout for the inclusion of an in-form player - especially when he plays for a club with a large and vociferous fanbase - and it's even easier when the alternatives appear to be so stodgy. There aren't many putting their hands up and pointing out that Welbeck had an incredibly similar strike rate to Sterling this season (nine goals from 45/46 shots) and was excellent against Bayern Munich in the Champions League, while Milner probably has even fewer people in his corner despite two Premier League titles in the last three seasons. Having been robbed of one 'conservative' beating stick by Hodgson's brave and balanced squad selection (conservative would have been to include Ashley Cole, Michael Carrick and Jermain Defoe), the next stick in hand is his reluctance to play the season's in-form XI, with no regard to performances in training, mental aptitude, experience or specific gameplans for specific opponents. Sod all that stuff, just play the kid who looks exciting - it's the easiest column to write as we approach a major tournament. Sterling will start against Ecuador on Wednesday, could well be ruddy marvellous, but still find himself on the bench against Honduras on Saturday and Italy a week later. Hands will be thrown up in the hair and we will wonder whether the same hands were thrown in the air 16 years ago when the precociously talented 18-year-old Michael Owen was left out of the starting line-up as England began their World Cup campaign in France. Two games and two lively substitute appearances later, Owen - now acclimatised to tournament football - came into the England side, along with the similarly untested David Beckham. The England manager that year was Glenn Hoddle, now regularly wheeled out as one of the great sages of the game and a potential saviour of English football. He saved Owen until he was sure he was ready, initially using his pace as an 'option off the bench', a phrase decried by Samuel this week. Hodgson may well decide to start Sterling against Italy - after all, he threw in the similarly youthful Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain two years ago - but should he choose the diligent Welbeck instead, it will be a decision based on rather more than 'who is the better player?' It's why we have a manager and don't choose the England team by public vote. Sarah Winterburn	sports

Amongst the many flaws of his system is the fact that I can't imagine any sane minded Real Madrid fan (for example) getting too excited if Aaron Lennon or Kyle Walker were linked to their club can you? Rob Pearse Cesc Never Won Owt In response to Conor (Honestly, I'm not carrying emotional baggage), Gooner, Dublin. First of all, I totally understand the romance of bringing Cesc back. I even think we could make room for him because, after all, he is a fantastic player. My issue is with the idea that bringing him back would represent the return of some kind of talisman who bought us through so many "bad times". The idea that bringing him back would somehow return us to our former glory. I'd just like to respectfully point out that we won absolutely nothing in the period that Cesc was our captain. It would be nice to heap some praise on those players who have put in the sort of performances that did finally break the drought. Mertesacker, Koscielny, Ramsey, Giroud - all players who came through bad times and now actually have something to show for it. Nothing wrong with a bit of romance but let's have it right, as good as Cesc was, we never saw him lift a trophy. Ben Smith - North Bank. Silly To Swap Ozil I would love nothing more than to have Cesc back in the side. Watching that goal against Tottenham again today reminded me of so many good times when he was at the club. However, swapping Ozil for Fabregas would be silly. Top of our assist charts, one of the biggest summer signings globally, our catalyst for last season and a trophy. Selling him and bringing in Cesc will look (not necessarily be) a step backwards ... So what are the other options? Adding without selling would mean we would be overloaded in midfield. Cazorla? Love him to bits and would hate to see him leave but he is 29 now and Cesc certainly wouldn't be a downgrade. Arteta? Not really a like for like replacement but I felt Arteta has been on the decline this season.. Still sometimes you do need someone to slow the pace of the game down Wilshire? Tricky one this. If Wilshire can get over his injuries he could be world class but he has been out-shined by Ramsey and will surely get less play time next season as a result...However, you do need a certain amount of English players in the Champs squad. And he is very good Ramsey? No I think ultimately no matter how much we love Cesc, I don't think there is a space for him in the squad anymore (i would argue that the only choice would be for Cazorla). It would hurt to see him play for a different english club but I would hope that he would "be injured" whenever he played us Rob (To be honest, I don't think Ozil looked like he enjoyed playing at Real that much either) AFC Anthems To Jae, Tunbridge Wells, who had a pop at "God Save the Queen," just be thankful that you're not from the USA. We've got an anthem that is virtually unsingable (and the tune was written by a man named John Smith, for crying out loud), and whose words are so convoluted that maybe 1 out of 10 Americans can tell you what they actually mean. Almost nobody likes it. I'd be very happy with "God Save the Queen," and in fact we already have it here, only with different words and titled "My Country 'Tis of Thee." But we stick with "The Star Spangled Banner," because...well, because. But what I'd really like is "Il Canto Degli Italiani," the Italian national anthem, an unabashed piece of militarism that's just flat-out fun, in a way that only the Italians can manage. PeterG, Pennsylavnia, USA Zing To add to the Non-English and where we stand on supporting England..... I am from Cardiff, the Capital City of Wales. Support nobody but Cardiff City and Wales but have lived and worked in London for about 5 years. I have just drawn England in my work sweepstake. .............however I do get £16 as a losing finalist! Rob Addressing A Few Points Conor, Dublin Gooner. Apart from not being sure how Man U are Arsenal's "ex best-mate" and how Chelsea are their "younger, richer, more successful neighbour", I didn't think we were allowed to do those "It's like when you're going out with/not going out with/meeting up with when too drunk to realise it's a stupid idea" analogies any more. I mean, it just isn't like that. It's like when a bloke who used to play for your football team went and played for another one. It most assuredly is nothing like having a real girlfriend who then, ah...I see. Moving on. Frank Lampard's "obscene goal output" is largely due to him taking about 150 penalties (guessed) over his career at Chelsea. Given just this, my goal output would be at least "creditable". I'm with you Chris MUFC. I'd have preferred it if we hadn't appealed Rooney's quite-deserved 3 game ban and not taken him to the last tournament. I thought we were doing better without him. Of course, we'll never know but I think we might well be better off now if he were just another 9 as opposed to the supposedly essential and yet clearly detrimental axis around which everything else must be shoe-horned into orbit. In which case, Tom London, I heartily disagree. He's not our "best player" (subjective yet stated as fact). He's been the "essential axis around which everything else must be shoe-horned into orbit" for ten years and considering his position, he bloody well should be our highest goal-scorer and would still be even if he was one of those players who just did their job in a formation (clue, scored goals) rather than being all of that, the second-coming and Gazza on a cracker at the same time. I would rather see this than people (Wazza included) shunted out of position to accommodate him because I'm one of those sane men, women or children who don't believe we'd win the thing with 11 of him. Nobody thinks Welbeck is a better option. Inventing a ridiculous argument that nobody is having to juxtapose your idea doesn't reflect as well upon it as you think. Jae, Tunbridge Wells (disgusted of?) I stopped at the Spanish not needing a good sing-along. Presumably you know that their anthem doesn't have any words (officially) and that quite obviously this is not the most important difference between the lavishly gifted Spain squad and that of the rather more workmanlike stylings of England. Beyond that, I couldn't really what sort of sensible point you might be about to make. Then the asterisks caught my eye and I might have done you a disservice. The bit in between was obviously bollocks but yes, this should be our new national anthem. Ed, Weymouth. Do it mate. I've been to south Dorset. It deserves it. Besides, I like Fearne. Rather more thanks to your capitalised MIDDLE-NAMING of her. Cheers, Jim (I know, not much constructive to offer) Essex Best World Cups Jim, Bali (Coming for your job, Degsy) is right. Get your money on Argentina. I've done a predictor as well and also have them beating Brazil in the final, although I have England going out to Columbia in the 2nd round (due to the stifling heat, Rooney playing like a hod carrier, and Glenn Johnson playing). Regarding favourite past tournaments, Argentina '78 was great partly due to the ticker tape and dark flowing locks of Mario Kempes, but 1982 in Spain comes out tops for me. The atmosphere was intense, and Brazil were unbelievable to watch (all you tiki-taka fans would do well to spend time having a shufty at that team to realise what exciting football really is). I could rhyme off a list of their footballing gods such as Socrates, Falcao, Junior, Zico, plus plenty of their goals which could've been sold off as works of art, and this would easily make my point, but the player who will always stick in my memory was Eder, who made the spectacular seem the norm. Volleys, chips, thunderb*st*rds were almost to be expected when he played. My favourite Eder moment was actually one that he missed, against Argentina, where he takes a lengthy run up not unlike cricketer Michael Holding would have done in his pomp (I can't find the Motson commentary but he chirped something like "And Eder is lining up what looks like a tremendous shot"), meets the ball with the outside of his foot and fires a curving, dipping piledriver which crashes against the bar, leaving Zico an easy tap in. Witness: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCFL1UEJ47M. Mesmerising. Their lack of concentration on defence meant they went out to eventual winners Italy, and a Paulo Rossi hat-trick, in the semis, but at least the Italy/Germany final provided this! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XOL8o-3TZ8. I rest my case. Steve Smith (LFC) Top XIs Re. Bernard (France 98 is still my fave) MUFC Here's my stab at your one country represented world cup XI (plus the full complement 12 on the bench because I like a challenge): GK: Thibaut Courtois - Belgium RB: Pablo Zabaleta - Argentina LB: Philipp Lahm - Germany CB: Sergio Ramos - Spain CB: Raphaël Varane - France DM: Daniele De Rossi - Italy CM: Yaya Touré - Ivory Coast CM: Fernandinho - Brazil RW: Alexis Sánchez - Chile LW: Cristiano Ronaldo - Portugal FW: Luis Suarez - Uruguay Subs: Joe Hart (England), Joël Matip (Cameroon), Stephan Lichtsteiner (Switazerland), Nigel De Jong (Netherlands), Mile Jedinak (Australia), Luka Modrić (Croatia), Fredy Guarín (Colombia), Shinji Kagawa (Japan), Miralem Pjanić (BiH), Javier Hernández (Mexico), Kevin-Prince Boateng (Ghana) , Igor Akinfeev (Russia) Blue Tim (France '98 is also my fav; watched it in a bowling alley in Boulogne on a school trip) ...Bernard (France 98 is still my fave) MUFC's letter is one of those classic World Cup warm-up games. Although, when he said his one Brazilian was a defender I was definitely expecting their best defender. Dante ahead of Silva?! An attempt (4-3-3): Akinfeev (Russia); Abate (Italy), Tiago Silva (Brazil), Kompany (Belgium), Lahm (Germany); Iniesta (Spain), Vidal (Chile), Pogba (France); Suarez (Uruguay), Messi (Argentina), Ronaldo (Portugal). Ok, Akinfeev is very good but probably not a world beater. In front of him though are a back 4 with so much ability I think he'd be safe enough. Joe Hart instead maybe? A midfield with a mix of power, dynamism and brains. And those 3 up front. Might not pass to each other a lot, but shouldn't need to. Paraic (Who should I support?), Ireland	sports

However, swapping Ozil for Fabregas would be silly. Top of our assist charts, one of the biggest summer signings globally, our catalyst for last season and a trophy. Selling him and bringing in Cesc will look (not necessarily be) a step backwards ... So what are the other options? Adding without selling would mean we would be overloaded in midfield. Cazorla? Love him to bits and would hate to see him leave but he is 29 now and Cesc certainly wouldn't be a downgrade. Arteta? Not really a like for like replacement but I felt Arteta has been on the decline this season.. Still sometimes you do need someone to slow the pace of the game down Wilshire? Tricky one this. If Wilshire can get over his injuries he could be world class but he has been out-shined by Ramsey and will surely get less play time next season as a result...However, you do need a certain amount of English players in the Champs squad. And he is very good Ramsey? No I think ultimately no matter how much we love Cesc, I don't think there is a space for him in the squad anymore (i would argue that the only choice would be for Cazorla). It would hurt to see him play for a different english club but I would hope that he would "be injured" whenever he played us Rob (To be honest, I don't think Ozil looked like he enjoyed playing at Real that much either) AFC Anthems To Jae, Tunbridge Wells, who had a pop at "God Save the Queen," just be thankful that you're not from the USA. We've got an anthem that is virtually unsingable (and the tune was written by a man named John Smith, for crying out loud), and whose words are so convoluted that maybe 1 out of 10 Americans can tell you what they actually mean. Almost nobody likes it. I'd be very happy with "God Save the Queen," and in fact we already have it here, only with different words and titled "My Country 'Tis of Thee." But we stick with "The Star Spangled Banner," because...well, because. But what I'd really like is "Il Canto Degli Italiani," the Italian national anthem, an unabashed piece of militarism that's just flat-out fun, in a way that only the Italians can manage. PeterG, Pennsylavnia, USA Zing To add to the Non-English and where we stand on supporting England..... I am from Cardiff, the Capital City of Wales. Support nobody but Cardiff City and Wales but have lived and worked in London for about 5 years. I have just drawn England in my work sweepstake. .............however I do get £16 as a losing finalist! Rob Addressing A Few Points Conor, Dublin Gooner. Apart from not being sure how Man U are Arsenal's "ex best-mate" and how Chelsea are their "younger, richer, more successful neighbour", I didn't think we were allowed to do those "It's like when you're going out with/not going out with/meeting up with when too drunk to realise it's a stupid idea" analogies any more. I mean, it just isn't like that. It's like when a bloke who used to play for your football team went and played for another one. It most assuredly is nothing like having a real girlfriend who then, ah...I see. Moving on. Frank Lampard's "obscene goal output" is largely due to him taking about 150 penalties (guessed) over his career at Chelsea. Given just this, my goal output would be at least "creditable". I'm with you Chris MUFC. I'd have preferred it if we hadn't appealed Rooney's quite-deserved 3 game ban and not taken him to the last tournament. I thought we were doing better without him. Of course, we'll never know but I think we might well be better off now if he were just another 9 as opposed to the supposedly essential and yet clearly detrimental axis around which everything else must be shoe-horned into orbit. In which case, Tom London, I heartily disagree. He's not our "best player" (subjective yet stated as fact). He's been the "essential axis around which everything else must be shoe-horned into orbit" for ten years and considering his position, he bloody well should be our highest goal-scorer and would still be even if he was one of those players who just did their job in a formation (clue, scored goals) rather than being all of that, the second-coming and Gazza on a cracker at the same time. I would rather see this than people (Wazza included) shunted out of position to accommodate him because I'm one of those sane men, women or children who don't believe we'd win the thing with 11 of him. Nobody thinks Welbeck is a better option. Inventing a ridiculous argument that nobody is having to juxtapose your idea doesn't reflect as well upon it as you think. Jae, Tunbridge Wells (disgusted of?) I stopped at the Spanish not needing a good sing-along. Presumably you know that their anthem doesn't have any words (officially) and that quite obviously this is not the most important difference between the lavishly gifted Spain squad and that of the rather more workmanlike stylings of England. Beyond that, I couldn't really what sort of sensible point you might be about to make. Then the asterisks caught my eye and I might have done you a disservice. The bit in between was obviously bollocks but yes, this should be our new national anthem. Ed, Weymouth. Do it mate. I've been to south Dorset. It deserves it. Besides, I like Fearne. Rather more thanks to your capitalised MIDDLE-NAMING of her. Cheers, Jim (I know, not much constructive to offer) Essex Best World Cups Jim, Bali (Coming for your job, Degsy) is right. Get your money on Argentina. I've done a predictor as well and also have them beating Brazil in the final, although I have England going out to Columbia in the 2nd round (due to the stifling heat, Rooney playing like a hod carrier, and Glenn Johnson playing). Regarding favourite past tournaments, Argentina '78 was great partly due to the ticker tape and dark flowing locks of Mario Kempes, but 1982 in Spain comes out tops for me. The atmosphere was intense, and Brazil were unbelievable to watch (all you tiki-taka fans would do well to spend time having a shufty at that team to realise what exciting football really is). I could rhyme off a list of their footballing gods such as Socrates, Falcao, Junior, Zico, plus plenty of their goals which could've been sold off as works of art, and this would easily make my point, but the player who will always stick in my memory was Eder, who made the spectacular seem the norm. Volleys, chips, thunderb*st*rds were almost to be expected when he played. My favourite Eder moment was actually one that he missed, against Argentina, where he takes a lengthy run up not unlike cricketer Michael Holding would have done in his pomp (I can't find the Motson commentary but he chirped something like "And Eder is lining up what looks like a tremendous shot"), meets the ball with the outside of his foot and fires a curving, dipping piledriver which crashes against the bar, leaving Zico an easy tap in. Witness: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCFL1UEJ47M. Mesmerising. Their lack of concentration on defence meant they went out to eventual winners Italy, and a Paulo Rossi hat-trick, in the semis, but at least the Italy/Germany final provided this! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XOL8o-3TZ8. I rest my case. Steve Smith (LFC) Top XIs Re. Bernard (France 98 is still my fave) MUFC Here's my stab at your one country represented world cup XI (plus the full complement 12 on the bench because I like a challenge): GK: Thibaut Courtois - Belgium RB: Pablo Zabaleta - Argentina LB: Philipp Lahm - Germany CB: Sergio Ramos - Spain CB: Raphaël Varane - France DM: Daniele De Rossi - Italy CM: Yaya Touré - Ivory Coast CM: Fernandinho - Brazil RW: Alexis Sánchez - Chile LW: Cristiano Ronaldo - Portugal FW: Luis Suarez - Uruguay Subs: Joe Hart (England), Joël Matip (Cameroon), Stephan Lichtsteiner (Switazerland), Nigel De Jong (Netherlands), Mile Jedinak (Australia), Luka Modrić (Croatia), Fredy Guarín (Colombia), Shinji Kagawa (Japan), Miralem Pjanić (BiH), Javier Hernández (Mexico), Kevin-Prince Boateng (Ghana) , Igor Akinfeev (Russia) Blue Tim (France '98 is also my fav; watched it in a bowling alley in Boulogne on a school trip) ...Bernard (France 98 is still my fave) MUFC's letter is one of those classic World Cup warm-up games. Although, when he said his one Brazilian was a defender I was definitely expecting their best defender. Dante ahead of Silva?! An attempt (4-3-3): Akinfeev (Russia); Abate (Italy), Tiago Silva (Brazil), Kompany (Belgium), Lahm (Germany); Iniesta (Spain), Vidal (Chile), Pogba (France); Suarez (Uruguay), Messi (Argentina), Ronaldo (Portugal). Ok, Akinfeev is very good but probably not a world beater. In front of him though are a back 4 with so much ability I think he'd be safe enough. Joe Hart instead maybe? A midfield with a mix of power, dynamism and brains. And those 3 up front. Might not pass to each other a lot, but shouldn't need to. Paraic (Who should I support?), Ireland	sports

World Cup Group Analysis: Group G - Goal.com	Goal analyzes all the eight groups in this year's world cup. Continuing with our series, we take a look at Group G... SPECIAL By Shikharr Chandra GERMANY Profile Titles: FIFA World Cup (1954, 1974, 1990), Confederations Cup (1999), European Championship (1972, 1980, 1996)  Top Scorer: Miroslav Klose (68) Most Apearances: Lothar Matthaus (150) FIFA Ranking: 2 Star Man: Mario Gotze Appearances: 28 Goals: 7 Formation 4-2-3-1   Coach Part of the German camp for over 10 years now, Joachim Low comes across as one of the most offensive coaches in this summer's tournament. Low, who has led the Germans in the last two European Championships and the 2010 World Cup, which saw his side succumb to pressure during the final few games of each of those tournaments. Low's philosophy is based on quick passing and keeping possession. What would be interesting to note is whether he will play with a false 9 or go with a more direct approach with a center forward in the side. How they set up Die Adler will look to setup in their usual 4-2-3-1 formation with the main aim being to keep the ball and not allow the oppositions to take control of the game. Low, whose German sides were based on quick counter attacks four years ago have completely changed their setup and ball retention now remains the key aspect of their game. It will be interesting to see if Sami Khedira gets a run-in the side considering how little he's played in the seson gone by. Instead, the likes of Toni Kroos and Bastian Schweinsteiger offer much more in that role than the Real Madrid midfielder. The pressing question though, is whether Germany opt for a false nine in Mario Gotze or go for an out and out striker in Miroslav Klose. He has tested the use of a false nine over the last few years now and it is highly likely that the side may use Gotze to fill in that role. Key Players The likes of Gotze, Lukas Podolski, Thomas Muller, Mesut Ozil all add attacking quality to the side and are most likely to provide goals considering the dearth of strikers. The impressive form of defender turned midfielder Phillip Lahm is an encouraging sign for the manager. Lahm spent most of the season as a central midfielder and provides another option in that department. Manuel Neuer, rated as one of the best goalkeepers in the world, will certainly play a key role in ensuring Germany have a successful campaign. Strengths and Weaknesses Germany's major weakness is in their striking department. It is most likely that the side will start with a false nine in Gotze, but Low's experiment has hardly paid off over the past few years where the Germans have looked unconvincing to say the least. The injury to star midfielder Marco Reus comes as a big blow, given that the Dortmund winger was the most in-form German player heading into the tournament. Their midfield though is capable of winning any games. The side has enormous depth and quality to provide both goals and assists and bail them out from pressure situations. The Bayern Munich contigent in the side has had an exceptional domestic season and their form will be key to the side's chances of winning the cup. Expectation As always, Germany will go in the tournament as one of the favourites to lift the World Cup. Low's side have all the quality and depth and anything less than a semi-final finish could be seen as a major disappointment. Their major test though will come towards the end of the tournament and it will be interesting to see, whether they could cope with pressure.  PORTUGAL Profile Titles: None Top Scorer: Cristiano Ronaldo (49) Most Apearances: Luis Figo (127) FIFA Ranking: 4 Star Man: Cristiano Ronaldo Appearances: 110 Goals: 49 Formation 4-3-3   Coach Head coach Paulo Bento has now been a part of the camp for over four years and his quick counter attacking style has benefited the side in recent tournaments. He  has improved this side drastically from the one Carlos Queiroz had and although his side lack the quality the most major teams possess, Bento's Portugal could surprise a few. How they set up Bento's side is expeced to line up in their usual 4-3-3 formation with Helder Postiga being supported by Cristiano Ronaldo and Nani from the wings. The impressive form of William Carvalho this season could see him dethrone Raul Meireles as the defensive midfielder in the side whereas both Joao Moutinho and Miguel Veloso would provide the creative spark for the side. The major factor though will be whether Bento goes for an out and out striker in Postiga or shifts Ronaldo as the center forward. The side has hardly changed from the one that was put out in the Euro 2012 and the counter attacking style is expected to continue in Brazil as well. Key Players Ronaldo will once again be the star man in the Portuguese lineup. The Real Madrid man has had a blistering year playing a key role in the side's tenth European crown. The Real Madrid forward can provide goals, assits and is dangerous from set pieces. Alongside Ronaldo, Portugal's impressive midfield of Meireles, Moutinho will play a key role in assisting Cristiano in attack whereas in form Carvlaho will play a key role as the defensive midfielder in the side. Defensively the form of Pepe and Fabio Coentrao will come as a major boost for Bento and the camp. Strengths and Weaknesses Portugal's strength comes in their industrious midfield and their defensive solidarity. The likes of Bruno Alves, Fabio Coentrao and Pepe provide both defensive certainty as well as attacking threat from set pieces. Of course Ronaldo is their star player and his performances will determine how they shape up in attack. Portugal need to ensure they amalgamate around Ronaldo. Miguel Veloso, Moutinho provide creativity whereas Carvalho and Meireles will provide some much needed cover in their defensive third. Portugal's Achiles Heel has always been their striking department. A Selecao have not found the right man to lead them upfront for some time now and the idea of playing Ronaldo as a striker instead on the wings could backfire. The Real Madrid man has often been delpoyed as a number nine but has failed to flourish in the same manner as he has on the wings. The lack of game time for Manchester United winger Nani could be another issue for Bento in the tournament. The former Sporting manager needs to find the right partner for Ronaldo in attack and at present the options in hand don't look great. Expectation The Portuguese will be expected to progress from the group but it's hard to see them lasting long in the tournament. Anything over quarter-finals will be seen a good achievement  for Bento's side. GHANA Profile Titles: African Cup of Nations ( 1963, 1965, 1978, 1982) Top Scorer: Edward Acquah (40) Most Apearances: Asamoah Gyan (at present-77) FIFA Ranking: 38 Star Man: Asamoah Gyan Appearances: 77 Goals: 39 Formation 4-2-3-1   Coach Coach Kwesi Appiah becomes the only homegrown coach to lead Ghana into the World Cup finals. He is also among the two African coaches in this summers tournament. Appiah is no stranger to this side having led them as a caretaker manager before and was also the assistant manager when the side finished fourth in the African Cup of Nations back in 2013. The Ghanaian is known to provide free flowing attacking football and despite a demanding group, the  Black Stars are expected to continue their exciting brand of football. How they set up Ghana will lineup in their usual 4-2-3-1 formation, with the main focus being on their attack and the stern midfield they have at their disposal. The likes of Micheal Essien, Suley Muntari and Andrew Ayew provide quality as well as experience in the heart of the midfield, whereas Kevin Prince-Boateng will look to play a key role in the attack. Chelsea's youngster Christian Atsu could surprise a few with his skill and flair and can be one of the leading young prospects of the tournament. Appiah's use of 4-4-2 and often 4-5-1 gives them an alternative plan going into the game which could prove to be useful in defending against the likes of Portugal or Germany when needed.  Key Players Asamoah Gyan will look to put away the nightmare of the last World Cup behind him and lead the attack for the Africans. The former Sunderland striker has a knack for goals and his experience in the attack will come in handy. The likes of Essien, Boateng and Muntari will play a major role as well in providing balance to the side. Strengths and Weaknesses Ghana's strength lies in their experience. The likes of Essien, Muntari, Gyan, Boateng have all played for leading European clubs and have the experience of handling pressure situations. Appiah has done well to get the best out of this side on numerous occasions and their impressive qualifying campaign serves as an indication of that. Their major weakness though comes in the defense. As much as their front men look established and well settled, the same cannot be said about their rear guard. The full back position remains one of the major issue of the side as Samuel Inkoom has hardly done enough to warrant a place in the team whereas the center back position looks unsettled too as Appiah still does not know his best back four. Expectation Ghana could surprise a few in this summer's tournament. The squad is experienced and have players capable of producing inspirational moments when needed. They could possibly manage to surpass the group but anything more than that looks a distant dream. U.S.A Profile Titles: CONCACAF Gold Cup (1991, 2002, 2005, 2007, 2013) Top Scorer: Landon Donovan (57) Most Appearances: Cobi Jones (164) FIFA Ranking: 13 Star Man: Clint Dempsey Appearances: 104 Goals: 37 Formation 4-2-3-1   Coach The forer German international and coach, Jurgen Klinsmann will make his second appearance in the World Cup after leading the Germans to a semi-final finish in the 2006 World Cup. The former Bayern Munich manager has based his footballing philosophy on attack over the years and despite having a torrid start to life as US Men's National team coach (USMNT), the German has won over many hearts following their impressive performance in the CONACAF Championships last year. How they set up Klinsmann will look to set his side up in the usual 4-2-3-1 formation with Jozy Altidore leading the side from the front and Clint Dempsey providing the support right behind him. Michael Bradley will play the role of the anchorman in the midfield and will look to provide the key passes, as well as make those forward runs he is so used to. His partner Jermaine Jones is expected to cover up for him and do most of the dirty work in the side. Graham Zusi and Cobi Jones will make up the forward line in the attack alongside Dempsey and their pace and skills will come in handy. Damarcus Beasley's impressive form will see him continue as the left back despite being played as a midfielder for most part of his career, whereas impressive Matt Bresler will lead the defense. Jozy Altidore's strength makes him a good option to have upfront as it will allow him to hold the ball better thus allowing the rest to take part in the attack and providing more options for Klinsmann's men. Key Players One needs to look no further than the two most experienced players in the side in Tim Howard and Clint Dempsey as the star men. The duo have over 200 caps together and could play a key role in the side. Dempsey will have some added pressure on him considering the absence of Landon Donovan from the side this summer. Graham Zusi is another player who will garner much attention. The midfielder has been called up as a replacement for Donovan and a lot of eyes will be on him to deliver and live upto the expectations of his coach. Strengths and Weaknesses USA's major strength lies upfront with the likes of Zusi, Dempsey, Bradley all having a relatively decent seasons with their repective clubs. What will be worrying though is the form of striker Altidore who has had a torrid season for Sunderland this time around. The absence of Donovan though comes as the major blow for the side and could hurt them. Klinsmann might have taken a big step by omitting the star midfielder, but it is a gamble that could backfire. Beasley's impressive performances as a left back comes as a much needed boost for the side. The midfielder turned defender has done well for the national side over the years and could provide necessary cover for the defense. Expectation Not many will give the USMNT a chance to progress from this group. The CONCACAF Champions have a good squad but when pitted against the likes of Portugal and Ghana there is hardly any chance. A group stage exit looks likely. PREDICTION: 1. Germany 2. Portugal 3. Ghana 4. USA	sports

Brazil's World Cup hopes rest on the shoulders of Neymar - Goal.com	The Brazilian is arguably the best player in the Selecao squad and and his form could play a key role in their quest to land the World Cup after 12 long years... COMMENT By Shikharr Chandra On Monday morning, just two days before the opening game of the World Cup Neymar went down holding his ankle at the Teresopolis training ground in front of more than a thousand Brazil fans. There was a sense of anxiety among the supporters who saw their talisman down injured. A few minutes later, the Barcelona forward stood up and placed the ball to practice his free kicks. Neymar curled in three back-to-back free kicks right in the top corner with five men in the wall plus the goal-keeper who were left out as mere spectators. Service was restored in the Brazil camp. Neymar is without doubt the most influential player in this Brazil squad. A player on whom rests the hopes of not only the entire nation but also the millions of Brazil supporters all over the world. The portraits of the former Santos star can be found painted on the streets of Kolkata as well. A flag with 'We don’t score with our hand' printed on it shows the loyalty the city has for the Brazilians and the expectations they have from the 'Prince' of the Selecao. For few years now, Neymar has been the rising star of this Brazil squad. The potential was always there, it was just the matter of how ready the 22-year old was to dawn the famous yellow jersey of Brazil. South American Footballer of the year at the age of 19, Neymar followed it with a Ballon D'Or nomination as well as landing the Puskas award the same year. He had announced himself to the world at such a tender age. Handed over the famous number 10 jersey for Brazil, previously dawned by the likes of Pele and Zico, in him the fans saw their messiah and the team-mates saw a player they could rely on during times of adversity. This was pretty evident with his performances first in the South American Youth Championships, then at the Olympics and later at the Confederations Cup, where he was handed the Golden Ball award for his impressive performances throughout the tournament. While the trust and the confidence bestowed by the fans has been incredible, there is a sense of fret amongst the supporters as well, as to whether their 'Prince' can live upto all the hype that has surrounded him this time around or will he succumb to pressure as many believe he has after his first season at Nou Camp. Neymar's Barcelona journey hasn't gone as planned, both on as well as off the field. The controversy surrounding his transfer usurped the likes of Barcelona president Sandro Rosell and eventually led to a trophyless season with manager Tata Martino being sacked. While many blame it on him not getting his desired role at the club due to the presence of a certain Lionel Messi in the squad, some believe the over the top expectations in his very first season in Europe led to the 'disappointment'. But judging him based on his Barcelona career is rather harsh. For a player born and bred in the South American style of football, it was never going to be easy settling into the European life. In addition to this, the psychological pressure of living up to the transfer fee that still remains one of the biggest mystery of last season. Add to this the constant comparison with Real Madrid's Gareth Bale certainly took a toll on him. His on-field antics did not help his case as well. From 28 starts for Barcelona, Neymar has scored 15 goals and provided 11 assists in all competitions. Flop? Definitely not. Especially when you consider him playing second fiddle to Messi for the majority of the season. At Brazil though, things are different. Luiz Felipe Scolari has based his entire setup to get the best out of his star player. From being deployed on the left flank, Neymar has been given the license to roam around and get as much of the ball as he can. Even striker Fred's duty is too hold the ball and involve the Barcelona forward as much as possible. Scolari knows the potential of Neymar and what he is capable of. When at his best, Neymar is an enticing player, probably on the same level as Cristiano Ronaldo or Messi. Neymar is at his exclusive best when donning the yellow jersey. His dribbling coupled with blistering pace make him a player worth watching on field. He makes things look so simple. The video of him stepping upto take the penalty kick during training and suddenly hitting it with the other leg caught the attention of millions on YouTube. Neymar's skills are not just limited to off-field show boating, on the field as well he has sparkled with the ball on his feet, blazing past defenders and often leaving them for dead. While his upper body strength remains in question as to whether he can handle the persistent fouls that come his way during the tournament, there is little doubt about his mental strength given that he has grown up with challenges in front of him and has consistently delivered on high expectations. The sun shone on Neymar during their game against Panama, and the entire nation will be hoping the sun shines on their wonder boy as he steps out at Sao Paolo tonight. A city that has seen so many struggles and protests lately because of the World Cup, needs its posterboy to step up and provide the trophy they are so obsessed with	sports

Add to this the constant comparison with Real Madrid's Gareth Bale certainly took a toll on him. His on-field antics did not help his case as well. From 28 starts for Barcelona, Neymar has scored 15 goals and provided 11 assists in all competitions. Flop? Definitely not. Especially when you consider him playing second fiddle to Messi for the majority of the season. At Brazil though, things are different. Luiz Felipe Scolari has based his entire setup to get the best out of his star player. From being deployed on the left flank, Neymar has been given the license to roam around and get as much of the ball as he can. Even striker Fred's duty is too hold the ball and involve the Barcelona forward as much as possible. Scolari knows the potential of Neymar and what he is capable of. When at his best, Neymar is an enticing player, probably on the same level as Cristiano Ronaldo or Messi. Neymar is at his exclusive best when donning the yellow jersey. His dribbling coupled with blistering pace make him a player worth watching on field. He makes things look so simple. The video of him stepping upto take the penalty kick during training and suddenly hitting it with the other leg caught the attention of millions on YouTube. Neymar's skills are not just limited to off-field show boating, on the field as well he has sparkled with the ball on his feet, blazing past defenders and often leaving them for dead. While his upper body strength remains in question as to whether he can handle the persistent fouls that come his way during the tournament, there is little doubt about his mental strength given that he has grown up with challenges in front of him and has consistently delivered on high expectations. The sun shone on Neymar during their game against Panama, and the entire nation will be hoping the sun shines on their wonder boy as he steps out at Sao Paolo tonight. A city that has seen so many struggles and protests lately because of the World Cup, needs its posterboy to step up and provide the trophy they are so obsessed with	sports

Karim Bencherifa: I want to win a trophy for Pune FC - Goal.com	The former Mariners coach explains that he is an ardent admirer of his new club's professionalism, hopes to establish an I-League winning team... Karim Bencharifa has stated that he hopes to put the experience he has gained from an ill-fated second reign at Mohun Bagan, to ensure that Pune FC are the ones who gain the most through his mentoring.   Speaking to Goal, Bencherifa was asked to shed light on his stint at Mohun Bagan, which saw the Kolkata stalwarts finish a lowly eighth last season. “It was challenging and difficult but it was another learning experience which will be useful for my coaching carrier. "There were ups and downs, but I was hoping to do much better. For different reasons, it didn't happen. One of my biggest satisfactions is the discovery of some exciting new talents, which is almost impossible to do with the big Kolkata clubs due to the pressure on players and coaches.” Pressurized to describe the intricacies that led to his team’s poor form, Bencherifa chose to be non-committal. “Without going through the details when a team doesn't do well, the coach must take responsibility for that. So one of the reasons is myself but there other reasons which I don't want to elaborate and anyway I am a person who looks forward rather than complaining about the past. Overall there were many good moments and I will remember only this.” Having plied his trade in Goa and Kolkata only, Benncherifa's next job is in a city which isn't traditionally known to be a football hob. “I have no problem with that though I do feel that Pune have many people who know and follow the game. It is up to us to bring them to the stadium and get them interested more in the team, the key is our performances. We, including the players and the staff, have to create a dynamic around the club; play well, win games, be consistent and that's the key,” elucidated Bencherifa, who acknowledged the task at hand. Questioned on his target with the Red Lizards, he expressed hopefulness by stating that he would want to win a trophy with the club who haven't yet laid their hands on silverware. “I wish to help the club get the first silverware. Though Pune FC hasn’t won any trophy yet I think they did a lot for Indian football and the I-League. They brought a lot of professionalism and fresh ideas on how to run a club. "They are a model in youth development and this will definitely work for the benefit of the club in the near future. So I am very hopeful about the outcome of the next season or two.” “Well despite that, I think over the years Pune FC always managed to build quite a strong, competitive team and we will try to do the same this year. The base and core of the team is there already, with some quality youngsters pushing their way to the first team." Pune FC are known not to splurge in the transfer market unlike some of the biggest Kolkata clubs. Bencherifa isn't concerned as he believes a pragmatic approach to finance is always a good option. "There is nothing wrong when a club spends wisely and that’s what usually happens here,” replied Bencherifa. Finally the Moroccan aired his views on a long standing belief, that Pune FC were the most professional team in the country. “As I’ve said before, Pune FC leads the way when it comes to professionalism, from the way they handle and take care of the first team, the organisation of the I-League matches, the setup of the youth development etc. "I am sure there will be much more to come. That’s one of the reasons I am excited to be associated with this club,” concluded Bencherifa, who no doubt wishes to weave an I-League winning campaign at his latest club.  	sports

2014 World Cup Brazil: A Primer - Goal.com	Goal takes time out to deconstruct the facts of the World Cup before it finally gets underway... The greatest tournament on earth is about to get underway in the football capital of the world in Brazil and Goal lays out the basic must know facts for anyone and everyone who wishes to survive for the next month and a half without appearing completely out of the loop.  What is the World Cup?    When the need for an international football competition arose especially after the tremendous popularity of the sport, an amateur competition in the Olympics wasn't enough and a professional pan world competition was the order of the day leading to the 1930 'World Cup' in Uruguay which had seven nations from South America, four from Europe and two from North America with the host nation being victorious, in the inaugural competition. Who organises it? The first global football competition in the Olympics with only amateurs was organised by the FA (Football Association) of Britain. Then came the existence of FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association), a body found in Switzerland by the football associations of Belgium, France, Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden and Germany for organising the game globally. Britain soon became a member and it was in 1950 Brazil that England finally participated in the World Cup which was again won by Uruguay. How many teams participate in the 'World Cup'? Originally it was limited to 16 nations till 1978 and expanded to 24 teams in 1982 and finally to its present number of 32 since 1986. Recently it was proposed by UEFA president Michel Platini, that the World Cup could be extended to 40 nations. "The World Cup is] not based on the quality of the teams because you don't have the best 32 at the World Cup, but it's a good compromise. It's a political matter so why not have more Africans? The competition is to bring all the people of all the world. If you don't give the possibility to participate, they don't improve."  Can we really call it the World Cup?  Not really but it certainly comes close in spite of the domination of the European and South American nations. In the soon to kickoff 2014 World Cup, 13 nations are from Europe, 6 from South America, 4 from North America, 5 from Africa and 4 from Asia. If you were to take the 32 best teams in the world, this would certainly not be it, but this certainly comes close in accordance of FIFA distributing berths regionally. Who is the official mascot of the FIFA World Cup? In keeping with the World Cup tradition of having a mascot, this time it's the turn of a three-banded Brazilian Armaddillo, a species native to Brazil and placed in the UN Red list amongst those vulnerable. Fuleco was the name chosen by fans which is a combination of the words football and ecology. The lively character can be found wearing a white T-shirt with the words 'Brasil 2014'.  Where will the World Cup be played? With the rotatory policy of FIFA, it was the turn of South America to host the 'Cup of Joy' and only Colombia and Brazil were the interested parties. However later with Colombia pulling out, Brazil were the only choice. Twelve venues in Brazil have been selected to host the grand competition with seven brand new and five renovated stadiums. These included popular spots like Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and Brasilia to relatively desolate spots like Manaus, which have no local football team.  What is the reason for all the protests if Brazil is such a football crazy nation? We might think that a zealous football loving nation like Brazil would be overjoyed to host the sport they love. Of course they are, but the ground realities are very harsh. With the nation in an impoverished condition, the people are not taking it too kindly as the Brasil government has bowed down to all the demands of FIFA including tax exemption to the tune of more than 270 million dollars. A Brazil public safety law which prohibited alcohol consumption in stadiums too was turned down because one of the alcohol beverage company was one of the official sponsors of the World Cup. When can I watch the World Cup?  For us in India, the World Cup starts like everyone else from tomorrow. But, with the drastically different time zones, the games will unfortunately be telecasted from midnight to dawn, with kickoffs at 12.30 AM, 1.30 AM, 3.30 AM and 6.30 AM. For the people who cannot stay awake even for this, breathe easy -as there are indeed a couple of matches at primetime which is 9.30 PM. For the complete TV Guide to the World Cup look here.  Why does the World Cup have an official ball?  Since 1970 Adidas has been an official sponsor for FIFA in World Cups and part of this is they get to name the official match ball in the Cup. For the last World Cup, it was christened Jabulani and this time it is Brazuca, the first ball to have its name was chosen by the fans. An interesting fact with regards to the Brazuca, is that the ball was manufactured close to home, by Forward Sports in Sialkot, Pakistan. 	sports

Messi fooled by Ronaldinho lookalike - Goal.com	The Argentina attacker was met by a pitch invader he momentarily took for his former Barcelona team-mate in the Albiceleste's training session on Wednesday By Ben Hayward in Belo Horizonte Lionel Messi was taken by surprise during  Argentina's training session on Wednesday by a pitch invader he briefly mistook for his former Barcelona team-mate and friend Ronaldinho. Argentina trained in front of thousands of fans and press at Belo Horizonte's Estadio Independencia, where Ronaldinho regularly turns out for Atletico Mineiro. After some light running, the Albiceleste squad were divided into small groups for games of football-tennis in a low-key session which finished amid chaos as over a dozen supporters climbed over the fences to invade the pitch and ran in search of a handshake or a hug from their heroes. Most headed in Messi's direction and security guards were overwhelmed in their attempts to halt the fans as the practice was quickly brought to an abrupt end. But the Argentine was initially fooled by the Ronaldinho double. Robinson Oliveira, who works as a professional lookalike of the Brazilian forward, told Goal: "When he saw me he was shocked because he thought I was the real Ronaldinho and he told me that I didn't need to run on the pitch to see him. "He said: 'What are you doing running on here to see me?' When he held my hand, I went down on my knees [and bowed]. It was so emotional." He added: "I didn't plan this. I just thought to myself that I have to hold his hand because this is the only opportunity I will have to see him." The lookalike, who bears an uncanny resemblance to the former Barca hero, ended up with a bloodied hand after scaling the fence in his adventure to meet Messi, but said: "It was worth it." Asked which of the two players he prefers, he replied: "Ronaldinho, of course!" Argentina and Messi kick off their World Cup campaign against Bosnia at the Maracana on Sunday.	sports

'My mission isn't finished' - Blatter to stand for re-election - Goal.com	Despite severe criticism from high-profile figures in football and calls for him to stand down, the leader of world football's governing body says he will stand for election again Sepp Blatter will stand for re-election as Fifa president after the organisation voted against term and age limits for officials. The 78-year-old's widely anticipated announcement that he is to pursue a fifth term in office comes amid a tumultuous week personally in the build-up to the World Cup in Brazil. Blatter branded UK newspaper reports of fresh corruption allegations relating to the voting process for the hosting of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar as racist, bringing sustained criticism from leading figures in Uefa and across European football. Yet, despite this groundswell of continental ill-feeling against Blatter, the vote at the Fifa Congress to reject limits on the age of officials and the lengths of term they can serve demonstrated the widespread support he retains across world football's governing body. Welcomed to the stage with applause as he made his closing remarks in Sao Paulo, Blatter said: "I know that my mandate will finish next year on 29 May in Zurich. But my mission is not finished. "And I tell you together we will build the new Fifa together. We have the foundations today because we have the budget for the next four years. "We have the foundation, now we work. Congress, you will decide who takes this great institution forward. "But I can tell you I am ready to accompany you in the future." Jerome Champagne, whose confirmed candidacy for the Fifa presidency in 2015 has won high-profile support in the form of Pele, made a prompt statement in response to Blatter's announcement. It read: "For the past years and in particular since I declared my candidacy on January 20, 2014 in London, I have been defending the need of a genuine, respectful and fair-play debate on all issues affecting Fifa and football in the 21st century. "Moreover, in any democratic organisation, the election of its president is about vision, programmes and manifestos. No one should fear this open discussion in front of the people of football, which would honour those organising and conducting it." Blatter, meanwhile, also suggested football could follow in the footsteps of cricket by allowing managers two challenges to officials' decisions per game by reviewing instant television replays of contentious incidents - a major departure from his previous caution over introducing greater technology into football. "We could do something more on the field of play," Blatter said. "Why don't we give team managers the possibility of two challenges for refereeing during the match? If the manager disagrees with a decision why should he not ask for an immediate TV review with the referee?" Blatter did sound a far less polarising tone earlier in the day when he called for stronger action to be taken to curb racism in world football. He said: "We must impose the toughest punishment to send a clear message. Suspension and empty stadia is not enough. As coming out of the resoution of last year, we should be docking points, expelling teams, or relegating them. This would be an example for all the others."	sports

'We know how to stop Brazil' - Kovac - Goal.com	The Eastern Europeans meet the tournament hosts to kick off the tournament and the coach is adamant his side can get something from the game Croatia coach Niko Kovac says his team know what they have to do to stop Brazil and Neymar when they meet in the opening match of the World Cup. The two sides kick off the tournament on Thursday at the Corinthians Arena with Brazil the favourites to win the match and the competition outright. But Kovac insists it will be no easy task for Luiz Felipe Scolari's men and says his team are capable of handling them. "We know how to stop Neymar and Brazil," Kovac said at his press conference. "Brazil is not only Neymar - they have a great team, but Croatia also have excellent players. "All those in the team know how nice it is to play for Croatia and how much we love our people. We will leave our heart on the field." The teams last met in the 2006 World Cup in Germany, with Brazil winning 1-0, but Kovac says his side will fight for a good result against the five-time world champions and vowed to attack throughout the game. The coach continued: "In Berlin, we were not able to surprise them, but we will give our best. No surrender - we will attack Brazil! Just as we did in the Serbia friendly. Possession is very important because Brazilians do not like to run for the ball." Croatia captain Dario Srna also vowed to make it difficult for the South American hosts, insisting they will make their fans proud of them. "I cannot promise that we'll go get a group win or beat Brazil, but we'll give every ounce of energy," he said. " It is a big day for us.  All Croatians will be proud.  "The pitch is great and our preparation went great, the conditions in the camp are excellent, arriving in Sao Paulo went without problems.  "Fernandinho and Willian are my friends. We agree that Brazil is the favourite, but they will not find it easy."	sports

'We know how to stop Brazil' - Kovac - Goal.com	The Eastern Europeans meet the tournament hosts to kick off the tournament and the coach is adamant his side can get something from the game Croatia coach Niko Kovac says his team know what they have to do to stop Brazil and Neymar when they meet in the opening match of the World Cup.

'My mission isn't finished' - Blatter to stand for re-election - Goal.com	Despite severe criticism from high-profile figures in football and calls for him to stand down, the leader of world football's governing body says he will stand for election again Sepp Blatter will stand for re-election as Fifa president after the organisation voted against term and age limits for officials. The 78-year-old's widely anticipated announcement that he is to pursue a fifth term in office comes amid a tumultuous week personally in the build-up to the World Cup in Brazil. Blatter branded UK newspaper reports of fresh corruption allegations relating to the voting process for the hosting of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar as racist, bringing sustained criticism from leading figures in Uefa and across European football. Yet, despite this groundswell of continental ill-feeling against Blatter, the vote at the Fifa Congress to reject limits on the age of officials and the lengths of term they can serve demonstrated the widespread support he retains across world football's governing body. Welcomed to the stage with applause as he made his closing remarks in Sao Paulo, Blatter said: "I know that my mandate will finish next year on 29 May in Zurich. But my mission is not finished. "And I tell you together we will build the new Fifa together. We have the foundations today because we have the budget for the next four years. "We have the foundation, now we work. Congress, you will decide who takes this great institution forward. "But I can tell you I am ready to accompany you in the future." Jerome Champagne, whose confirmed candidacy for the Fifa presidency in 2015 has won high-profile support in the form of Pele, made a prompt statement in response to Blatter's announcement. It read: "For the past years and in particular since I declared my candidacy on January 20, 2014 in London, I have been defending the need of a genuine, respectful and fair-play debate on all issues affecting Fifa and football in the 21st century. "Moreover, in any democratic organisation, the election of its president is about vision, programmes and manifestos. No one should fear this open discussion in front of the people of football, which would honour those organising and conducting it." Blatter, meanwhile, also suggested football could follow in the footsteps of cricket by allowing managers two challenges to officials' decisions per game by reviewing instant television replays of contentious incidents - a major departure from his previous caution over introducing greater technology into football. "We could do something more on the field of play," Blatter said. "Why don't we give team managers the possibility of two challenges for refereeing during the match? If the manager disagrees with a decision why should he not ask for an immediate TV review with the referee?" Blatter did sound a far less polarising tone earlier in the day when he called for stronger action to be taken to curb racism in world football. He said: "We must impose the toughest punishment to send a clear message. Suspension and empty stadia is not enough. As coming out of the resoution of last year, we should be docking points, expelling teams, or relegating them. This would be an example for all the others."	sports
Van Persie, Robben and Sneijder are a real threat, admits Martinez - Goal.com	The Spain international admits his side have to be wary of the Dutch trio and says they are desperate to win their opening game of the tournament Spain midfielder Javi Martinez has highlighted Netherlands attackers Robin van Persie, Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder as a real threat to his side's chances in their World Cup opener on Friday. The two teams meet in a replay of the 2010 final, in which an Andres Iniesta goal in extra time clinched the trophy for the Spaniards after Arjen Robben had missed a glorious opportunity on the hour mark. And Martinez believes the reigning European and world champions will have to be wary of his Bayern team-mate along with Van Persie and Sneijder in the re-match. "Their biggest threat are their front three, who are all world class," he told reporters. "Robben is excellent at drifting into space and we will have to watch out for that." The 25-year-old says he has spoken to Robben about that missed chance four years ago. Martinez continued: "We have talked about it in the past couple of years. It was a bitter blow for Holland and him personally. "We've spoken about that match and the one-on-ones against Iker a fair few times. Before the 2013 Champions League final I told him not to blow his opportunity to make amends and he didn't." Martinez believes there is extra pressure on Spain to win their opening game in such a tight group which also consists of Chile and Australia. "After losing our first game last time round, the onus is on us not to do the same thing again," he said. "We showed that it isn't the be-all and end-all in South Africa, but getting off to a good start gives you extra confidence, even though we ended up as champions four years ago." The former Athletic Bilbao player also reflected on last year's Confederations Cup defeat to Brazil, the tournament hosts who are rated as favourites to win this year's tournament. "Brazil were more aggressive than us," conceded Martinez. "We were outclassed and it was a wake-up call. If we're not up for every match, anyone can beat us."	sports

Chelsea boss Mourinho rules out Hazard exit - Goal.com	The Portuguese has no intention of letting the Belgian leave west London despite claiming that he was "not ready to sacrifice himself 100 per cent for the team" last term Jose Mourinho has dismissed speculation surrounding Eden Hazard's future, declaring that the Belgian will not be allowed to leave Chelsea this summer. The 23-year-old had been heavily linked with French champions Paris Saint-Germain, with Laurent Blanc publicly expressing interest in the attacker, though Hazard has since said he is certain to remain in London. And Mourinho, despite having been critical of Hazard during last season's Premier League run-in, has now confirmed that he has no intention of letting the former Lille man leave Stamford Bridge. "Just because I say that Eden does not have everything, it doesn't mean I don't want him," the Portuguese told L'Equipe. "He has fantastic potential and will express it at Chelsea. For him, as for others, the door is closed. People who know me know that, when I say that, I mean it." Hazard was Chelsea's top scorer in the Premier League last season, netting 14 times, while he also made seven assists. Though the west Londoners have already sold David Luiz to PSG, as well as releasing Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole, Hazard is highly unlikely to join them in leaving Chelsea and is in the process of sealing a contract extension. "I am staying at Chelsea, [that is] 100 per cent sure," he told Le Derniere Heure on Monday. "I am in discussions with Chelsea for a new contract. "It is only the beginning of the talks right now so we have got time but the fact that Chelsea have offered me a new deal means that they have got a lot of confidence in me that I can do a good job and that they can count on me."	sports

Pirlo: Italy must be careful against improving England - Goal.com	The veteran Juventus midfielder says that the Azzurri "know how to face" Saturday's Group D opponents, though he urges caution against the Three Lions' young, fast starlets Italy midfielder Andrea Pirlo has warned his team-mates that they can expect to face a different and much-improved England side than the one whom they sent crashing out of Euro 2012. The two sides meet in Manaus on Saturday in their opening game of the World Cup, a repeat of their quarter-final clash two years ago in Kiev, in which the Azzurri progressed after a penalty shootout. But Pirlo is not taking the Three Lions' threat lightly, highlighting the emergence of youth within England's ranks, though he is confident that Cesare Prandelli's men are capable of coming out on top. "We know England are a good team that has improved a lot," he told reporters. "They have new, young players, who are fast. We will have to be careful. "However, we know how to face them. Italy have always played great games against England and hence we will have our chances." Pirlo was instrumental in Italy's victory over England in Ukraine, famously completing more passes than Roy Hodgson's entire midfield combined, but he insists that the four-time World Cup winners are more than a one-man team. "This national team is not Pirlo-dependent," the 35-year-old argued. "In order to go all the way you need everyone's contribution. "Our aim should be to win and go until the end. We have a very competitive team and we will give our all to win this tournament. I never compete to take part but to finish first."	sports

I want to replicate PSG success with Milan - Menez - Goal.com	The France international says Pippo Inzaghi's outfit have the ability in their squad to challenge at the top again following a difficult 2013-14 campaign Jeremy Menez says he wants to have the same success with AC Milan that he enjoyed with Paris Saint-Germain. The France international joined PSG from Roma in 2011 and has since won two consecutive Ligue 1 titles and reached the Champions League quarter-finals in each of the last two seasons. The 27-year-old attacker arrived in Italy on Wednesday to undergo a medical ahead of his proposed move to the San Siro giants, and told reporters he is keen to repeat his experiences in the French capital upon donning the Milan shirt. "I'm very happy, I want to win with this shirt as I did with PSG," he admitted after landing in Lombardy. "Why Milan? Because it's a big team, not just a big club. I really hope to do well." Menez returns to Italy to become new coach Filippo Inzaghi's first signing as the club attempt to put a disappointing 2013-14 campaign behind them. But having previously spent three years with Roma before his transfer to Paris three years ago, he insists that he will show on the field of play just how his game has progressed since his last spell in Serie A. "Differences between this Menez and the old one? You will see on the pitch. Compared to four years ago, I have grown a lot and I want to prove it on the field." Menez spent Wednesday evening dining with Milan CEO Adriano Galliani and will undergo a medical at the club's Milanello complex on Thursday ahead of signing a €4.5 million-a-year, three-year deal.	sports

England can't handle the World Cup pressure, says Vialli - Goal.com	The former Chelsea player and manager feels that the Three Lions have a habit of crumbling at major tournaments, though he acknowledges that they could pose Italy problems Gianluca Vialli believes Italy will handle the pressure of the World Cup better than Group D rivals England. The 49-year-old, who was at Chelsea for four years before later managing Watford, thinks that players who do well in the Premier League find it hard to cope with the expectation at major international tournaments. With the Azzurri first up for the Three Lions in Manaus on Saturday, Vialli is confident that his nation will be in better shape, claiming that they "eat pressure for breakfast". He told Perform: "I think it's quite funny with England because, for about four years, all the England fans and the England players feel a bit depressed and disillusioned when it comes to the England side and then, one month before the World Cup starts, everybody sort of starts feeling that they [will] naturally win it and everybody feels super-confident. "I think that England fans should try to find a balance in between both state of minds but I think the England players find it quite difficult when they play in the World Cup because they are not used to the pressure. "When they play in the Premiership, when they play Manchester United versus Chelsea, for example, or Arsenal, there's no pressure; it's actually quite fun to play. "You know that there are no consequences if you don't do well, as long as you do your best on the pitch, and therefore, when they play for the national team, when they wear the England shirt, all of a sudden they realise they are representing their country. They feel there is a massive expectation, there's a lot of scrutiny and a lot of consequences. "It's the inability to handle the pressure that makes a big difference between between the Italian players and the England players when it comes to the World Cup stage. "The Italian players, they eat pressure for breakfast so they grow up with a lot of pressure and they know how to handle it. "Also [Italy] are very good at winning games even though we are not playing at our best, which is something that England players need to learn quite fast if they want to succeed in the World Cup because there will be one or two games where you will not be performing so you need to be able to win it anyway. Historically we are very good at that." Although Vialli is not convinced by England's ability to perform under intense pressure, he acknowledges that they are more than capable of posing a threat on Saturday. "I think England are a very exciting side because they have got so many young, talented, creative players playing up front," he added. "The likes of [Daniel] Sturridge, [Wayne] Rooney, and [Raheem] Sterling, [Adam] Lallana, [Danny] Welbeck, they can turn hot quickly and can create problems for the opposition. "They need to be a bit more clinical, though, because there won't be many goalscoring opportunities so they need to take their chances when they can."	sports

Beating Brazil in the final would be like an orgasm, says Maradona - Goal.com	The 53-year-old says he would love to see his country beat their South American rivals in the final and told Pele to go 'back to the museum' Argentina legend Diego Maradona claims that beating hosts and bitter rivals Brazil in the World Cup final would be "like an orgasm". Maradona, who famously helped guide his country to World Cup glory in 1986, believes Alejandro Sabella's men should be aiming to at least reach the final at Maracana on July 13.  Both Argentina and Brazil are among the tournament favourites, but Sabella's side will first have to escape Group F, which also contains debutants Bosnia-Herzegovina, Iran and Nigeria. If Argentina were to reach the final and subsequently pip five-time world champions Brazil to the title, Maradona has no doubts that it would be the perfect victory. The 53-year-old told Diario Ole: "Hopefully they can do it [reach the final]. The target will be to reach that point. "There, Argentina can open up against Brazil, who will surely be in the final. To beat Brazil in the final would be like an orgasm." The former Barcelona and Napoli star also continued his long-standing feud with Brazil legend Pele before dismissing comparisons between Neymar and Lionel Messi. "How have I been received in Brazil? Better than Pele, although that is not saying much," he continued. "You can tell Pele to go back to the museum. It's clear that the distance between Messi and Neymar is the same between Maradona and Pele. "Neymar is today's Pele. In Brazil he is bigger, everyone is looking to him as the great figure of Brazilian football." Maradona also believes Messi will be able to hit his best form for Argentina this year, something he hasn't done at a major international tournament as of yet. "If an individual inspires the team with his brilliance, it helps immensely," he wrote in Times of India. "That is why I believe the presence of Messi and Ronaldo will help Argentina and Portugal play better. "These two are the best of this generation and both are yet to play at the best of their abilities in the biggest tournament."	sports

Italy playmaker Andrea Pirlo confident ahead of England World Cup 2014 clash - Telegraph	It is little wonder, then, that there is talk of Hodgson specifically adapting his formation to deal with the unique threat of a playmaker who operates so far behind the main striker. Pirlo is confident that the Italian midfield will simply use their movement to ensure that any man-marking strategy would be doomed to failure. Italy tested out a 4-1-3-1-1 formation during their training session on Wednesday and have been constantly tweaking their system during the build-up matches. Daniele De Rossi and Marco Verratti are expected to start but the one certainty is that manager Cesare Prandelli will give Pirlo the freedom to influence the game however he sees fit. “We tried this new solution with a midfielder in front of the defence and two further forward with more freedom,” said Pirlo. “We aim to rotate the midfield positions to keep our opponents guessing. "We like this option, it can give great results and we are working to improve every day. We can try many different approaches but it is also down to how you interpret the role. In truth it’s a system that involves rotation, as we go forward and at other times I’d come back into the more classic position.” Italy’s form in the warm-up matches will have prompted few alarm bells with England. True, they found their goalscoring touch in dispatching Fluminense 5-3 on Sunday but were winless in six previously during a sequence that even included an embarrassing 1-1 draw with Luxembourg. Pirlo was part of the Italy team that won the 2006 World Cup and he is still adamant that a repeat is possible. He also dismissed questions about his own elite status and the suggestion that Italy had become dependent upon him. “I was never interested in being a world star,” he said. “I think about enjoying - you journalists make the world stars. No. We are 23 players at the disposal of the coach and know to go all the way we need a contribution from everyone, as we learned in 2006. “Can Italy win the World Cup? Of course. When I play, it is solely to win. I am never just content with getting through the round. We have a competitive squad and will give our all to achieve this objective. We have the chance to make this a World Cup to be remembered for all our lives. We have what it takes to go far. The important thing is to believe, sacrifice ourselves, work hard and the results can arrive.” That process begins on Saturday, with Pirlo hinting that he could yet renege on a previous plan to retire from international football after this World Cup. At 35, his hunger to keep playing in club football was underlined on Wednesday by confirmation of a new two-year contract at Juventus. “I intend to quit international football after this World Cup but if I am needed...” said Pirlo. “I am still thinking of retiring, as I have a certain age and it’s only right to leave the field to the next generation coming through. It would be pointless to continue. “If I am needed, then there’s no problem in coming back. But if I come on international duty and don’t play, then I’d get angry. So it’s perhaps better I stay home.” It was a mercurial answer but typical of the one player who adds fantasy to an Italy team that still lack a certain flair. In his recent autobiography, Pirlo made a point of acknowledging how Juninho Pernambucano had inspired his free-kick technique and the former Brazil midfielder was even a guest on Wednesday at Casa Azzurri. “Pirlo is a demon, he not only copied my shot but improved it - if I was still playing I’d ask him to teach me,” said Juninho. Pirlo digested the compliment, gratefully accepted a Brazil shirt with his name on it and then delivered an even better sound-bite of his own. “Juninho was very kind to me, we were both emotional,” he said. “I’m Italian, but I’m also part Brazilian - Pirlinho, if you like.”	sports
Neymar: I had a Ronaldo haircut in 2002 - Goal.com	Il Fenomeno made headlines for his appearance as much as his on-field heroics in Japan and South Korea, but the Barcelona star admits he mimicked the look of his idol By Kris Voakes in Sao Paulo Neymar has revealed he sported the same outrageous hairstyle as Ronaldo during Brazil's triumphant 2002 World Cup campaign. Ronaldo notched eight goals - including two in the final against Germany - to finish clear at the top of the scoring charts in Japan and South Korea, but made as many headlines for his appearance as his on-field heroics. The former Real Madrid striker shaved off all his hair except a section at the front, with the look since regularly topping lists of the worst haircuts in football history. But Neymar admits his admiration for Il Fenomeno prompted him to follow suit during the tournament, even though he claims he has forgotten most of the context of Brazil's fifth World Cup victory. "In 2002, I had a haircut like Ronaldo's but I don't remember much," he told reporters at a press conference in Sao Paulo ahead of Thursday's tournament opener against Croatia. "I remember celebrating. "Romario and Ronaldo are the two star players that I always think of when we talk about World Cups, especially 2002. "I get inspiration from all players all over the world, players like Messi and Ronaldo, but I hope to follow my path together with my team."	sports

Wayne Rooney says he has no excuses with England at World Cup 2014 - Telegraph	“Maybe you guys, the media, have put me under a lot of pressure and I’ve tried to respond to that. This time I haven’t and I’m not going to. I’m going to enjoy it. I’m excited for this tournament. I’m enjoying working with the younger lads and the experienced lads. I really believe we can do well. “I’ve learnt to enjoy this one because I haven’t enjoyed the last ones, they’ve not gone well. All of a sudden you’re looking back and they’ve gone and I didn’t enjoy it. I’m going to make sure I take positive memories from this one. I hope so. I know the last tournaments haven’t gone well for me and, if this one doesn’t, I’ll have no excuses. I’ve prepared well for it.’’ Rooney is certainly better prepared than at the 2010 World Cup when he railed against England fans in Cape Town after their dissent towards a dreadful display against Algeria. “I regret that. It was the heat of the moment and it happened, and you move on. Listen, I’ll do my best for England and I’m sure the fans see that. All fans have favourite players. I’m sure the English Man United fans like me! It was stupid of me but it was a frustrating time. “The hardest thing about last time was I missed my family, and this time I’ve learnt to deal with that. Of course I miss them. They’ll be over here eventually. Not with me but they will be. To be honest, it’s good to get a few days’ rest!” Rooney has two sons, aged four and one, and the elder is beginning to note the focus on his father. “For instance, towards the end of last season, when I walked out at Old Trafford the fans were shouting and he was asking why. He’s not a massive football fan. He’s not really into it at the minute. He’s still young. I’m sure, in time, it’ll come.” As well as the maturing effects of fatherhood, Rooney’s equanimity has been helped by talking to the sports psychologist, Dr Steve Peters, who is travelling with England. “I’ve spoken to him a few times. He’s a great benefit for the team. I found him great and easy to talk to.’’ The tournament he enjoyed most was Euro 2004 when he was a teenager, playing without fear, just loving the occasion. “I did enjoy that one. I was doing well. That’s the good thing about the younger lads in the squad, like Ross [Barkley] and Raheem (Sterling). You can see that there’s no fear with them. They’ll be good players, big players for us.” He will tell them to “enjoy it”, adding “You have to enjoy the moment”. Against Ecuador in the Miami friendly, when the focus was on him after injury and some travails in front of goal, Rooney celebrated wildly scoring from three yards. “One yard! I know this is a big tournament for me which I want to do well in, so I was delighted to score. If you look at my record in us qualifying for this World Cup, I had a pretty good record. I hadn’t done too well in the friendlies, but when it counted in the qualifiers, it happened. That’s what I have to do again in this tournament.’’ He is currently on 39 goals, 10 short of Sir Bobby Charlton’s England record which he wants to beat. “It would be great,’’ said the 28-year-old. “At my age, I should break that record. I just want to keep playing, keep trying to score. If I can get Sir Bobby’s record it would be a massive achievement. I’d be absolutely delighted. I want to score goals and help England be successful. If I play well, the team will play well. I feel better than I have done for years. I’m ready for this tournament.’’ He did not particularly appreciate the critical comments from his former team-mate, Paul Scholes, about his having peaked as a player. “I don’t agree with it. I’m sure he’s upset a lot of people at Man United because they see me as worthy of signing a new deal at the club, so they obviously have got a different opinion to what Paul has.’’ Unlike Jack Wilshere, another victim of Scholes’s new role as a pugnacious pundit, Rooney has not bothered to contact Scholes. “I’ve never had his phone number and he’s never had mine,’’ said Rooney, giving an insight into how private a person Scholes was at Old Trafford. “He’s been a great player at Man United, probably the best player I’ve ever played with, so I’m not going to knock him as a player, but I don’t agree with his point.” Handling criticism goes with the territory of being England’s most-scrutinised, most high-profile player. “I’ve always responded well in the dressing room if I’m not doing well and if someone is shouting at me. I have no problem with that. You can see some players it really affects them. It’s not something I get concerned with.” At the start of the season, the then United manager David Moyes suggested that Rooney had gone “soft”. The pair discussed this. “He didn’t call me in. I went to see him. He felt I had lost a bit of aggression out of my game – which I was asked to do, by the way. He said he wanted me to find that aggression back. It [his discipline] was blown up after the sending off against Montenegro [in 2011]. Before that my record in terms of discipline and bookings wasn’t that bad. I was asked to stop doing that – stupid tackles. “Maybe I was trying to do too much. I thought about it a lot. It wasn’t really me. Maybe there are times when you have to try and lift the crowd with a tackle, obviously not a stupid one. A run back and tackle can lift the fans and even turn a game round.” His thoughts now turn to Italy on Saturday. In training at Urca yesterday, Rooney played central, having started left against Honduras. “I’m happy to play anywhere,’’ he said. “But if you look at the way we play, it’s not out and out on the left wing. You’re playing more inside, you’re coming inside off the line. Whoever is playing No 10, wide or up top, the manager [Roy Hodgson] gives us the freedom to rotate.’’ He knows the Italians will be a test. “The Italian defenders I’ve played against tend to read the game really well. They put themselves in good positions. But if I’m being honest, when you play a high tempo they’ve struggled. The Italian league is nowhere near the tempo of the Premier League. Even when we played AC Milan, with [Alessandro] Nesta and [Paolo] Maldini the centre-halves, they really struggled when we played a high tempo. If we can do that I am sure we will give them problems.” Rooney believes England have that tempo. “We’ve got a lot of energy, a lot of pace in the team, and if we can pick the right moments we can really hurt teams with the pace and tempo that we can hit them at. But, at international football, you can’t just go out there and attack, attack, attack. We have to be a bit cautious. This is the top end of football and you might get picked off. We have to stick to our plans that we’ve worked on in the last few weeks and pick the right moment.” Italian defenders are also masters at the dark arts of baulking, checking, ensuring strikers are unable to get close to the ball. “They are but everyone is learning that now; 10-15 years ago it was different but with the amount of foreign players in our league now, even English players are learning it now.’’ If England play against Italy as fluidly and intelligently as Rooney spoke yesterday, they might just have a chance. - Paul Hayward: Prepare for a joyous, nerve-shredding, ludicrous drama - Alan Hansen: Brazil were the best team I faced - I bared had a kick - Manaus groundsman: Pitch for England's game is in poor shape	sports

I hope to settle in as quickly as possible."	sports
Scolari: Current Brazil side as good as Ronaldo's 2002 champions - Goal.com	Host nation are well placed to repeat their success in South Korea and Japan, according to their coach, who oversaw the talents of Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and Rivaldo at that event By Kris Voakes at the Arena Corinthians, Sao Paulo Luiz Felipe Scolari says that his Brazil squad are “collectively the same” as the team he led to World Cup victory in 2002. Speaking at the Arena Corinthians, where Brazil will kick-off the 2014 showpiece on Thursday against Croatia, the Selecao coach told the world’s media that his current crop can emulate the Ronaldo-inspired success of 12 years ago. “I would say that this squad and the 2002 squad are collectively the same,” said Scolari. “There was an ability in that squad which helped to change games tactically. “This squad has players that change their games to help the team. For instance, Neymar helps to mark players if it helps the whole team." ‘Big Phil’ added that he feels his troops are ready to fulfil the dreams of the entire host nation. "We want to thank president Dilma Rousseff for her words of support and also the fans from across the country who are backing us. “The time has arrived, we are going together. This is our World Cup.” Scolari has been hit by the deaths of his brother-in-law and nephew in the build-up to the finals beginning, but he says that football has helped him to move forward as the World Cup approaches. “Yes, we have gone through difficult times together, but life goes on,” he added. “We do what we have to do and we go on. Each of us has a path to follow. “I find my strength from working with these players who dedicate themselves every day and are always trying to improve. All this helps us forget the sadness and see the beauty of what is happening around you.” Niko Kovac’s Croatia side are likely to give Brazil a tough test in their opening Group A fixture, and Scolari insists that he is focused entirely on the events of Thursday night. “I'm thinking only of tomorrow, because we have seven steps to take and we cannot jump the first of those steps. “We have prepared well, we are all fit to play, and everything that was planned was excellent… I will sleep well tonight.”	sports
Pirlo: This World Cup will be my last - Goal.com	The midfielder made his international debut 12 years ago but admits he is unlikely to be available for the national team after the tournament in Brazil Andrea Pirlo has admitted he plans to retire from international duty after this World Cup unless he is desperately needed by Italy. The midfielder has been a member of the national team since 2002 and lifted the 2006 World Cup as well as reaching the Euro 2012 final with the Azzurri. After 12 years of service, the 35-year-old is ready to bring an end to his international career unless Cesare Prandelli is struggling for options if he is not available for selection. "I'm still thinking of retiring after this World Cup, as I have reached a certain age and it is only right to leave the pitch to the generation coming through," the Juventus star told reporters. "It would be pointless to continue. If I am needed, then there’s no problem in coming back. If I come on international duty and don’t play, then I’d get angry. It is perhaps better I stay home." Pirlo was then asked about Mario Balotelli and he believes the striker's goal drought will come to an end soon. The Juventus star said: "Strikers score goals, so when they don’t come then perhaps he gets a little upset, but he just needs to focus on playing for the team and then a goal will arrive as a consequence of that. "It is the dream of every player to be at a World Cup in Brazil, the nation of football. It’s not something that happens often, so we have the chance to make this a World Cup to be remembered for all our lives." Italy are without a win in seven matches as they prepare to face Costa Rica, England and Uruguay in the group stage. 	sports
Wayne Rooney says he has no excuses with England at World Cup 2014 - Telegraph	“Maybe you guys, the media, have put me under a lot of pressure and I’ve tried to respond to that. This time I haven’t and I’m not going to. I’m going to enjoy it. I’m excited for this tournament. I’m enjoying working with the younger lads and the experienced lads. I really believe we can do well. “I’ve learnt to enjoy this one because I haven’t enjoyed the last ones, they’ve not gone well. All of a sudden you’re looking back and they’ve gone and I didn’t enjoy it. I’m going to make sure I take positive memories from this one. I hope so. I know the last tournaments haven’t gone well for me and, if this one doesn’t, I’ll have no excuses. I’ve prepared well for it.’’ Rooney is certainly better prepared than at the 2010 World Cup when he railed against England fans in Cape Town after their dissent towards a dreadful display against Algeria. “I regret that. It was the heat of the moment and it happened, and you move on. Listen, I’ll do my best for England and I’m sure the fans see that. All fans have favourite players. I’m sure the English Man United fans like me! It was stupid of me but it was a frustrating time. “The hardest thing about last time was I missed my family, and this time I’ve learnt to deal with that. Of course I miss them. They’ll be over here eventually. Not with me but they will be. To be honest, it’s good to get a few days’ rest!” Rooney has two sons, aged four and one, and the elder is beginning to note the focus on his father. “For instance, towards the end of last season, when I walked out at Old Trafford the fans were shouting and he was asking why. He’s not a massive football fan. He’s not really into it at the minute. He’s still young. I’m sure, in time, it’ll come.” As well as the maturing effects of fatherhood, Rooney’s equanimity has been helped by talking to the sports psychologist, Dr Steve Peters, who is travelling with England. “I’ve spoken to him a few times. He’s a great benefit for the team. I found him great and easy to talk to.’’ The tournament he enjoyed most was Euro 2004 when he was a teenager, playing without fear, just loving the occasion. “I did enjoy that one. I was doing well. That’s the good thing about the younger lads in the squad, like Ross [Barkley] and Raheem (Sterling). You can see that there’s no fear with them. They’ll be good players, big players for us.” He will tell them to “enjoy it”, adding “You have to enjoy the moment”. Against Ecuador in the Miami friendly, when the focus was on him after injury and some travails in front of goal, Rooney celebrated wildly scoring from three yards. “One yard! I know this is a big tournament for me which I want to do well in, so I was delighted to score. If you look at my record in us qualifying for this World Cup, I had a pretty good record. I hadn’t done too well in the friendlies, but when it counted in the qualifiers, it happened. That’s what I have to do again in this tournament.’’ He is currently on 39 goals, 10 short of Sir Bobby Charlton’s England record which he wants to beat. “It would be great,’’ said the 28-year-old. “At my age, I should break that record. I just want to keep playing, keep trying to score. If I can get Sir Bobby’s record it would be a massive achievement. I’d be absolutely delighted. I want to score goals and help England be successful. If I play well, the team will play well. I feel better than I have done for years. I’m ready for this tournament.’’ He did not particularly appreciate the critical comments from his former team-mate, Paul Scholes, about his having peaked as a player. “I don’t agree with it. I’m sure he’s upset a lot of people at Man United because they see me as worthy of signing a new deal at the club, so they obviously have got a different opinion to what Paul has.’’ Unlike Jack Wilshere, another victim of Scholes’s new role as a pugnacious pundit, Rooney has not bothered to contact Scholes. “I’ve never had his phone number and he’s never had mine,’’ said Rooney, giving an insight into how private a person Scholes was at Old Trafford. “He’s been a great player at Man United, probably the best player I’ve ever played with, so I’m not going to knock him as a player, but I don’t agree with his point.” Handling criticism goes with the territory of being England’s most-scrutinised, most high-profile player. “I’ve always responded well in the dressing room if I’m not doing well and if someone is shouting at me. I have no problem with that. You can see some players it really affects them. It’s not something I get concerned with.” At the start of the season, the then United manager David Moyes suggested that Rooney had gone “soft”. The pair discussed this. “He didn’t call me in. I went to see him. He felt I had lost a bit of aggression out of my game – which I was asked to do, by the way. He said he wanted me to find that aggression back. It [his discipline] was blown up after the sending off against Montenegro [in 2011]. Before that my record in terms of discipline and bookings wasn’t that bad. I was asked to stop doing that – stupid tackles. “Maybe I was trying to do too much. I thought about it a lot. It wasn’t really me. Maybe there are times when you have to try and lift the crowd with a tackle, obviously not a stupid one. A run back and tackle can lift the fans and even turn a game round.” His thoughts now turn to Italy on Saturday. In training at Urca yesterday, Rooney played central, having started left against Honduras. “I’m happy to play anywhere,’’ he said. “But if you look at the way we play, it’s not out and out on the left wing. You’re playing more inside, you’re coming inside off the line. Whoever is playing No 10, wide or up top, the manager [Roy Hodgson] gives us the freedom to rotate.’’ He knows the Italians will be a test. “The Italian defenders I’ve played against tend to read the game really well. They put themselves in good positions. But if I’m being honest, when you play a high tempo they’ve struggled. The Italian league is nowhere near the tempo of the Premier League. Even when we played AC Milan, with [Alessandro] Nesta and [Paolo] Maldini the centre-halves, they really struggled when we played a high tempo. If we can do that I am sure we will give them problems.” Rooney believes England have that tempo. “We’ve got a lot of energy, a lot of pace in the team, and if we can pick the right moments we can really hurt teams with the pace and tempo that we can hit them at. But, at international football, you can’t just go out there and attack, attack, attack. We have to be a bit cautious. This is the top end of football and you might get picked off. We have to stick to our plans that we’ve worked on in the last few weeks and pick the right moment.” Italian defenders are also masters at the dark arts of baulking, checking, ensuring strikers are unable to get close to the ball. “They are but everyone is learning that now; 10-15 years ago it was different but with the amount of foreign players in our league now, even English players are learning it now.’’ If England play against Italy as fluidly and intelligently as Rooney spoke yesterday, they might just have a chance. - Paul Hayward: Prepare for a joyous, nerve-shredding, ludicrous drama - Alan Hansen: Brazil were the best team I faced - I bared had a kick - Manaus groundsman: Pitch for England's game is in poor shape	sports
World Cup 2014: Luiz Felipe Scolari tells Brazilians 'this is our time' ahead of Croatia opener - Telegraph	For Scolari, who described himself as a “coach, a father, an uncle, a friend, someone who has to speak a bit harsh” to his players, there was also the personal tragedies of first losing his brother-in-law, in late May, and then, this week, his nephew during the days in the run-up to this match. “Yes we have gone through difficult times together and we know what this means,” Scolari said. “But life goes on and we do what we have to do. And we go on. Each one has a path to follow and I find my strength from working with these players. These players dedicate themselves every day and work. “They are always trying to improve and all this makes us, even when we are feeling sad, forget the sadness and feel the beauty around us. Arriving here at the airport, at the Corinthians stadium, it is a beautiful stadium and we forget the sad aspects and think of the 99 per cent of positive things in our lives.” To Scolari’s left is Neymar, the 22-year-old striker who is his country’s great hope and poster boy for this tournament, who has willingly taken the mythical No 10 Brazil shirt, and who happily says he is prepared to embrace the weight of that expectation. “As Mr Scolari has said the time has arrived that all Brazil and the whole world was waiting for,” Neymar said. “We hope that this last day goes by very quickly. I am anxious of course but I am also extremely happy to be where I am. Many people would like to be here. I have many messages from my friends saying I have achieved their dreams. “The 12th player – or even the main player of the Brazilian squad – are the supporters. We are at home and if the supporters are behind us 100 per cent it will be very difficult to beat Brazil.” There is ambitious hope that the Barcelona striker can surpass both Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo – the two “star players” that Neymar himself admires and draws “inspiration” from – and become this tournament’s outstanding performer. If he does so then surely Brazil will triumph? “I want to be the best player at the World Cup. I don’t want to just be the striker,” Neymar acknowledged. “I want to win the World Cup. That is what I have always dreamt of.” Scolari nodded approvingly as Neymar spoke and in the questioning from Brazilian journalists there was as much a sense of seeking reassurance as any attempt at analysis. “I try to be the coach I always was,” Scolari said as, unsurprisingly, comparisons were drawn between this squad of players and those who won the World Cup with him in Japan 12 years ago. “I always worked this way, I was never a coach in a different manner even if it was a big team or a small team. I think I am a mixture of everything you said – a father, an uncle, a friend, someone who has to speak a bit harsh. I am a football coach the way that most coaches are. You have to have leadership and have to command them and you have to study and define situations and above all take decisions.” Scolari has been decisive. It appears he has ignored demands to change the team that triumphed in last summer’s Confederations Cup, his faith in Oscar and Paulinho, two out-of-sorts Premier League performers, appears unshakeable. “We are ready,” Scolari said. He was convincing.	sports

"You've got to have a great team spirit," he said. "Roman has said himself that there is no point in arguing about who should be number one. "He would be ready to play at any time, but he knows the overall situation. The players are pushing each other to greater things with their performances."	sports

Arsenal have not indicated they want to activate a buy-back clause on Fabregas and the Spaniard is keen to return to the Premier League. Chelsea have been trying to structure a deal to sign Fabregas that would see Arsenal miss out on any payment for him. Arsenal would be due around 50 per cent of any profit Barcelona make on the Spaniard, but a £27m transfer would not be enough to earn the Gunners a sell-on fee.	sports
World Cup 2014: Luiz Felipe Scolari tells Brazilians 'this is our time' ahead of Croatia opener - Telegraph	For Scolari, who described himself as a “coach, a father, an uncle, a friend, someone who has to speak a bit harsh” to his players, there was also the personal tragedies of first losing his brother-in-law, in late May, and then, this week, his nephew during the days in the run-up to this match. “Yes we have gone through difficult times together and we know what this means,” Scolari said. “But life goes on and we do what we have to do. And we go on. Each one has a path to follow and I find my strength from working with these players. These players dedicate themselves every day and work. “They are always trying to improve and all this makes us, even when we are feeling sad, forget the sadness and feel the beauty around us. Arriving here at the airport, at the Corinthians stadium, it is a beautiful stadium and we forget the sad aspects and think of the 99 per cent of positive things in our lives.” To Scolari’s left is Neymar, the 22-year-old striker who is his country’s great hope and poster boy for this tournament, who has willingly taken the mythical No 10 Brazil shirt, and who happily says he is prepared to embrace the weight of that expectation. “As Mr Scolari has said the time has arrived that all Brazil and the whole world was waiting for,” Neymar said. “We hope that this last day goes by very quickly. I am anxious of course but I am also extremely happy to be where I am. Many people would like to be here. I have many messages from my friends saying I have achieved their dreams. “The 12th player – or even the main player of the Brazilian squad – are the supporters. We are at home and if the supporters are behind us 100 per cent it will be very difficult to beat Brazil.” There is ambitious hope that the Barcelona striker can surpass both Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo – the two “star players” that Neymar himself admires and draws “inspiration” from – and become this tournament’s outstanding performer. If he does so then surely Brazil will triumph? “I want to be the best player at the World Cup. I don’t want to just be the striker,” Neymar acknowledged. “I want to win the World Cup. That is what I have always dreamt of.” Scolari nodded approvingly as Neymar spoke and in the questioning from Brazilian journalists there was as much a sense of seeking reassurance as any attempt at analysis. “I try to be the coach I always was,” Scolari said as, unsurprisingly, comparisons were drawn between this squad of players and those who won the World Cup with him in Japan 12 years ago. “I always worked this way, I was never a coach in a different manner even if it was a big team or a small team. I think I am a mixture of everything you said – a father, an uncle, a friend, someone who has to speak a bit harsh. I am a football coach the way that most coaches are. You have to have leadership and have to command them and you have to study and define situations and above all take decisions.” Scolari has been decisive. It appears he has ignored demands to change the team that triumphed in last summer’s Confederations Cup, his faith in Oscar and Paulinho, two out-of-sorts Premier League performers, appears unshakeable. “We are ready,” Scolari said. He was convincing.	sports

Firefighters veto provisional stands at World Cup stadium - Goal.com	The Arena das Dunas site has not passed a safety inspection and is not yet in position to host Friday's opening game between Mexico and Cameroon Brazil’s overdue and over-budget World Cup 2014 preparations have been plunged into further chaos following news that the Arena das Dunas in Natal may not be ready for its opening match of the tournament. Mexico are due to face Cameroon on Friday in what is scheduled to be the first match held at the stadium. While Secopa (Extraordinary Secretary for World Cup Related Subjects) has guaranteed that the stadium is all but finished, the fire department responsible for signing the order of release for the use of the site disagree. According to firefighters, there should have been a safety inspection of the site on Tuesday, but they were not authorised to make their visit, meaning that the stadium is yet to be cleared to host matches. The Arena de Sao Paulo, the stadium scheduled to host the opening game of the tournament between Brazil and Croatia on Thursday, faced similar issues. The Sao Paulo firefighters department refused to sign off on its temporary seating, which led to Fifa recalling a number of sold tickets. Fans that acquired seats in that part of the stadium were forced to exchange their purchased seats for those situated in other areas of the stadium, causing the capacity to fall from around 68,000 to little over 60,000.	sports

Spain v Holland: We want revenge against Spain, says Wesley Sneijder - Telegraph	“It felt very sour. That will always be my rock bottom. “We were so close to penalties and that game was still there, but Iniesta scored just three minutes before the end of the extra time. “It was a shame because we had beaten Brazil in the quarter-final, a night when we turned the whole game. “I scored twice. Two goals, one with my head, and a 1-0 deficit turned into a place in the semi-finals. “You just felt at one point that we were going to win. And then the final against Spain just went wrong.” Spain go into Friday’s fixture as favourites, with Van Gaal’s blend of experience and emerging youngsters expected to face a battle with Chile for the runners-up spot - and a potential second round clash with Brazil. Sneijder insists, however, that Holland can get the positive result they need against Spain to avoid a losing start to the tournament. “This is a big week but it's only one game,” Sneijder said. “We need a result against Spain. That’s the point. “We may not have a top team, but we definitely have a chance to fight hard and we play compact and can switch the ball quickly. We have a chance.” With Guus Hiddink due to replace Manchester United-bound Van Gaal as coach following theWorld Cup, the Dutch team is expected to be rebuilt ahead of Euro 2016 in France. But Sneijder insists he is ready to prove in Brazil his ability to extend his international career to the next World Cup in Russia in 2018. “I’m very proud of my international career,” Sneijder said. “I’m not a captain, but still a leader. “The team spirit is good, much better than two years ago (at Euro 2012) and I will do everything to keep it that way because that is important at a major tournament. I know that from experience. “These are my sixth major finals but I will keep going. You will see me in four years.” Dutch winger Arjen Robben, whose training ground clash with defender Bruno Martins Indi earlier this week hinted at tensions within the squad, echoed Sneijder’s claims that Holland will test Spain by backing Van Gaal’s youngsters to impress in Salvador. “We have a young team, but it is talented,” Robben told Fifa.com. “Experience is important, especially mentally. But on the pitch it is all about playing in the right way, doing what you have to do - and it doesn’t matter if you are 22 or 32. You just have to do what is asked for. “That said, in my opinion Brazil, Argentina, Spain and Germany are the favourites. It will be hard for us because we have to play a very tough group. “Spain are the reigning world and European champions, and two teams from Spain played this season’s Champions League final. That says it all. “Chile also have a very strong team with really good players who want to play in an attacking way. “And Australia are physically strong. We have played a few matches against them and were never able to win. “But our preparations have been going well so far and I’m really happy we are in Brazil now. You can feel the tournament is about to start. “Brazil is one of the greatest football countries in the world - maybe the greatest - so it is fantastic the World Cup has been organised here.”	sports
Croatia star Ivan Rakitic excited by 'dream' Barcelona switch - Goal.com	The Croatia international has expressed his delight as he edges closer to completing a move to Camp Nou from the Europa League winners Sevilla midfielder Ivan Rakitic is revelling in a "dream come true" as he looks set to seal a switch to La Liga giants Barcelona. The 26-year-old is expected to move to Camp Nou after he has represented Croatia at the World Cup, with his performances during Sevilla's Europa League victory last season having caught the eye of several of Europe's biggest clubs. And Rakitic is thrilled to be on the verge of a move to the Catalan outfit, who are looking to rebuild their squad after missing out on the Liga, Champions League and Copa del Rey trophies last season. "I am very happy," Rakitic told Catalan newspaper Sport. "It is a dream come true." Barcelona are believed to have agreed a deal in the region of €20 million for the Croatia international. Rakitic's arrival is expected to hasten the departure of Cesc Fabregas, with Premier League sides Chelsea,  Manchester Unitedand Manchester City all linked with the Spain midfielder's signature. Barcelona appointed Luis Enrique as head coach last month after parting company with Gerardo Martino, who lasted just one season at the helm.	sports

The Dutch lost 1-0 to Spain thanks to an extra-time Andres Iniesta goal at Soccer City in Johannesburg four years ago, after Robben missed what proved to be a pivotal one-on-one with Iker Casillas on the hour mark. But the 30-year-old says he has no regrets and can’t wait for this weekend's big kick-off in Brazil. "A World Cup is always something special and I am very excited to be in Brazil for this one," he told Fifa.com. "South Africa was a really great tournament for me. It was obviously a big disappointment we lost the final, but I am still really proud of what we all achieved together at that tournament." The former Chelsea and Real Madrid star went on to say he was confident a young Dutch team can perform at the tournament, but conceded they are not among the favourites. "Experience is important, especially mentally. But on the pitch it is all about playing in the right way, doing what you have to do - and it doesn’t matter if you are 22 or 32.

World Cup 2014: Sepp Blatter’s big idea: let managers put referees on the spot - Telegraph	That brought a smattering of applause, but not from members of Uefa, who queued up on Tuesday to tell Blatter to stand down. The revolt, led in part by Football Association chairman Greg Dyke, was branded by Blatter as “the most disrespectful thing I’ve experienced in my entire life”. Yet, it will not stop him clinging on to power, which he could do indefinitely after member associations voted against the principle of term limits being introduced for presidents and other executives. As well as calling for greater use of technology, Blatter even floated the idea of Fifa taking football to other planets. With not a whiff of irony considering the storm over its decision to award the 2022 tournament to Qatar, the Swiss said: “We shall wonder if one day our game is played on another planet? Why not? Then we will have not only a World Cup we will have interplanetary competitions.” The Qatar vote is being looked into by Fifa’s chief investigator, who on Wednesday night vowed to examine evidence published by the British media in recent weeks before filing his report into allegations of corruption surrounding the 2010 vote. As revealed by Telegraph Sport on Wednesday, Michael J Garcia has asked The Sunday Times to provide him with the documents it obtained, which purportedly relate to Fifa’s controversial decision to hand the tournament to the Gulf State. Blatter this week claimed the investigations spearheaded by the Telegraph as being motivated by “racism”, an outburst that saw him taken to task by Dyke. Garcia promised to take them seriously, despite concluding his own inquiries on Monday. The American said: “What we can do, and what we have done, including in response to recent reports, is request any materials others have that they believe would assist in our inquiry.” Insisting he would produce a “comprehensive” report – expected late next month – he added: “What we cannot do and what I will not do is postpone indefinitely completing our work on the possibility someone may publish something we may not have seen.” The head of the investigatory chamber of Fifa’s ethics committee also warned that anyone who failed to cooperate with his investigation faced punishment. That could spell trouble for former executive committee member Franz Beckenbauer, the Germany legend who voted in 2010 but refused to meet with Garcia. The barrage of criticism aimed at Fifa over what Blatter dubbed “Qatartgate” continued on Wednesday when former FA chairman Lord Triesman accused it of acting like a “mafia family”. Triesman, the initial chairman of England’s doomed bid to host the 2018 World Cup who previously claimed four Fifa members sought bribes in return for votes said: “Fifa, I’m afraid, behaves like a mafia family.” He added of Blatter’s racism accusations: “Don Corleone, I believe, would have recognised the tactics and he probably would have admired them.” More accusations of “racism” were levelled at the British media at congress on Wednesday by the head of the Congolese FA. There was also some shameless plugging of Fifa’s €23 million motion picture, United Passions, while Fifa announced plans to pay out £120 million in total bonuses to its national associations and confederations from its World Cup revenue of an estimated £2.7 billion. Each of the 209 member countries will get £150,000 this month and should receive a further £300,000 early next year. The six continental bodies will get £1.5 million this month and should receive £2.7 million more next year.	sports

World Cup 2014: Prepare for joyous, nerve-shredding, ludicrous drama as Brazil's carnival begins - Telegraph	This is a World Cup that cannot shimmy around the problems of Brazilian life and society but still strives for what Socrates called “the ludicrous and joyous” drama of football between nations, watched by the world, in a narrative as broad and strong as the Amazon, which England will fly along to face Italy in Manaus on Saturday. Brazil are threatened on all sides by rich European countries who plunder their best players as well as their old enemy to the south, Argentina, plus the former colonial master – Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal. Ronaldo showed no sign of injury in Portugal’s 5-1 friendly win over the Republic of Ireland, and is now said to be billeted in a VIP suite where he can contemplate his private battle against Lionel Messi, whose vomiting problem has been the source of much curiosity. Messi, now 26, doubled-up again shortly after coming on in Argentina’s last warm-up match and has thrown-up half a dozen times for club and country. “Nerves,” says Argentina’s coach Alejandro Sabella, whose forward line is the most potent at this World Cup. “I reckon that in these moments there is anxiety more than anything. It’s difficult to remain calm.” The Ronaldo-Messi struggle for supremacy was not meant to be described in such malodorous terms, but at least Messi’s nausea tells us that today’s one-man corporations still care about their work. Neymar, who now wears the sacred No 10 for Brazil, has these two to cope with on top of his country’s expectations. Wayne Rooney, who was once compared to Pele by Sven-Goran Eriksson in one of his giddier moments, is another with a sword of judgment poised over his head. In two World Cups, Messi has scored only once, in a 6-0 win over Serbia in 2006, and the heat is on him to convert brilliance at Barcelona into something resembling Diego Maradona’s majesty with Argentina. He is not without accomplices in this cross-border raid. Across the forward line Sabella can call on Gonzalo Higuaín, Sergio Agüero, Ezequiel Lavezzi and Ángel Di Maria, none of which is good news for Bosnia (the debutants), Iran or Nigeria, who make up Group F. These are not the only A-list strikers, but some are struggling for fitness as their opening games approach. Uruguay’s Luis Suárez and Spain’s Diego Costa are among those walking the fine line between recovery and further breakdown. Suárez, the Premier League’s player of the year, underwent arthroscopic surgery on May 22 and trained on his own on Tuesday. Costa, from Lagarto in Brazil, was granted Spanish citizenship last year and could be in for a lively reception from the home crowds. The day before England play Italy on a pitch that looks in photographs like a jungle landing strip, the world and European champions Spain stage a rematch of the 2010 'karate’ final in Johannesburg, which Spain won at the expense of Holland, managed by Manchester United’s autocrat in waiting, Louis van Gaal. Spain hunt a double double. They captured the 2008 and 2012 European Championships either side of their World Cup victory in South Africa, from which 16 members of the squad survive. Spain are foremost among those teams hoping to overturn the reality that all South American World Cups have been won by South American teams. Spain’s dominance of world football can be seen as a victory over the Brazilian talent production machine, to the extent that Scolari’s men all spoke of a huge psychological boost with their Confederations Cup win over Vicente del Bosque’s team here last summer. Even Pele’s country had fallen prey to the notion of Spanish invincibility. Now this tournament offers a chance to restore their No 1 position after a six-year pageant of tiki‑taka-based play. This opening fixture is a chance to take almost sadistic pleasure in the sight of 23 footballers in the beautiful buttercup shirts of their land carry the hopes of 200 million Brazilians, with Neymar the dream catcher in chief. Carlos Alberto Parreira, coach of the 1994‑winning team in America, told reporters that the 22-year-old Neymar’s status as Brazil’s to craque (star) has piled pressure on the team’s poster boy. “A craque can make a difference from one move to another, but it’s the team that wins,” said Parreira, who is now Brazil’s technical director. “Like Maradona, Romario, Pele and all the players who made stand-out World Cup performances, he’ll win with a team behind him.” No host team meanwhile have ever lost an opening match. Brazil lift the World Cup curtain for the first time since their 2-1 win over Scotland at the Stade de France in 1998 and are closing in on La Hexa (a sixth win), two years before the 2016 Olympics drop another spaceship on the Brazilian economy, already reeling from the likely $12 billion cost of staging this event. This week the Brazilian business magazine Isto E Dinheiro called Scolari the “chief executive of the sixth world title”, as if this World Cup were a commercial takeover rather than a hard-fought competition. Before the ball rolls off the centre circle at the mostly-finished stadium in Sao Paulo, Brazil is trapped between the old sense of entitlement and a blazing urge to reject Fifa and its own government’s extravagance. “This is the strangest atmosphere I’ve ever witnessed in Brazil before a World Cup, as apprehension and apathy threaten the normal excitement,” the historian Antonio Risério told The New York Times, who also reported that only 34 per cent of Brazilians think the economy will be improved by the four-week party. Arnaldo Bloch, a columnist with O Globo, wrote: “That talk about the national team being the patrimony of Brazil, the affirmation of our identity and civility and cordiality – no one swallows that anymore.” But football is an opiate that usually finds a route round the body. As the marvellous Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano observed of the old culture: “Brazil has the most beautiful game in the world, made of hip feints, undulations of the torso and legs in flight, all of which came from capoeira, the warrior dance of black slaves, and from the joyful dances of big city slums. There are no right angles in Brazilian football, just as there are none in the Rio mountains.” Who will not look for surviving evidence of this culture when Thiago Silva leads the hosts up the tunnel here in Sao Paulo? However England fare against Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica, English viewers will have little difficulty identifying with Scolari’s outfit. A former Chelsea manager himself, he summoned six Premier League players, as well as Julio Cesar, the goalkeeper recently at Queens Park Rangers. David Luiz, Oscar, Ramires and Willian from Chelsea join Manchester City’s Fernandinho and Paulinho of Spurs in Brazil’s 23-man home guard. This pattern is repeated across the tournament, where 110 Premier League players will represent 26 of the 32 countries. Only Burnley and West Ham United from England’s top flight are without a single player in Brazil. Chelsea lead the way with 17. Beaten in the last World Cup quarter-finals by France (2006) and Holland (2010), Brazil seek their first win since 2002 in Yokohama, when the three Rs of Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho overwhelmed a Germany side now under intense pressure to convert promise into hard metal. Ronaldo’s goalscoring record is under threat from Germany’s Miroslav Klose, a functional finisher by comparison, who needs one more to match the Brazilian Ronaldo’s 15. Others edge towards landmarks. Span’s Iker Casillas has kept seven clean sheets in 15 World Cup finals matches and is three shy of the record of 10 held by Peter Shilton and Fabien Barthez. With one more blockade, Casillas will also pass Walter Zenga’s 1990 record of 517 minutes unbeaten. Algeria seek to avoid a place in history rather than grab one. Failure to score against Belgium in Belo Horizonte would render them the first country to go six successive World Cup games without a goal. At the other end of the glamour scale, Jürgen Klinsmann (the US coach) and Didier Deschamps (France) endeavour to join Brazil’s Mario Zagallo and Germany’s Franz Beckenbauer as the only men to have won World Cups as a player and a manager. Only Vittori Pozzo has won two trophies as a coach (with Italy in 1934 and 1938). Scolari or Del Bosque could take equal rank in the final in Rio de Janeiro on July 13. Despite all their talent and player development system, Germany have not won a trophy since Euro 96 in England. They were runners-up at Euro 2008 and third in the 2006 and 2010 World Cups. At Euro 2012 they were undone by Italy and Mario Balotelli in a game that was seen by many as a near-formality for the Nationalmannschaft. Five days before their game with Portugal in Salvador, Germany were embroiled in a row with 11 locals in the Santo Andre community over excessive security near their base. “We had wanted to ride by bike to our training ground everyday, but unfortunately this is not possible, because the police don’t allow it,” Oliver Bierhoff, Germany’s team manager, complained. The numbers say that in World Cup history 76 teams have played 772 games involving 6,598 players in 19 runnings of the event. This 20th staging lifts Brazil out of the sepia of 1950 and asks huge questions of the country’s infrastructure, government, economy and treatment of its own people, who have plenty of justifications for their grievances. Fifa announced on the eve of the opening ceremony that its 209 national member associations and six regional confederations will be paid bonuses totalling $200 million (£119 million) as revenue projections for Brazil 2014 shot up from $3.8 billion (£2.3 billion) to $4.5 billion (£2.7 billion). These hands‑outs are 40 per cent higher than in South Africa four years ago. Lord Triesman, the former Football Association chairman, alleged: “Fifa, I’m afraid, behaves like a mafia family. It has a decades-long tradition of bribes, bungs and corruption.” Brazil’s president Dilma Rousseff, tortured by the military junta in the early 1970s, portrayed her country as one striving for greater fairness. “I’m certain visitors will mix with a happy, generous and hospitable people, and be impressed by a nation full of natural beauty and which fights each day to become more equal,” she said. There are other kinds of fighting, too. In the first reported case of fan-on-fan violence, an Argentine supporter’s finger was broken when three Brazilians tried to rip a flag from his hands in Belo Horizonte. At a dream final of Argentina v Brazil just over four weeks from now, the chap with the broken finger can gain his revenge, especially if Messi can become the king of his continent ahead of Neymar. - Wayne Rooney: This time I have no excuses for failing to perform - Alan Hansen: Brazil were the best team I faced - I bared had a kick - Manaus groundsman: Pitch for England's game is in poor shape	sports

World Cup 2014: Sepp Blatter’s big idea: let managers put referees on the spot - Telegraph	That brought a smattering of applause, but not from members of Uefa, who queued up on Tuesday to tell Blatter to stand down. The revolt, led in part by Football Association chairman Greg Dyke, was branded by Blatter as “the most disrespectful thing I’ve experienced in my entire life”. Yet, it will not stop him clinging on to power, which he could do indefinitely after member associations voted against the principle of term limits being introduced for presidents and other executives. As well as calling for greater use of technology, Blatter even floated the idea of Fifa taking football to other planets. With not a whiff of irony considering the storm over its decision to award the 2022 tournament to Qatar, the Swiss said: “We shall wonder if one day our game is played on another planet? Why not? Then we will have not only a World Cup we will have interplanetary competitions.” The Qatar vote is being looked into by Fifa’s chief investigator, who on Wednesday night vowed to examine evidence published by the British media in recent weeks before filing his report into allegations of corruption surrounding the 2010 vote. As revealed by Telegraph Sport on Wednesday, Michael J Garcia has asked The Sunday Times to provide him with the documents it obtained, which purportedly relate to Fifa’s controversial decision to hand the tournament to the Gulf State. Blatter this week claimed the investigations spearheaded by the Telegraph as being motivated by “racism”, an outburst that saw him taken to task by Dyke. Garcia promised to take them seriously, despite concluding his own inquiries on Monday. The American said: “What we can do, and what we have done, including in response to recent reports, is request any materials others have that they believe would assist in our inquiry.” Insisting he would produce a “comprehensive” report – expected late next month – he added: “What we cannot do and what I will not do is postpone indefinitely completing our work on the possibility someone may publish something we may not have seen.” The head of the investigatory chamber of Fifa’s ethics committee also warned that anyone who failed to cooperate with his investigation faced punishment. That could spell trouble for former executive committee member Franz Beckenbauer, the Germany legend who voted in 2010 but refused to meet with Garcia. The barrage of criticism aimed at Fifa over what Blatter dubbed “Qatartgate” continued on Wednesday when former FA chairman Lord Triesman accused it of acting like a “mafia family”. Triesman, the initial chairman of England’s doomed bid to host the 2018 World Cup who previously claimed four Fifa members sought bribes in return for votes said: “Fifa, I’m afraid, behaves like a mafia family.” He added of Blatter’s racism accusations: “Don Corleone, I believe, would have recognised the tactics and he probably would have admired them.” More accusations of “racism” were levelled at the British media at congress on Wednesday by the head of the Congolese FA. There was also some shameless plugging of Fifa’s €23 million motion picture, United Passions, while Fifa announced plans to pay out £120 million in total bonuses to its national associations and confederations from its World Cup revenue of an estimated £2.7 billion. Each of the 209 member countries will get £150,000 this month and should receive a further £300,000 early next year. The six continental bodies will get £1.5 million this month and should receive £2.7 million more next year.	sports
Rooney: I have massive role to play for England - Goal.com	The Manchester United star's place in Roy Hodgson's starting XI has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks but he remains adamant he can be integral to the team By Greg Stobart in Rio de Janeiro Wayne Rooney insists he still has a "massive" role to play in an England squad he considers the best he has played in. The Manchester United striker has found his place in the side under scrutiny ahead of Saturday’s World Cup opener against Italy in Manaus, particularly after he was criticised by former team-mate Paul Scholes. Rooney has never scored in eight World Cup appearances but is adamant that he can lead England’s attack in Brazil this summer as an integral part of Roy Hodgson’s youthful squad. “The future is bright, there’s so much ability in the team,” Rooney said in a press conference at England’s training base in Urca. “The younger players are bringing a lot of energy and excitement to the team. It’s probably the best squad I’ve been a part of with England. “It’s a joy to be a part of. I still feel I have a massive role to play in the team.” Rooney revealed that team-mate Danny Welbeck will be fit to face Italy on Satuday despite missing training on Wednesday with a thigh problem sustained on Tuesday. And the 28-year-old reckons Italy should be worried about stopping England in the Amazon jungle, despite the Three Lions’ quarter-finals defeat to the Azzurri on penalties at Euro 2012. “Danny [Welbeck] will be fine, I’m sure he will be ready for Saturday. He’s just not risked anything today. “Italy should be thinking about how to control our team. They have good players but so do we. They should worry about us. “The target is to try and win the tournament. That’s what we’ve prepared to do. It’s obviously a different set up to 2006 and 2010 but the goal is the same, which is to win it.”	sports
Mesut Ozil says Germany want to win World Cup for Joachim Low - Goal.com	The Arsenal midfielder says claiming the trophy would be a fitting tribute to a coach who has revolutionised the national team Germany midfielder Mezut Ozil says he is desperate to win the World Cup for coach Joachim Low. Germany have arrived in Brazil seeking their fourth world title and were handed a tough Group G draw featuring Portugal, Ghana and USA. The former Real Madrid man says he and his team-mates are desperate to claim the crown as a thank you to Low, who Ozil says has revolutionised the national team during his spell in charge. “He's introduced a totally new German national team - one that is really respected all over the world,” Ozil told the official Arsenal club website. “Wherever we go, I think opponents are reluctant to play us because we are very strong. If you look at the German team over the last couple of years, you can see that we have continuously played excellent football.” Low, 54, took charge of the side following World Cup 2006 and finished runners-up at Euro 2008 before making it to the semi-finals of both World Cup 2010 and Euro 2012. And Ozil is keen to go a step further in Brazil this month. “[Low] is one of the best in the world and we're happy to have him around the team. “I hope he will finally be rewarded because in the past we've lost in the semi-finals or final and to lose when you are so close is always sad.”	sports
World Cup 2014: Prepare for joyous, nerve-shredding, ludicrous drama as Brazil's carnival begins - Telegraph	This is a World Cup that cannot shimmy around the problems of Brazilian life and society but still strives for what Socrates called “the ludicrous and joyous” drama of football between nations, watched by the world, in a narrative as broad and strong as the Amazon, which England will fly along to face Italy in Manaus on Saturday. Brazil are threatened on all sides by rich European countries who plunder their best players as well as their old enemy to the south, Argentina, plus the former colonial master – Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal. Ronaldo showed no sign of injury in Portugal’s 5-1 friendly win over the Republic of Ireland, and is now said to be billeted in a VIP suite where he can contemplate his private battle against Lionel Messi, whose vomiting problem has been the source of much curiosity. Messi, now 26, doubled-up again shortly after coming on in Argentina’s last warm-up match and has thrown-up half a dozen times for club and country. “Nerves,” says Argentina’s coach Alejandro Sabella, whose forward line is the most potent at this World Cup. “I reckon that in these moments there is anxiety more than anything. It’s difficult to remain calm.” The Ronaldo-Messi struggle for supremacy was not meant to be described in such malodorous terms, but at least Messi’s nausea tells us that today’s one-man corporations still care about their work. Neymar, who now wears the sacred No 10 for Brazil, has these two to cope with on top of his country’s expectations. Wayne Rooney, who was once compared to Pele by Sven-Goran Eriksson in one of his giddier moments, is another with a sword of judgment poised over his head. In two World Cups, Messi has scored only once, in a 6-0 win over Serbia in 2006, and the heat is on him to convert brilliance at Barcelona into something resembling Diego Maradona’s majesty with Argentina. He is not without accomplices in this cross-border raid. Across the forward line Sabella can call on Gonzalo Higuaín, Sergio Agüero, Ezequiel Lavezzi and Ángel Di Maria, none of which is good news for Bosnia (the debutants), Iran or Nigeria, who make up Group F. These are not the only A-list strikers, but some are struggling for fitness as their opening games approach. Uruguay’s Luis Suárez and Spain’s Diego Costa are among those walking the fine line between recovery and further breakdown. Suárez, the Premier League’s player of the year, underwent arthroscopic surgery on May 22 and trained on his own on Tuesday. Costa, from Lagarto in Brazil, was granted Spanish citizenship last year and could be in for a lively reception from the home crowds. The day before England play Italy on a pitch that looks in photographs like a jungle landing strip, the world and European champions Spain stage a rematch of the 2010 'karate’ final in Johannesburg, which Spain won at the expense of Holland, managed by Manchester United’s autocrat in waiting, Louis van Gaal. Spain hunt a double double. They captured the 2008 and 2012 European Championships either side of their World Cup victory in South Africa, from which 16 members of the squad survive. Spain are foremost among those teams hoping to overturn the reality that all South American World Cups have been won by South American teams. Spain’s dominance of world football can be seen as a victory over the Brazilian talent production machine, to the extent that Scolari’s men all spoke of a huge psychological boost with their Confederations Cup win over Vicente del Bosque’s team here last summer. Even Pele’s country had fallen prey to the notion of Spanish invincibility. Now this tournament offers a chance to restore their No 1 position after a six-year pageant of tiki‑taka-based play. This opening fixture is a chance to take almost sadistic pleasure in the sight of 23 footballers in the beautiful buttercup shirts of their land carry the hopes of 200 million Brazilians, with Neymar the dream catcher in chief. Carlos Alberto Parreira, coach of the 1994‑winning team in America, told reporters that the 22-year-old Neymar’s status as Brazil’s to craque (star) has piled pressure on the team’s poster boy. “A craque can make a difference from one move to another, but it’s the team that wins,” said Parreira, who is now Brazil’s technical director. “Like Maradona, Romario, Pele and all the players who made stand-out World Cup performances, he’ll win with a team behind him.” No host team meanwhile have ever lost an opening match. Brazil lift the World Cup curtain for the first time since their 2-1 win over Scotland at the Stade de France in 1998 and are closing in on La Hexa (a sixth win), two years before the 2016 Olympics drop another spaceship on the Brazilian economy, already reeling from the likely $12 billion cost of staging this event. This week the Brazilian business magazine Isto E Dinheiro called Scolari the “chief executive of the sixth world title”, as if this World Cup were a commercial takeover rather than a hard-fought competition. Before the ball rolls off the centre circle at the mostly-finished stadium in Sao Paulo, Brazil is trapped between the old sense of entitlement and a blazing urge to reject Fifa and its own government’s extravagance. “This is the strangest atmosphere I’ve ever witnessed in Brazil before a World Cup, as apprehension and apathy threaten the normal excitement,” the historian Antonio Risério told The New York Times, who also reported that only 34 per cent of Brazilians think the economy will be improved by the four-week party. Arnaldo Bloch, a columnist with O Globo, wrote: “That talk about the national team being the patrimony of Brazil, the affirmation of our identity and civility and cordiality – no one swallows that anymore.” But football is an opiate that usually finds a route round the body. As the marvellous Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano observed of the old culture: “Brazil has the most beautiful game in the world, made of hip feints, undulations of the torso and legs in flight, all of which came from capoeira, the warrior dance of black slaves, and from the joyful dances of big city slums. There are no right angles in Brazilian football, just as there are none in the Rio mountains.” Who will not look for surviving evidence of this culture when Thiago Silva leads the hosts up the tunnel here in Sao Paulo? However England fare against Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica, English viewers will have little difficulty identifying with Scolari’s outfit. A former Chelsea manager himself, he summoned six Premier League players, as well as Julio Cesar, the goalkeeper recently at Queens Park Rangers. David Luiz, Oscar, Ramires and Willian from Chelsea join Manchester City’s Fernandinho and Paulinho of Spurs in Brazil’s 23-man home guard. This pattern is repeated across the tournament, where 110 Premier League players will represent 26 of the 32 countries. Only Burnley and West Ham United from England’s top flight are without a single player in Brazil. Chelsea lead the way with 17. Beaten in the last World Cup quarter-finals by France (2006) and Holland (2010), Brazil seek their first win since 2002 in Yokohama, when the three Rs of Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho overwhelmed a Germany side now under intense pressure to convert promise into hard metal. Ronaldo’s goalscoring record is under threat from Germany’s Miroslav Klose, a functional finisher by comparison, who needs one more to match the Brazilian Ronaldo’s 15. Others edge towards landmarks. Span’s Iker Casillas has kept seven clean sheets in 15 World Cup finals matches and is three shy of the record of 10 held by Peter Shilton and Fabien Barthez. With one more blockade, Casillas will also pass Walter Zenga’s 1990 record of 517 minutes unbeaten. Algeria seek to avoid a place in history rather than grab one. Failure to score against Belgium in Belo Horizonte would render them the first country to go six successive World Cup games without a goal. At the other end of the glamour scale, Jürgen Klinsmann (the US coach) and Didier Deschamps (France) endeavour to join Brazil’s Mario Zagallo and Germany’s Franz Beckenbauer as the only men to have won World Cups as a player and a manager. Only Vittori Pozzo has won two trophies as a coach (with Italy in 1934 and 1938). Scolari or Del Bosque could take equal rank in the final in Rio de Janeiro on July 13. Despite all their talent and player development system, Germany have not won a trophy since Euro 96 in England. They were runners-up at Euro 2008 and third in the 2006 and 2010 World Cups. At Euro 2012 they were undone by Italy and Mario Balotelli in a game that was seen by many as a near-formality for the Nationalmannschaft. Five days before their game with Portugal in Salvador, Germany were embroiled in a row with 11 locals in the Santo Andre community over excessive security near their base. “We had wanted to ride by bike to our training ground everyday, but unfortunately this is not possible, because the police don’t allow it,” Oliver Bierhoff, Germany’s team manager, complained. The numbers say that in World Cup history 76 teams have played 772 games involving 6,598 players in 19 runnings of the event. This 20th staging lifts Brazil out of the sepia of 1950 and asks huge questions of the country’s infrastructure, government, economy and treatment of its own people, who have plenty of justifications for their grievances. Fifa announced on the eve of the opening ceremony that its 209 national member associations and six regional confederations will be paid bonuses totalling $200 million (£119 million) as revenue projections for Brazil 2014 shot up from $3.8 billion (£2.3 billion) to $4.5 billion (£2.7 billion). These hands‑outs are 40 per cent higher than in South Africa four years ago. Lord Triesman, the former Football Association chairman, alleged: “Fifa, I’m afraid, behaves like a mafia family. It has a decades-long tradition of bribes, bungs and corruption.” Brazil’s president Dilma Rousseff, tortured by the military junta in the early 1970s, portrayed her country as one striving for greater fairness. “I’m certain visitors will mix with a happy, generous and hospitable people, and be impressed by a nation full of natural beauty and which fights each day to become more equal,” she said. There are other kinds of fighting, too. In the first reported case of fan-on-fan violence, an Argentine supporter’s finger was broken when three Brazilians tried to rip a flag from his hands in Belo Horizonte. At a dream final of Argentina v Brazil just over four weeks from now, the chap with the broken finger can gain his revenge, especially if Messi can become the king of his continent ahead of Neymar. - Wayne Rooney: This time I have no excuses for failing to perform - Alan Hansen: Brazil were the best team I faced - I bared had a kick - Manaus groundsman: Pitch for England's game is in poor shape	sports
Manuel Neuer fit for Germany's World Cup opener with Portugal - Goal.com	The Bayern Munich shot stopper has been struggling with a shoulder injury but the goalkeeper coach insists he is fully fit to feature on Monday Manuel Neuer will be fit for Germany's World Cup opener with Portugal, according to goalkeeper coach Andreas Kopke. The Bayern Munich keeper has been struggling with a shoulder injury in recent weeks, but Kopke has allayed any fears that he will miss their Group G fixture on Monday, June 16. "Manuel's going to train fully today so that he can get a feel for his shoulder," Kopke said. "Things are going in the right direction for him. Manuel is experienced enough and we're constantly discussing how his shoulder feels. "It's not the case that he doesn't have faith in it. Manuel is fully fit." Neuer's understudy Roman Weidenfeller played in Germany's last two warm-up games - a 2-2 draw with Cameron and a 6-1 thrashing of Armenia - and Kopke insists there is no problem between the two keepers as they battle it out for the number one jersey. "You've got to have a great team spirit," he said. "Roman has said himself that there is no point in arguing about who should be number one. "He would be ready to play at any time, but he knows the overall situation. The players are pushing each other to greater things with their performances."	sports

With the greatest respect to Bryan, Trevor, Bob and Duncan from BDO [Hearts’ administrators], we are all delighted to see them go! “On a serious note, however, we owe them a huge thank-you for putting in the hours to get us out of administration this week, as promised. “So what now?

Should Hibs move for Murray they will have to pay Dumbarton – whom he steered to fifth place in last season’s Championship, despite sparse resources – compensation for the two-year deal he agreed in May. Murray, who took over in 2012 and led Dumbarton to seventh place the following season, was linked with the St Mirren vacancy when Danny Lennon was sacked, but the Paisley board had already decided to appoint Lennon’s assistant, Tommy Craig. When he signed his new deal with Dumbarton, Murray said: “I’m glad everything’s been sorted and we can get into the planning process for an exciting campaign next season.” However, with two spells as a Hibs player on his CV, it was inevitable that Murray’s name would be touted as a possible successor to Butcher, and one that would be popular with many fans.	sports
Italy playmaker Andrea Pirlo confident ahead of England World Cup 2014 clash - Telegraph	It is little wonder, then, that there is talk of Hodgson specifically adapting his formation to deal with the unique threat of a playmaker who operates so far behind the main striker. Pirlo is confident that the Italian midfield will simply use their movement to ensure that any man-marking strategy would be doomed to failure. Italy tested out a 4-1-3-1-1 formation during their training session on Wednesday and have been constantly tweaking their system during the build-up matches. Daniele De Rossi and Marco Verratti are expected to start but the one certainty is that manager Cesare Prandelli will give Pirlo the freedom to influence the game however he sees fit. “We tried this new solution with a midfielder in front of the defence and two further forward with more freedom,” said Pirlo. “We aim to rotate the midfield positions to keep our opponents guessing. "We like this option, it can give great results and we are working to improve every day. We can try many different approaches but it is also down to how you interpret the role. In truth it’s a system that involves rotation, as we go forward and at other times I’d come back into the more classic position.” Italy’s form in the warm-up matches will have prompted few alarm bells with England. True, they found their goalscoring touch in dispatching Fluminense 5-3 on Sunday but were winless in six previously during a sequence that even included an embarrassing 1-1 draw with Luxembourg. Pirlo was part of the Italy team that won the 2006 World Cup and he is still adamant that a repeat is possible. He also dismissed questions about his own elite status and the suggestion that Italy had become dependent upon him. “I was never interested in being a world star,” he said. “I think about enjoying - you journalists make the world stars. No. We are 23 players at the disposal of the coach and know to go all the way we need a contribution from everyone, as we learned in 2006. “Can Italy win the World Cup? Of course. When I play, it is solely to win. I am never just content with getting through the round. We have a competitive squad and will give our all to achieve this objective. We have the chance to make this a World Cup to be remembered for all our lives. We have what it takes to go far. The important thing is to believe, sacrifice ourselves, work hard and the results can arrive.” That process begins on Saturday, with Pirlo hinting that he could yet renege on a previous plan to retire from international football after this World Cup. At 35, his hunger to keep playing in club football was underlined on Wednesday by confirmation of a new two-year contract at Juventus. “I intend to quit international football after this World Cup but if I am needed...” said Pirlo. “I am still thinking of retiring, as I have a certain age and it’s only right to leave the field to the next generation coming through. It would be pointless to continue. “If I am needed, then there’s no problem in coming back. But if I come on international duty and don’t play, then I’d get angry. So it’s perhaps better I stay home.” It was a mercurial answer but typical of the one player who adds fantasy to an Italy team that still lack a certain flair. In his recent autobiography, Pirlo made a point of acknowledging how Juninho Pernambucano had inspired his free-kick technique and the former Brazil midfielder was even a guest on Wednesday at Casa Azzurri. “Pirlo is a demon, he not only copied my shot but improved it - if I was still playing I’d ask him to teach me,” said Juninho. Pirlo digested the compliment, gratefully accepted a Brazil shirt with his name on it and then delivered an even better sound-bite of his own. “Juninho was very kind to me, we were both emotional,” he said. “I’m Italian, but I’m also part Brazilian - Pirlinho, if you like.”	sports

Safet Susic's side go up against the South American giants in their opening match of Group F at the nation's first ever World Cup.  And despite the prospect of facing the likes of Lionel Messi and Sergio Aguero, playmaker Pjanic is confident that his country can give Argentina a run for their money. "We will be against one of the favourites in Argentina, but we have the expertise to challenge them," he told Sky Sport 24 . "We do not fear anyone because we believe in our chances.

World Cup 2014: Prepare for joyous, nerve-shredding, ludicrous drama as Brazil's carnival begins - Telegraph	This is a World Cup that cannot shimmy around the problems of Brazilian life and society but still strives for what Socrates called “the ludicrous and joyous” drama of football between nations, watched by the world, in a narrative as broad and strong as the Amazon, which England will fly along to face Italy in Manaus on Saturday. Brazil are threatened on all sides by rich European countries who plunder their best players as well as their old enemy to the south, Argentina, plus the former colonial master – Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal. Ronaldo showed no sign of injury in Portugal’s 5-1 friendly win over the Republic of Ireland, and is now said to be billeted in a VIP suite where he can contemplate his private battle against Lionel Messi, whose vomiting problem has been the source of much curiosity. Messi, now 26, doubled-up again shortly after coming on in Argentina’s last warm-up match and has thrown-up half a dozen times for club and country. “Nerves,” says Argentina’s coach Alejandro Sabella, whose forward line is the most potent at this World Cup. “I reckon that in these moments there is anxiety more than anything. It’s difficult to remain calm.” The Ronaldo-Messi struggle for supremacy was not meant to be described in such malodorous terms, but at least Messi’s nausea tells us that today’s one-man corporations still care about their work. Neymar, who now wears the sacred No 10 for Brazil, has these two to cope with on top of his country’s expectations. Wayne Rooney, who was once compared to Pele by Sven-Goran Eriksson in one of his giddier moments, is another with a sword of judgment poised over his head. In two World Cups, Messi has scored only once, in a 6-0 win over Serbia in 2006, and the heat is on him to convert brilliance at Barcelona into something resembling Diego Maradona’s majesty with Argentina. He is not without accomplices in this cross-border raid. Across the forward line Sabella can call on Gonzalo Higuaín, Sergio Agüero, Ezequiel Lavezzi and Ángel Di Maria, none of which is good news for Bosnia (the debutants), Iran or Nigeria, who make up Group F. These are not the only A-list strikers, but some are struggling for fitness as their opening games approach. Uruguay’s Luis Suárez and Spain’s Diego Costa are among those walking the fine line between recovery and further breakdown. Suárez, the Premier League’s player of the year, underwent arthroscopic surgery on May 22 and trained on his own on Tuesday. Costa, from Lagarto in Brazil, was granted Spanish citizenship last year and could be in for a lively reception from the home crowds. The day before England play Italy on a pitch that looks in photographs like a jungle landing strip, the world and European champions Spain stage a rematch of the 2010 'karate’ final in Johannesburg, which Spain won at the expense of Holland, managed by Manchester United’s autocrat in waiting, Louis van Gaal. Spain hunt a double double. They captured the 2008 and 2012 European Championships either side of their World Cup victory in South Africa, from which 16 members of the squad survive. Spain are foremost among those teams hoping to overturn the reality that all South American World Cups have been won by South American teams. Spain’s dominance of world football can be seen as a victory over the Brazilian talent production machine, to the extent that Scolari’s men all spoke of a huge psychological boost with their Confederations Cup win over Vicente del Bosque’s team here last summer. Even Pele’s country had fallen prey to the notion of Spanish invincibility. Now this tournament offers a chance to restore their No 1 position after a six-year pageant of tiki‑taka-based play. This opening fixture is a chance to take almost sadistic pleasure in the sight of 23 footballers in the beautiful buttercup shirts of their land carry the hopes of 200 million Brazilians, with Neymar the dream catcher in chief. Carlos Alberto Parreira, coach of the 1994‑winning team in America, told reporters that the 22-year-old Neymar’s status as Brazil’s to craque (star) has piled pressure on the team’s poster boy. “A craque can make a difference from one move to another, but it’s the team that wins,” said Parreira, who is now Brazil’s technical director. “Like Maradona, Romario, Pele and all the players who made stand-out World Cup performances, he’ll win with a team behind him.” No host team meanwhile have ever lost an opening match. Brazil lift the World Cup curtain for the first time since their 2-1 win over Scotland at the Stade de France in 1998 and are closing in on La Hexa (a sixth win), two years before the 2016 Olympics drop another spaceship on the Brazilian economy, already reeling from the likely $12 billion cost of staging this event. This week the Brazilian business magazine Isto E Dinheiro called Scolari the “chief executive of the sixth world title”, as if this World Cup were a commercial takeover rather than a hard-fought competition. Before the ball rolls off the centre circle at the mostly-finished stadium in Sao Paulo, Brazil is trapped between the old sense of entitlement and a blazing urge to reject Fifa and its own government’s extravagance. “This is the strangest atmosphere I’ve ever witnessed in Brazil before a World Cup, as apprehension and apathy threaten the normal excitement,” the historian Antonio Risério told The New York Times, who also reported that only 34 per cent of Brazilians think the economy will be improved by the four-week party. Arnaldo Bloch, a columnist with O Globo, wrote: “That talk about the national team being the patrimony of Brazil, the affirmation of our identity and civility and cordiality – no one swallows that anymore.” But football is an opiate that usually finds a route round the body. As the marvellous Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano observed of the old culture: “Brazil has the most beautiful game in the world, made of hip feints, undulations of the torso and legs in flight, all of which came from capoeira, the warrior dance of black slaves, and from the joyful dances of big city slums. There are no right angles in Brazilian football, just as there are none in the Rio mountains.” Who will not look for surviving evidence of this culture when Thiago Silva leads the hosts up the tunnel here in Sao Paulo? However England fare against Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica, English viewers will have little difficulty identifying with Scolari’s outfit. A former Chelsea manager himself, he summoned six Premier League players, as well as Julio Cesar, the goalkeeper recently at Queens Park Rangers. David Luiz, Oscar, Ramires and Willian from Chelsea join Manchester City’s Fernandinho and Paulinho of Spurs in Brazil’s 23-man home guard. This pattern is repeated across the tournament, where 110 Premier League players will represent 26 of the 32 countries. Only Burnley and West Ham United from England’s top flight are without a single player in Brazil. Chelsea lead the way with 17. Beaten in the last World Cup quarter-finals by France (2006) and Holland (2010), Brazil seek their first win since 2002 in Yokohama, when the three Rs of Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho overwhelmed a Germany side now under intense pressure to convert promise into hard metal. Ronaldo’s goalscoring record is under threat from Germany’s Miroslav Klose, a functional finisher by comparison, who needs one more to match the Brazilian Ronaldo’s 15. Others edge towards landmarks. Span’s Iker Casillas has kept seven clean sheets in 15 World Cup finals matches and is three shy of the record of 10 held by Peter Shilton and Fabien Barthez. With one more blockade, Casillas will also pass Walter Zenga’s 1990 record of 517 minutes unbeaten. Algeria seek to avoid a place in history rather than grab one. Failure to score against Belgium in Belo Horizonte would render them the first country to go six successive World Cup games without a goal. At the other end of the glamour scale, Jürgen Klinsmann (the US coach) and Didier Deschamps (France) endeavour to join Brazil’s Mario Zagallo and Germany’s Franz Beckenbauer as the only men to have won World Cups as a player and a manager. Only Vittori Pozzo has won two trophies as a coach (with Italy in 1934 and 1938). Scolari or Del Bosque could take equal rank in the final in Rio de Janeiro on July 13. Despite all their talent and player development system, Germany have not won a trophy since Euro 96 in England. They were runners-up at Euro 2008 and third in the 2006 and 2010 World Cups. At Euro 2012 they were undone by Italy and Mario Balotelli in a game that was seen by many as a near-formality for the Nationalmannschaft. Five days before their game with Portugal in Salvador, Germany were embroiled in a row with 11 locals in the Santo Andre community over excessive security near their base. “We had wanted to ride by bike to our training ground everyday, but unfortunately this is not possible, because the police don’t allow it,” Oliver Bierhoff, Germany’s team manager, complained. The numbers say that in World Cup history 76 teams have played 772 games involving 6,598 players in 19 runnings of the event. This 20th staging lifts Brazil out of the sepia of 1950 and asks huge questions of the country’s infrastructure, government, economy and treatment of its own people, who have plenty of justifications for their grievances. Fifa announced on the eve of the opening ceremony that its 209 national member associations and six regional confederations will be paid bonuses totalling $200 million (£119 million) as revenue projections for Brazil 2014 shot up from $3.8 billion (£2.3 billion) to $4.5 billion (£2.7 billion). These hands‑outs are 40 per cent higher than in South Africa four years ago. Lord Triesman, the former Football Association chairman, alleged: “Fifa, I’m afraid, behaves like a mafia family. It has a decades-long tradition of bribes, bungs and corruption.” Brazil’s president Dilma Rousseff, tortured by the military junta in the early 1970s, portrayed her country as one striving for greater fairness. “I’m certain visitors will mix with a happy, generous and hospitable people, and be impressed by a nation full of natural beauty and which fights each day to become more equal,” she said. There are other kinds of fighting, too. In the first reported case of fan-on-fan violence, an Argentine supporter’s finger was broken when three Brazilians tried to rip a flag from his hands in Belo Horizonte. At a dream final of Argentina v Brazil just over four weeks from now, the chap with the broken finger can gain his revenge, especially if Messi can become the king of his continent ahead of Neymar. - Wayne Rooney: This time I have no excuses for failing to perform - Alan Hansen: Brazil were the best team I faced - I bared had a kick - Manaus groundsman: Pitch for England's game is in poor shape	sports
VIDEO: Blatter dances his troubles away - Goal.com	Despite being faced with calls for him to resign, the 78-year-old Swiss took the time to show he still has authority on the dance floor alongside Fernanda Lima The build-up to the 2014 World Cup has been tough for Sepp Blatter, with allegations of corruption rocking Fifa and calls for the Swiss official to stand down amidst concerns over whether Brazil will even be ready for the opening fixtures of the tournament this week. When faced by the media just one day before the competition, however, the 78-year-old seemed decidedly unperturbed, taking time out of his schedule of handing out awards to showcase his dance moves with Brazilian beauty Fernanda Lima. Having also spoken of his desire to see football played in an "inter-platenary competition" in future, Blatter's moves in Brazil were hardly out of this world, but it certainly proved he is willing to embrace the part atmosphere of football's greatest showpiece...	sports
Spain v Holland: We want revenge against Spain, says Wesley Sneijder - Telegraph	“It felt very sour. That will always be my rock bottom. “We were so close to penalties and that game was still there, but Iniesta scored just three minutes before the end of the extra time. “It was a shame because we had beaten Brazil in the quarter-final, a night when we turned the whole game. “I scored twice. Two goals, one with my head, and a 1-0 deficit turned into a place in the semi-finals. “You just felt at one point that we were going to win. And then the final against Spain just went wrong.” Spain go into Friday’s fixture as favourites, with Van Gaal’s blend of experience and emerging youngsters expected to face a battle with Chile for the runners-up spot - and a potential second round clash with Brazil. Sneijder insists, however, that Holland can get the positive result they need against Spain to avoid a losing start to the tournament. “This is a big week but it's only one game,” Sneijder said. “We need a result against Spain. That’s the point. “We may not have a top team, but we definitely have a chance to fight hard and we play compact and can switch the ball quickly. We have a chance.” With Guus Hiddink due to replace Manchester United-bound Van Gaal as coach following theWorld Cup, the Dutch team is expected to be rebuilt ahead of Euro 2016 in France. But Sneijder insists he is ready to prove in Brazil his ability to extend his international career to the next World Cup in Russia in 2018. “I’m very proud of my international career,” Sneijder said. “I’m not a captain, but still a leader. “The team spirit is good, much better than two years ago (at Euro 2012) and I will do everything to keep it that way because that is important at a major tournament. I know that from experience. “These are my sixth major finals but I will keep going. You will see me in four years.” Dutch winger Arjen Robben, whose training ground clash with defender Bruno Martins Indi earlier this week hinted at tensions within the squad, echoed Sneijder’s claims that Holland will test Spain by backing Van Gaal’s youngsters to impress in Salvador. “We have a young team, but it is talented,” Robben told Fifa.com. “Experience is important, especially mentally. But on the pitch it is all about playing in the right way, doing what you have to do - and it doesn’t matter if you are 22 or 32. You just have to do what is asked for. “That said, in my opinion Brazil, Argentina, Spain and Germany are the favourites. It will be hard for us because we have to play a very tough group. “Spain are the reigning world and European champions, and two teams from Spain played this season’s Champions League final. That says it all. “Chile also have a very strong team with really good players who want to play in an attacking way. “And Australia are physically strong. We have played a few matches against them and were never able to win. “But our preparations have been going well so far and I’m really happy we are in Brazil now. You can feel the tournament is about to start. “Brazil is one of the greatest football countries in the world - maybe the greatest - so it is fantastic the World Cup has been organised here.”	sports
Hearts euphoric as club finally exit administration a year after insolvency - Telegraph	Local businesswoman, Ann Budge, who agreed a deal with creditors to buy the club and install Craig Levein as director of football and Robbie Neilson as head coach, used the Hearts website to address the support in excited terms, when she said: “By now, you will all have heard and, yes, it’s true, we have formally exited administration! “Everyone associated with the club is ecstatic and now we can really begin to move ahead in implementing our plans for the future. With the greatest respect to Bryan, Trevor, Bob and Duncan from BDO [Hearts’ administrators], we are all delighted to see them go! “On a serious note, however, we owe them a huge thank-you for putting in the hours to get us out of administration this week, as promised. “So what now? Well, the first thing is to get season tickets on sale as quickly as possible and the club will be issuing information regarding this tomorrow. “Following this, we will shortly be issuing information on new signings and more pre-season friendlies which, I know, is what all the fans are desperate to hear. “However, for today, let’s just celebrate the news!” Meanwhile, at Easter Road, the hunt for a replacement for Butcher has started, with Ian Murray favourite to get the job, despite speculation that the new Hibernian CEO, Leeann Dempster, would turn to Motherwell, the club she left to move to Edinburgh, in pursuit of Stuart McCall. Should Hibs move for Murray they will have to pay Dumbarton – whom he steered to fifth place in last season’s Championship, despite sparse resources – compensation for the two-year deal he agreed in May. Murray, who took over in 2012 and led Dumbarton to seventh place the following season, was linked with the St Mirren vacancy when Danny Lennon was sacked, but the Paisley board had already decided to appoint Lennon’s assistant, Tommy Craig. When he signed his new deal with Dumbarton, Murray said: “I’m glad everything’s been sorted and we can get into the planning process for an exciting campaign next season.” However, with two spells as a Hibs player on his CV, it was inevitable that Murray’s name would be touted as a possible successor to Butcher, and one that would be popular with many fans.	sports

Phil Jones feared for England World Cup place - Goal.com	The England defender took a heavy knock during Manchester United's 3-1 win over Hull in May but was included in Roy Hodgson's squad and is set to play in Brazil England defender Phil Jones has revealed that he feared for his World Cup prospects after injuring a shoulder at the end of last season. The 22-year-old sustained the injury in Manchester United's 3-1 win over Hull City last month, and it was initially feared he could be ruled out of the Brazilian showpiece. However, England boss Roy Hodgson included Jones in his 23-man squad and he played in the pre-tournament friendly against Ecuador last week. And the former Blackburn Rovers man has revealed he breathed a huge sigh of relief when he realised the injury was not going to prevent him from travelling to Brazil. "Once I did it (injured his shoulder) I thought I might not have a chance, but thankfully it healed quickly and I'm feeling fit, ready and I'm so looking forward to it," Jones told the FA's official website. "(The World Cup) was the first thing that came into my mind when I did it. "I remember getting the scan sitting there thinking 'it might knock my chance'. But, thankfully it's healed nicely and I'm able to be a part of what's going to hopefully be a successful tournament." Jones partnered club-mate Chris Smalling at the heart of England's defence in the 2-2 draw with Ecuador, and he was thrilled to get back on the pitch after a month out. "It was nice to get a start, it was a great game, competitive, it was what we wanted and it was great getting 90 minutes under my belt," he added. "It's been great, the lads were all really keen and excited to get out here and now we're here there's a real belief and buzz about the place. "It's building up to the first crucial game of the tournament. There has been an awful lot of work that has gone in behind the scenes which most people don't see. "Everyone is committed, we're in a tight group and everyone's pulling in the right direction for a successful campaign over here."	sports

Chelsea youngster Tomas Kalas joins Koln on loan - Goal.com	The Czech defender made two Premier League appearances for the Blues in 2013-14 but will continue his development at the newly-promoted Bundesliga club Chelsea defender Tomas Kalas will join newly promoted FC Koln on a season-long loan on July 1. The Czech, who has a solitary international cap to his name, spent two seasons on loan at Dutch outfit Vitesse Arnhem before returning to Stamford Bridge for the 2013-14 campaign. After being handed his Chelsea debut as a late substitute in a 2-0 League Cup win at Arsenal in October, Kalas made his European bow in a last-16 home triumph over Galatasaray. Kalas' first start for the club came in the huge 2-0 Premier League victory at Liverpool in April, and he was among the starting XI once again on the last day of the Premier League season at relegated Cardiff City.

Phil Jones feared for England World Cup place - Goal.com	The England defender took a heavy knock during Manchester United's 3-1 win over Hull in May but was included in Roy Hodgson's squad and is set to play in Brazil England defender Phil Jones has revealed that he feared for his World Cup prospects after injuring a shoulder at the end of last season. The 22-year-old sustained the injury in Manchester United's 3-1 win over Hull City last month, and it was initially feared he could be ruled out of the Brazilian showpiece. However, England boss Roy Hodgson included Jones in his 23-man squad and he played in the pre-tournament friendly against Ecuador last week. And the former Blackburn Rovers man has revealed he breathed a huge sigh of relief when he realised the injury was not going to prevent him from travelling to Brazil. "Once I did it (injured his shoulder) I thought I might not have a chance, but thankfully it healed quickly and I'm feeling fit, ready and I'm so looking forward to it," Jones told the FA's official website. "(The World Cup) was the first thing that came into my mind when I did it. "I remember getting the scan sitting there thinking 'it might knock my chance'. But, thankfully it's healed nicely and I'm able to be a part of what's going to hopefully be a successful tournament." Jones partnered club-mate Chris Smalling at the heart of England's defence in the 2-2 draw with Ecuador, and he was thrilled to get back on the pitch after a month out. "It was nice to get a start, it was a great game, competitive, it was what we wanted and it was great getting 90 minutes under my belt," he added. "It's been great, the lads were all really keen and excited to get out here and now we're here there's a real belief and buzz about the place. "It's building up to the first crucial game of the tournament. There has been an awful lot of work that has gone in behind the scenes which most people don't see. "Everyone is committed, we're in a tight group and everyone's pulling in the right direction for a successful campaign over here."	sports

David Luiz reveals five-year deal with PSG - Goal.com	The 27-year-old claims he has agreed to leave Chelsea and play for the French champions for five seasons following this month's World Cup in Brazil Brazil defender David Luiz has revealed he has signed a five-year deal with French champions Paris Saint-Germain. His current club, Chelsea, and PSG both released statements on their official websites last month confirming that a deal  - which Goal understands is worth €50 million - had been agreed. And now the 27-year-old, who is hoping to lead the Selecao to their sixth world title and their first on home soil, has confirmed he will be playing in Ligue 1 for the next five seasons. “I have just signed a deal with PSG for five years,” he told Globo when asked if he intends to one day play in Brazil’s top flight. “I left for Europe when I was 18, I skipped a few steps… We’ll see. What we plan today may not be right tomorrow.” The Selecao’s vice-captain also spoke of the demonstrations seen across the country in protest of public spending for the World Cup. “As long as the demonstrations happen peacefully, I respect them. I do not want to see violence,” he said. “I do not like the vision that Europeans have about our country, that Brazil is bad. Brazil has many things to be great.”	sports

Chelsea youngster Tomas Kalas joins Koln on loan - Goal.com	The Czech defender made two Premier League appearances for the Blues in 2013-14 but will continue his development at the newly-promoted Bundesliga club Chelsea defender Tomas Kalas will join newly promoted FC Koln on a season-long loan on July 1. The Czech, who has a solitary international cap to his name, spent two seasons on loan at Dutch outfit Vitesse Arnhem before returning to Stamford Bridge for the 2013-14 campaign. After being handed his Chelsea debut as a late substitute in a 2-0 League Cup win at Arsenal in October, Kalas made his European bow in a last-16 home triumph over Galatasaray. Kalas' first start for the club came in the huge 2-0 Premier League victory at Liverpool in April, and he was among the starting XI once again on the last day of the Premier League season at relegated Cardiff City. The 21-year-old will now be hoping to pick up more first-team experience as Koln adjust to life back in the Bundesliga, after topping the second tier last term. Kalas arrived at Chelsea from Sigma Olomouc in 2011.	sports

Fifa behaves like mafia family, says Lord Triesman - Goal.com	The former English Football Association chairman has compared the organisation's beleaguered leadership to the Corleone crime family depicted in the Godfather films Fifa behaves like a "mafia family" with a tradition of "bribes, bungs and corruption", according to former English Football Association chairman Lord Triesman. World football's governing body has been rocked by a series of scandals in recent years, most recently allegations published by The Sunday Times newspaper relating to impropriety in Qatar's successful bid to host the 2022 World Cup. Fifa's bullish response to the allegations has led several high-ranking Uefa delegates to call for president Sepp Blatter to step down after 16 years at the head of the organisation. And Triesman, who was FA chairman when England launched its failed bid to host the 2018 World Cup, has launched a scathing public attack on the Fifa leadership, likening it to the Corleone crime family depicted in the Godfather films. "Fifa, I’m afraid, behaves like a mafia family. It has a decades-long tradition of bribes, bungs and corruption," he said during a debate on the Queen's Speech in the House of Lords. "About half of its executive committee who voted on the last World Cup have had to go. "Even its past president Joao Havelange has been removed from his honorary life presidency in his 90s. "Systematic corruption underpinned by non-existent investigations where most of the accused are exempt from the investigation make it impossible to proceed. "Don Corleone, I believe, would have recognised the tactics and he probably would have admired them."	sports

Ghana face anxious wait on injured Abdul Majeed Waris - Goal.com	The striker suffered a torn thigh muscle in the friendly win over South Korea and is a doubt for the World Cup opener against USA on Monday Scans have revealed that Ghana striker Abdul Majeed Waris has a torn quadricep and faces a race against time to be fit for the World Cup. The injury was at first thought to be relatively minor, incurred during the fourth minute of Monday's 4-0 friendly victory over South Korea. "He had a knock on his left thigh," said team doctor Baba Adam. "We initially tried to see if he could go back to play but we realised it was an injury that needed to be taken care of and managed well. "We did an MRI on the quadriceps and what we realised is that, there was a tear. "We hope to get him on to the field again pretty soon. However, we are still monitoring him to the deadline when we will give our final statement on his state of affairs." Waris' absence would be a huge blow after the diminutive attacker played an integral part in Ghana's qualification for Brazil, during which he scored three goals. "The Fifa deadline is (June) 15, so we will monitor until that day and see how things turn up," said Adam before adding that Waris is improving and "can now bend his knee with little pain." Ghana begin their World Cup campaign against the United States on Monday before meeting Germany on June 21 and Portugal on June 26.	sports
Sepp Blatter: I want an interplanetary World Cup - Telegraph	Triesman, the initial chairman of England's doomed bid to host the 2018 World Cup, has previously claimed four Fifa members sought bribes in return for votes. In the light of recent media allegations of corruption in Qatar's successful bid for the 2022 World Cup, Triesman stepped up his attack on the governing body, claiming attempts by Blatter to dismiss the issue was a tactic that would have been approved by movie Godfather Don Corleone. "Fifa, I'm afraid, behaves like a mafia family. It has a decades-long tradition of bribes, bungs and corruption," he said. Speaking during a debate on the Queen's Speech in the House of Lords, Triesman applauded the stand taken by current FA chairman Greg Dyke against the "grotesque" accusation by Blatter that media investigations into corruption at Fifa were racist. He told peers: "Don Corleone, I believe, would have recognised the tactics and he probably would have admired them." Speaking on the eve of the World Cup in Brazil, Blatter also said Fifa must move forward in a changing world in which football had become a "multi-billion dollar" industry with "powerful opportunities". "Our world is changing, our game is changing. Our organisation must also change. It is our duty to keep football going forward. "It is our duty to lead by example and behave like an example, with integrity." Blatter said football's growth "creates powerful opportunities. Sometimes it creates controversial situations and then some difficulty".	sports
The Page That Worries It's In The Minority | Football365 | Mediawatch	Latest Articles Steve Bruce should be England manager because he was a good captain, England have let down Chile, Gary Lineker has done a massive about-turn and more... We made a bit of a boo-boo about Luis Suarez, Oliver Holt asks for a 'tweak' and then calls it a 'gamble' and Neil Ashton wants Hodgson out because he didn't pick James Milner... The Wrong Stuff Given its daily duty, Mediawatch grows adapted to reading the sort of pieces that may make less-accustomed readers fall off their chairs in surprise, anger, sadness or a merry mix of all three. However, the front page of this morning's The Sun contains a quote so entrenched in parody that even we failed to hide our shock. Strap yourselves in. 'The next young player who says he does not want to play for England should be ordered to ring the parents of a soldier who has died serving his country in Afghanistan and tell them his reasons,' is the quote in question from Ian Wright on the paper's FRONT page. Yes, really. A few questions, Ian: 1) Why on earth are you comparing playing football for your country with fighting and losing your life in a war? Football is a place in which priorities are skewed and importance inflated at the best of times, but even Wrighty must see that his equation is deeply flawed? Bill Shankly's memorable epithet regarding the game being "more than a matter of life and death" was intended as a pithy display of just how much football meant to him. It should not be used as a relevant moral compass. Football is not 'just a game', but that only refers to its growth as a commercial entity and potential vehicle for unity, rather than being equatable to the dangers of conflict. 2) What on earth would a player say to soldiers' families? "Hi, is that Mrs Moore?" "Good, I was just calling because I have been 'forced' to explain to you the reasons why I don't want to play in England's next friendly against Latvia" "Oh... Yes I suppose you're right, you probably have got better things to think about. It's just that a columnist in The Sun said..." "Yes, true. He probably was just trying to get a reaction. And you're right, the paper probably did put it on the front page just to sell copies, fully in the knowledge that it would generate a heated reaction. And yes, I guess that is actually quite demeaning to you and your loss. Sorry to have troubled you." 3) Why would these calls to families serve any purpose to either party? Wright's intention is to shame the apparent disrespect displayed by those not wanting to play for England, but in fact only demonstrates incredible insensitivity to the families of those killed in war. Mediawatch doesn't feel like it can or should speak on their behalf, but we're pretty sure that a fringe player choosing not to play for his country's football team fails to even flicker on the radar of those who have suffered such a tragic loss. Comparing those two scenarios only serves to demean such tragedy. Reading The Riot Act The Sun don't stop their campaign of cretinism there though. Oh no. 'Bookworm,' screams the headline on the back page of the paper. 'Dyke's 'Death in Brazil' Blunder,' reads the tagline. Oh goodness, has Football Association chairman Greg Dyke killed a man on Copacabana beach? No, he hasn't. Instead he has been 'caught' reading a book called 'Death in Brazil', a novel by Peter Robb that describes Brazil's multicultural history through the mediums of sex, food and death. It is, Mediawatch has been told, quite brilliant. This disgusting action on Dyke's part is labelled as a 'major blunder' and a 'PR disaster' by The Sun, who describe his decision to read Peter Robb's book as 'capping the end of a nightmare campaign for England.' Finally, the paper claim the incident is 'embarrassing'. Which of course it isn't. But using the back page spread of your paper to criticise a man for reading a book with a particular title is. It really, really is. Where's The Passion, Lads? Mediawatch completed its headache-inducing hat-trick in The Sun with Tony Parsons predictably calling for 'passion' in a piece that might as well be written in the blood of the dragon slayed by St. George. We know Parsons wants 'passion' because the word is in capital letters on the front page of the paper. It's also used in the byline to the piece. It's also capitalised and emboldened on three separate occasions in the piece itself. We've had quite enough of The Sun 's jingoistic bulls**t for one day, so will instead simply let you tick off your World Cup exit fall-out bingo card: 'Where was the fire in the belly?' - Check. 'Where was the blood of Terry Butcher' - Check. 'All guns blazing' - Check. 'Charge of the light brigade' - Check. 'Dunkirk' - Check. 'We could not fight our way out of a paper bag, let alone fight Nazi Germany. We would give Hitler a house and tell him to bring the family' - House. If this is what England wants, we don't want England. Someone pass Mediawatch its passport. Fix You 'Roy: We Need Six Years To Fix It,' farts out the claim on the back page of the Daily Mail. Connoisseurs will spot the lack of speech marks in the headline to a piece written by Neil Ashton. That's key here. Actual quotes from Roy Hodgson: "I'm now giving them the opportunity, not because I can, but because this is a good team and they can go and win the game. I hope they prove me right. "We just hope the next two, four to six years will bring some dividends from this. We are no longer capable of going through, but we're trying to build the confidence." Welcome to the Daily Mail's quote translator, where the England manager explaining the benefit of using young players against Costa Rica because it will give them experience for their future England careers becomes 'We Need Six Years To Fix It'. Why of course. Just Another 'Exclusive' 'EXCLUSIVE: Herrera WILL complete £28m move to United TODAY,' screams the headline on the Daily Mail website. Presumably, 'exclusive' is now short for 'well the Spanish media ran this last night but we've got it too so click here'? The Final Word Mediawatch greatly enjoyed Adrian Durham's list of '10 things the Three Lions boss MUST do ahead of Euro 2016' piece on the Daily Mail website, because there is nothing better than an experienced tactician and manager passing on his wisdom. The expert coach's big ideas include the following pieces of advice. See if you can spot the problem: 'Pick Daniel Sturridge and Rooney as a front pair' 'Flood the midfield by picking Michael Carrick, Jack Wilshere and Steven Gerrard' 'Right now I would suggest that Ross Barkley, Luke Shaw, John Stones and Raheem Sterling are good enough to start for England'. Yes, that's right. From now on England will be playing with Luke Shaw and John Stones as part of a three-man defence with no wing-backs. And you thought Roy Hodgson had been adventurous in Brazil. However, Mediawatch enjoyed no. 6 on Durham's list the most. 'Wilshere loves playing for England... so play him!' is Durham's logic. Yes, forget form, fitness or ability, it's who 'loves' it most that should get in the team. We presume Terry Butcher is the other choice for that three-man defence. 'Have I Just Read That?' Questions Of The Day 'How many fat East Europeans do you see? How many Chinese are on benefits? Where did it all go wrong' - Tony Parsons continues his charm offensive in The Sun. Optimistic Statement Of The Day 'There will be no angry mob, no mood to vilify them - just a general acceptance that we didn't expect much more anyway' - Dave Kidd in the Daily Mirror clearly hasn't read the tabloids over the last few days. For that he should be thankful. Headline Of The Day 'He's For Real' - Nice work from the Daily Mirror on Luis Suarez. Now we're all doing the Ali G voice in our head. Worst Headline Of The Day 'Loot Shaw' - He is going to cost an awful lot of money, but that doesn't excuse such weak punnery from the Daily Mirror. Non-Football Story Of The Day 'A man has had to be rescued by firefighters in Germany after becoming stuck inside a stone vagina. 'The man, who is said to be an American exchange student, got wedged in the statue at Tubingen University. 'According to German newspaper Schwäbisches Tagblatt, five emergency service vehicles and 22 firemen had to help free the man.

Is Anybody Still Defending This Lethal Weapon? | F365 Says	Surely there comes a point when even his greatest Liverpool-supporting defenders put their hands up and admit he's a tool. But he's a tool that they'll probably keep now... Last Updated: 24/06/14 at 20:28 Post Comment Latest Articles Some will demand inquests but is there anything fundamentally wrong with England or are they just a half-decent side who came up narrowly short? The truth is pretty dull... Having been urged to 'give youth a chance' and 'change the shape' before Brazil, Roy Hodgson did exactly that. It's difficult to vilify a man that did what we would do, says Philip Cornwall... It might have been a miserable week on Football365 but battered spirits have been raised by commenters on Monday's otherwise-anodyne gossip column suggesting that a swap deal involving Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi might see Liverpool getting the sticky end of the exchange. Seriously. I'd consider a straight swap, Messi for Suarez would be an acceptable gamble (and it would be a gamble - Messi's relatively poor form this season could be the beginnings of a decline) but I'd rather keep Suarez. Hopefully Suarez meant it when he said he doesn't want to leave and will come out and say it again after the World Cup. That was our favourite comment but there have been others - from those who refuse to believe that Suarez might want to leave Liverpool, just as they refused to believe that he might want to leave Liverpool last summer, refused to believe that he would use racist language and refused to believe that two biting incidents were anything other than coincidence. Now there's a third. As we are struggling to name more than a handful of footballers who have felt the need to sink their teeth into an opposition player once, surely even the Uruguayan's staunchest suppporters have to admit that three times offers pretty compelling evidence that they have been defending the indefensible. We have been told that he has redeemed himself this season by a) scoring a lot of goals and b) not biting or racially abusing anyone, prompting wonderful jokes about Adolf Hitler 'redeeming himself' with that 30-goal season for Sturm Graz. Like the audience who give the guests on Jeremy Kyle a round of applause for finding the strength to stop using the family allowance to buy crack, a lot of gullible people have been fooled - or have chosen to be fooled because, after all, he scores a lot of goals - by a total weapon briefly behaving like a decent human being. There is good news for those deluded Liverpool fans who would turn down Messi for the walking liability that is Suarez: He is now unlikely to join Real Madrid or Barcelona, two clubs who put far too much weight on commercial value to sign a footballer who would turn the stomach of many fans and sponsors. They baulked at signing him last summer after he grazed on Branislav Ivanovic and it's likely that they will baulk at signing him again after he repeated his trick on football's biggest stage. If Suarez had been keeping his nose (and teeth) clean for a year to re-build his reputation and earn himself a move, he has stumbled at the very last hurdle, just 12 or 13 minutes away from the end of his season as Uruguay faced World Cup exit. Such a low level of self-control is extraordinary. There will be those that ignore the video evidence and claim Suarez has been tried on reputation alone, there will those who claim that whatever he does in a Uruguayan shirt is irrelevant and there will be those who find somebody else to blame (the media again, perhaps?) for his indiscretions. But maybe there should also be those who admit that Liverpool only own one of the top five footballers in the world because he is so very, very flawed. Sarah Winterburn	sports
Failure By Fine Margins Teaches Nothing.... | F365 Says	Some will demand inquests but is there anything fundamentally wrong with England or are they just a half-decent side who came up narrowly short? The truth is pretty dull... Last Updated: 24/06/14 at 23:35 Post Comment Latest Articles Surely there comes a point when even his greatest Liverpool-supporting defenders put their hands up and admit he's a tool. But he's a tool that they'll probably keep now... Having been urged to 'give youth a chance' and 'change the shape' before Brazil, Roy Hodgson did exactly that. It's difficult to vilify a man that did what we would do, says Philip Cornwall... If somebody had said two weeks ago that England would end the their Group D campaign having had the most shots (38), allowed the opposition the fewest attempts (25), dribbled past twice as many opposition players (41) as their rivals and had a pass completion rate of 85%, our only question would have been whether that was enough for first place or we would have to settle for a runners-up spot. England have, quite bizarrely, recorded the statistics of a team who have started this World Cup with the form of potential semi-finalists, rather than a team who have ended their sorry sojourn with just one point. Which shows you that a) statistics can sometimes be incredibly misleading and b) England really have failed by fine margins. England are not Spain, the world and European champions who saw their creaking system and players torn apart by Holland and then Chile; they are not Portugal, who have once again been exposed as a one-man band without a tune; they have simply been narrowly beaten twice by teams of very similar strength and then drawn a dead rubber 0-0 after fielding a much-changed side. It's the kind of 'not quite' run that even the greatest teams and the greatest managers will 'suffer' at least once a season. But this is international football and there is no looming run of games where the 'not quite' can quickly become the 'just about'. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with this English team in their tactics, their attitude, their desire; they simply lack a little bit of quality and, in this tournament, a little bit of luck. The difference between England finishing top or bottom of that group were a scuffed shot here, a poor refereeing decision there, a failure to track here, a header an inch too high there. I am no more depressed about this England side on the evening of June 24 as I was on the morning of June 14. It still has the same strengths (attacking players who can run at the opposition, the promise of youth, hard-working wide players) and weaknesses (an average defence, a lack of holding midfielders, no truly world-class player to make the difference in close encounters). It is a side good enough to beat most but rarely good enough to beat the best. It's incredibly lazy to talk about a lack of passion, it's incredibly crass to cite war metaphors, it's incredibly short-sighted to blame the manager, it's incredibly forgetful to blame a foreign influx and it's incredibly boring for the rest of us when club loyalties take over and individual players are cited. The rather dull truth is that England came up narrowly short. Play those games again with the same players and the results may have been different enough to see England through as champions. Play them a third time and we may not score a goal or claim a single point. There are still a handful of reasons to be cheerful and many reasons to be cheerless about England's future - you'll read plenty about the latter in the coming weeks because of what happened in ten pretty unsurprising days in Brazil, but the former will be forgotten for the same reason.

Transfer news: Dinamo Moscow agree deal for Manchester United full-back Alexander Buttner | Football365 | Premier League News	Dinamo Moscow have confirmed that a deal to sign full-back Alexander Buttner from Manchester United has been agreed. Last Updated: 24/06/14 at 15:36 Post Comment Alexander Buttner: Agrees deal to join Dinamo Moscow The 25-year-old only moved to Old Trafford from Dutch side Vitesse in 2012, but as understudy to Patrice Evra he was limited to just 13 Premier League games over the course of two seasons in England. With Evra having signed a new one-year deal and Southampton left-back Luke Shaw also on United’s radar this summer, first-team opportunities for the new season appeared to be slim once again for Buttner. A three-year contract has been agreed to make the switch to the Russian capital and the deal will be finalised once technical details have been ironed out. Buttner told Dinamo’s official website: "I want to play in the Champions League and win trophies. "Dinamo have a very strong team and I believe we can fight for first place this season."	sports

Giving Rio £65,000 A Week. What Could Go Wrong? | Football365 | Opinion | Mailbox	Latest Articles Jack Rodwell can become the player England crave, according to one mailboxer. Others are enjoying Neymar and longing for Jose Mourinho as England boss... It does seem a tad ridiculous. But it will allow Liverpool to build half a team. We have lots of mails on England really not being bad, Henderson for captain and more... If you have anything to say on any subject, mail us at theeditor@football365.com We Got a Few Of These Terry Hall, Switzerland. Jack Rodwell England Captain in 2016? Are you on drugs? James, Ireland Not Wanting England To Win Without wanting to be accused of treason and marched to the front door of a grieving family by Ian Wright, I think a convincing victory for England today could be the worst thing that could happen, and that's not just for the headline 'Costa Eureka!' that will adorn the papers tomorrow. Of course, it makes sense to always have half an eye on the next major tournament, and the expansion to 24 teams in the European Championships means that England should really never fail to qualify for it ever again, but much like any game of football, you should be picking your best players to get the job done. Tonight is a meaningless game for England and I can understand the experimentation, but should they win 3-0, that does not mean this is England's best team. The cry for this massively inexperienced team to carry on into the qualifiers for Euro 2016 will be deafening and I only hope Roy Hodgson has the sense about him to realise that actually, the team he picked for the first two games is, more or less, his best team, even if it wasn't utilised in the best manner. There are question marks of course, and as with any tournament, you would expect a couple of players to be phased out. Wholesale change though is not needed. Wholesale change has already happened in many respects when you look at this squad compared to that of even two years ago. Half the squad has changed already - that's major surgery! Many people seem to be pinning their hopes on the likes of Luke Shaw, who is a very good player but is still very young, and John Stones, who has a handful of impressive games for Everton under his belt. These guys may turn out to be wonderful players, but if they don't break into the England team until they're 22/23, that isn't the end of the world. Seriously, when will we learn? Leighton Baines, despite being 29, is still a relative newcomer to the international scene and deserves a chance to bed in. The same is true of the likes of Lallana, Henderson, Wilshere and even Jagielka and Cahill. Because of the longevity of the previous generation, we have a raft of players in their mid to late twenties with very little international experience. Any good team has the right mix of youth and experience. To throw the likes of Gerrard, Rooney (and dare I say it, Ashley Cole) on the scrap heap too early would be cutting off our nose to spite our face. Italy with Pirlo and Mexico with Marquez have both put extra players in certain areas on their team to allow their older players to continue to flourish, which is something Hodgson has neglected to do. Isn't something along those lines worthy of experimentation as much as filling the team full of kids who have thus far shown no signs of surpassing the people they are being lined up to replace? I think, as a nation, we are sorely mistaken if we think we have players of the quality of Gerrard, Lampard and Rooney coming through our ranks. If it forces us to focus on the collective rather than the individual then it's for the better, but forgive me if I remain sceptical on that one. Andy, London England had The Group Of Death Ever since the WC draw, Group G with Germany/Portugal/USA/Ghana has been dubbed the "group of death". At the time, I couldn't argue. As of December 6, 2013, Ze Germans were ranked 2nd, Portugal 5th, USA 14th and Ghana 24th. 45 total? That's ridiculous! Come the start of the World Cup, however, Despite Germany still being 2nd, Portugal up to 4th and USA up to 13th, Ghana had dropped to 37th. That's a combined total of 56. Uruguay at 7th, Italy at 9th, England at 10th and Costa Rica at 28th gives us a total of 54, the lowest combined ranking of any group. We were 6/7/13/31 for 57 at the time of the draw. I still hold onto some hope that we can beat Costa Rica today and save some face after playing the REAL Group of Death at this year's WC. Dickon, Sandford Send Them All To School With a country of 60 million people, amongst the highest paid players in the world, a smorgasbord of talent, why do we always fail dismally at international competition. To answer this, you must find the unique characteristic of the English footballer. And this is found at the heart, no the arse of this septic isle. The chav. The ignoramus who lionized Jade Goody (God rest her soul), the country that invented binge drinking, the nation with the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in Europe, the 'fan' who whilst not inventing football hooliganism, gave it that English touch; the English footballer is royalty amongst them all. This squad is dumb and getting dumber. Ask yourself how many players speak a foreign language ('Professor' Lampard's latin doesn't count). Most squads are bi-lingual and more. Why has no player in the Premiership come out as Gay, why do none of the squad play abroad? Why does an intelligent guy like Graeme Le Saux get hounded for reading the Guardian? The questions just pile up and the answer is always the same. Because the English footballer is dumb. Effectively taken from school at a young age, he is afraid of what's outside his comfort zone where his job on the pitch is drilled into him until thought is no longer required. And he has every right to be afraid because once he's playing for a different team and the opposition mixes it up a bit, changes their formation, plays with intelligence to maximize their qualities and expose deficiencies in the opposition, England players are left flat footed, literally and metaphorically - witness Gerrards utter lack of awareness of the gap on the left midfield and Rooney continuing to play where he does at Man U. Mercy! Glen Hoddle alluded to it with his plea for 'flexibility'. Lineaker alluded to it with his reference to Gerrards lack of 'football nous'. Chris Waddle shouts it from the rooftops but there aint no debate because the football-media are (wait for it) ex-footballers or journos too damned scared to rock the boat through fear of losing their stipend. The English footballer is dumb. He is uneducated. He cannot therefore react dynamically to change. And it aint gonna change until society changes. I sound like a snob. So what. Have you ever wondered why the English Rugby team is good (the pundit and ex hooker fercrisskes Brian Moore is a qualified solicitor - how many....no don't bother), the English cricket team was until recently the best. They're thinking people. The English footballer is not and that Ladies and Gentlemen is why. Adrian O'Sullivan Having A Rio Carnival So the inevitable has finally happened. Rio is joining the triffic lads down at Loftus Road. According to the papers he has taken a pay cut to join us and is on about 1/3 of his previous salary....so about £65,000 a week. Im trying to stay positive, and say the only reason he will be more motivated than the overpaid tripe we bought last time (Bosingwa, im looking at you) is that 'Arry gave him in his chance therefore he wouldn't want to let him down. And then i realise we've given £65,000 a week to a 35 year old - our four centre backs are C.Hill, R Dunne, R Ferdinand, N Onuoha -and if you take Onuhoa out and put these three in a foot race, you'd have to clear your weekend diary to see the winner finish. But not to worry - he's triffic. Smuggler McSmugglerson Worried About Inflated Fees I'm sure you will have seen a lot of this in the comments section recently but I am finding it hard to get my head around some of the transfer fees being touted this summer. I'm a Manchester United season ticket holder and whilst I'm delighted that we are looking to rebuild (any also with Van Gaal's promise at the World Cup) I cannot but be a little worried. £34m for a left back with only two years Premier League experience and no CL football reeks of a huge risk, and whilst I believe Herrera is a good player is he worth one and a half Ruud Van Nistelrooys? I used to remember getting extremely excited when a player was costing more than £20m, but now it seems it has to be the norm for anyone half decent. I understand inflation and the fact that Chelski and the oil money next door have somewhat driven up the costs, but with FFP in place I am slightly bemused - is anyone else? Annoyingly, and I despise the man, the only player who seems to actually be worth the amounts being quoted in the press is that Uruguayan chap who tends to bite people. Jack, Battersea Three's A Crowd Following on from Hulmy's observation about Dani Alves sporting three different haircuts in three different games, I was wondering has any other team worn three different jerseys in three different group games before like Spain did in this World Cup? They wore all white against The Netherlands, all red against Chile and all black against Australia. Thoroughly interesting I'm sure you'll agree. Kieran Whooley (This esteemed MC is sad enough to point out that France in 1978 is your answer) Oh, You Guys Excellent Mediawatch today guys. Really, really good. Dominic Philpot	sports

Shotton is a product of Stoke's academy system and has played 70 first-team games for the Potters. The 25-year-old's versatility in that he can play in defence and midfield makes him an attractive proposition for his suitors as they look to bolster their squad options.	sports

I'd consider a straight swap, Messi for Suarez would be an acceptable gamble (and it would be a gamble - Messi's relatively poor form this season could be the beginnings of a decline) but I'd rather keep Suarez. Hopefully Suarez meant it when he said he doesn't want to leave and will come out and say it again after the World Cup. That was our favourite comment but there have been others - from those who refuse to believe that Suarez might want to leave Liverpool, just as they refused to believe that he might want to leave Liverpool last summer, refused to believe that he would use racist language and refused to believe that two biting incidents were anything other than coincidence. Now there's a third. As we are struggling to name more than a handful of footballers who have felt the need to sink their teeth into an opposition player once, surely even the Uruguayan's staunchest suppporters have to admit that three times offers pretty compelling evidence that they have been defending the indefensible. We have been told that he has redeemed himself this season by a) scoring a lot of goals and b) not biting or racially abusing anyone, prompting wonderful jokes about Adolf Hitler 'redeeming himself' with that 30-goal season for Sturm Graz. Like the audience who give the guests on Jeremy Kyle a round of applause for finding the strength to stop using the family allowance to buy crack, a lot of gullible people have been fooled - or have chosen to be fooled because, after all, he scores a lot of goals - by a total weapon briefly behaving like a decent human being. There is good news for those deluded Liverpool fans who would turn down Messi for the walking liability that is Suarez: He is now unlikely to join Real Madrid or Barcelona, two clubs who put far too much weight on commercial value to sign a footballer who would turn the stomach of many fans and sponsors. They baulked at signing him last summer after he grazed on Branislav Ivanovic and it's likely that they will baulk at signing him again after he repeated his trick on football's biggest stage. If Suarez had been keeping his nose (and teeth) clean for a year to re-build his reputation and earn himself a move, he has stumbled at the very last hurdle, just 12 or 13 minutes away from the end of his season as Uruguay faced World Cup exit. Such a low level of self-control is extraordinary. There will be those that ignore the video evidence and claim Suarez has been tried on reputation alone, there will those who claim that whatever he does in a Uruguayan shirt is irrelevant and there will be those who find somebody else to blame (the media again, perhaps?) for his indiscretions. But maybe there should also be those who admit that Liverpool only own one of the top five footballers in the world because he is so very, very flawed. Sarah Winterburn	sports

Failure By Fine Margins Teaches Nothing.... | F365 Says	Some will demand inquests but is there anything fundamentally wrong with England or are they just a half-decent side who came up narrowly short?

Last Updated: 24/06/14 at 23:35 Post Comment Latest Articles Surely there comes a point when even his greatest Liverpool-supporting defenders put their hands up and admit he's a tool.

It's difficult to vilify a man that did what we would do, says Philip Cornwall... If somebody had said two weeks ago that England would end the their Group D campaign having had the most shots (38), allowed the opposition the fewest attempts (25), dribbled past twice as many opposition players (41) as their rivals and had a pass completion rate of 85%, our only question would have been whether that was enough for first place or we would have to settle for a runners-up spot. England have, quite bizarrely, recorded the statistics of a team who have started this World Cup with the form of potential semi-finalists, rather than a team who have ended their sorry sojourn with just one point. Which shows you that a) statistics can sometimes be incredibly misleading and b) England really have failed by fine margins. England are not Spain, the world and European champions who saw their creaking system and players torn apart by Holland and then Chile; they are not Portugal, who have once again been exposed as a one-man band without a tune; they have simply been narrowly beaten twice by teams of very similar strength and then drawn a dead rubber 0-0 after fielding a much-changed side. It's the kind of 'not quite' run that even the greatest teams and the greatest managers will 'suffer' at least once a season. But this is international football and there is no looming run of games where the 'not quite' can quickly become the 'just about'. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with this English team in their tactics, their attitude, their desire; they simply lack a little bit of quality and, in this tournament, a little bit of luck. The difference between England finishing top or bottom of that group were a scuffed shot here, a poor refereeing decision there, a failure to track here, a header an inch too high there. I am no more depressed about this England side on the evening of June 24 as I was on the morning of June 14. It still has the same strengths (attacking players who can run at the opposition, the promise of youth, hard-working wide players) and weaknesses (an average defence, a lack of holding midfielders, no truly world-class player to make the difference in close encounters). It is a side good enough to beat most but rarely good enough to beat the best. It's incredibly lazy to talk about a lack of passion, it's incredibly crass to cite war metaphors, it's incredibly short-sighted to blame the manager, it's incredibly forgetful to blame a foreign influx and it's incredibly boring for the rest of us when club loyalties take over and individual players are cited. The rather dull truth is that England came up narrowly short. Play those games again with the same players and the results may have been different enough to see England through as champions. Play them a third time and we may not score a goal or claim a single point. There are still a handful of reasons to be cheerful and many reasons to be cheerless about England's future - you'll read plenty about the latter in the coming weeks because of what happened in ten pretty unsurprising days in Brazil, but the former will be forgotten for the same reason.

Transfer news: Premier League and Championship clubs chasing Stoke's Ryan Shotton | Football365 | Premier League News	Sky Sports understands a number of Premier League and Championship clubs are tracking Stoke City's Ryan Shotton. Last Updated: 24/06/14 at 16:19 Post Comment Ryan Shotton: Attracting interest from several clubs Shotton spent the first half of last season on loan at Wigan and he did not feature for Stoke after returning to the Britannia Stadium in January. News of Shotton's possible availability this summer has alerted a number of Premier League and Championship clubs. Shotton is a product of Stoke's academy system and has played 70 first-team games for the Potters. The 25-year-old's versatility in that he can play in defence and midfield makes him an attractive proposition for his suitors as they look to bolster their squad options.	sports

Transfer news: Veteran defender Rio Ferdinand in talks over move to Queens Park Rangers | Football365 | Premier League News	Rio Ferdinand is in talks with newly-promoted Queens Park Rangers – but that no deal has been done yet. Last Updated: 24/06/14 at 14:26 Post Comment Rio Ferdinand: Sees himself as an active footballer Ferdinand is a free agent after being released by Manchester United at the end of last season after 12 years at Old Trafford. If Ferdinand chooses to move to Loftus Road it will be the second time he has worked under Harry Redknapp. Ferdinand's representative Jamie Moralee has confirmed to Sky Sports News that Ferdinand is in talks over a proposed move to Loftus Road but no deal has been done as yet. Redknapp was the manager who gave him his debut at West Ham in 1996, and Ferdinand was the world’s most expensive defender when he left to join Leeds United in an £18million deal in 2000. Ferdinand moved to Old Trafford on a five-year contract in another record deal in July 2002 and went on to win six Premier League titles and the 2008 Champions League during his time with United. He played 81 times for England between 1997 and 2011 and was a member of three World Cup squads. Speaking before he headed to Brazil, where he is working as a World Cup pundit, Ferdinand said: "I see myself as going to Rio very much as an active footballer with playing time ahead of me. "It is feasible that in the coming weeks, perhaps even while I'm in South America, I'll make a decision about the next stage in my career. "I have options on the table from several clubs in England and overseas for next season and I'm intending to play on if the right situation arises." Rio's brother Anton played for QPR for two seasons, leaving Loftus Road following their relegation to the Championship in 2013. 	sports

Transfer news: Newcastle defender Mathieu Debuchy admits to missing Champions League | Football365 | Premier League News	Mathieu Debuchy plans to address his Newcastle United future after the World Cup as he admits to missing UEFA Champions League football. Last Updated: 25/06/14 at 08:52 Post Comment Mathieu Debuchy: Has caught the eye at Newcastle The France international graced European football’s premier club competition during his days at Lille, having helped them to the Ligue 1 title in 2011. A move to England followed in January 2013, with Debuchy joining the growing ranks of French talent at St James’ Park. The 28-year-old has been a consistent performer for an inconsistent Newcastle side and is currently chasing down global glory with his countrymen in Brazil. Speculation is mounting that he could be on the move once his efforts in South America come to a close, with Paris Saint-Germain among those said to be keen, and Debuchy has hinted that he may be willing to consider a switch. He said in the Evening Chronicle: “Personally, it’s a great adventure. I have discovered English charm, which is very hard, Newcastle and their extraordinary fans. “It’s really incredible to play in that atmosphere. “Having said that, I miss European football and the Champions League in particular. “For the moment, I’m concentrating on the World Cup. We’ll see about the rest afterwards.” For now, Debuchy’s focus is locked on keeping himself ahead of Manchester City new boy Bacary Sagna in France coach Didier Deschamps’ plans. Ahead of a meeting with Ecuador on Wednesday, which has France looking to make it three wins from three in Group E, he added: “I want to play against Ecuador, but it could be a good chance to get others involved. It’s up to the coach to decide. “The guys that haven’t played so far want to play in this game, we’re all competitive. I don’t count myself as a starter in this side, I take it one match at a time. “It’s great to play in this French team, as we’ve taken a huge step forward. The thing I love is our attacking play, it’s great to be a part of it.”	sports

If Suarez had been keeping his nose (and teeth) clean for a year to re-build his reputation and earn himself a move, he has stumbled at the very last hurdle, just 12 or 13 minutes away from the end of his season as Uruguay faced World Cup exit. Such a low level of self-control is extraordinary. There will be those that ignore the video evidence and claim Suarez has been tried on reputation alone, there will those who claim that whatever he does in a Uruguayan shirt is irrelevant and there will be those who find somebody else to blame (the media again, perhaps?) for his indiscretions. But maybe there should also be those who admit that Liverpool only own one of the top five footballers in the world because he is so very, very flawed. Sarah Winterburn	sports

A number of players have been linked with moves out of the Britannia Stadium, including experienced striker Peter Crouch, and Coates admits players will leave as they look to maintain the size of the squad. "There is certainly no financial pressure to sell," Coates told the Stoke Sentinel. "It's a question of the numbers and the balance of the squad. "There comes a point when a squad can become difficult to manage because of the numbers, so size is very important. "But ultimately, of course, it is always down to the manager who comes and who goes."	sports

Midfielder Yaya and Liverpool defender Kolo Toure are currently in Brazil with the Ivory Coast squad at the World Cup. And Yaya Toure told France Football that City prevented him from leaving the title celebrations in Dubai. He said: "City did not want to give me a few days. I went to celebrate in the wake of the league title in Abu Dhabi, while my brother was dying in his bed. "In retrospect, I regret not having insisted. For not making them respect me. However, my employers knew that I was suffering for a few months seeing my brother's health decline." Toure also said of Ibrahim: "He was my confidant, my best friend too." City have declined to comment on Toure's remarks but it is understood they were not approached about the possibility of him returning to the UK. The club has granted compassionate leave in the past – former boss Roberto Mancini missed a game following the death of his father.	sports

Last Updated: 24/06/14 at 15:49 Post Comment Ander Herrera: On verge of move to Manchester United Sky sources understand United are prepared to match the £28million buyout clause in the midfielder’s contract. United are aiming to get the deal - which would see Herrera sign a four-year contract - done by the end of this month as the buyout clause raises to £32m after 1 July. Herrera was the lynchpin of Bilbao's midfield last season as they finished in an impressive fourth place in La Liga.  He scored five goals in the campaign, but despite being one of the most impressive performers in domestic football, he is yet to break in to the Spain team. David Moyes was reportedly targeting Herrera, 24, last summer, but failed to land the central midfielder. There were bizarre scenes in Spain when, on transfer deadline, three men claiming to be representing United tried to negotiate the deal at the Spanish Football Association headquarters. The negotiations broke down and it transpired that United knew nothing about the three men.  But Moyes' successor as Manchester United boss, Louis van Gaal, looks set to pull off the deal as he begins rebuilding the squad. Herrera was born in Bilbao but came through the ranks at Real Zaragoza before joining his hometown club in 2011 on a five-year contract. Sky Sports News reporter James Cooper said: "It is very, very close. It is a question of when, not if. It is more likely to be on Wednesday but Manchester United are very close to making their first signing of the summer and the first signing under Louis van Gaal. "But Manchester United are proving they can go and get a player. It's a question of 'if at first you don't succeed, try, try, try again. Last summer there were some farcical scenes. Manchester United didn't match the buy-out clause. We saw the three stooges arrive at the Spanish FA headquarters - and the whole thing tumbled from there. "United have their own lawyers on the case this time and they have met the buy-out clause. Now it's a medical and personal terms with the player, and the beginning of a new era at Manchester United.  "A £30m fee is a big fee perhaps for a player who is 24 years old but who has not played for the Spanish national team. He did play for the Olympic team in London in 2012. But Manchester United have started their transfer business - and there will be plenty more, I promise you that." Southampton and England left-back Luke Shaw could be the next target - United have reportedly upped their offer for him to around £34m. 	sports

Transfer news: Newcastle defender Mathieu Debuchy admits to missing Champions League | Football365 | Premier League News	Mathieu Debuchy plans to address his Newcastle United future after the World Cup as he admits to missing UEFA Champions League football. Last Updated: 25/06/14 at 08:52 Post Comment Mathieu Debuchy: Has caught the eye at Newcastle The France international graced European football’s premier club competition during his days at Lille, having helped them to the Ligue 1 title in 2011. A move to England followed in January 2013, with Debuchy joining the growing ranks of French talent at St James’ Park. The 28-year-old has been a consistent performer for an inconsistent Newcastle side and is currently chasing down global glory with his countrymen in Brazil. Speculation is mounting that he could be on the move once his efforts in South America come to a close, with Paris Saint-Germain among those said to be keen, and Debuchy has hinted that he may be willing to consider a switch. He said in the Evening Chronicle: “Personally, it’s a great adventure. I have discovered English charm, which is very hard, Newcastle and their extraordinary fans. “It’s really incredible to play in that atmosphere. “Having said that, I miss European football and the Champions League in particular. “For the moment, I’m concentrating on the World Cup. We’ll see about the rest afterwards.” For now, Debuchy’s focus is locked on keeping himself ahead of Manchester City new boy Bacary Sagna in France coach Didier Deschamps’ plans. Ahead of a meeting with Ecuador on Wednesday, which has France looking to make it three wins from three in Group E, he added: “I want to play against Ecuador, but it could be a good chance to get others involved. It’s up to the coach to decide. “The guys that haven’t played so far want to play in this game, we’re all competitive. I don’t count myself as a starter in this side, I take it one match at a time. “It’s great to play in this French team, as we’ve taken a huge step forward. The thing I love is our attacking play, it’s great to be a part of it.”	sports
Transfer news: Stoke chairman Peter Coates confirms players will leave | Football365 | Premier League News	Stoke City chairman Peter Coates has admitted there will be departures from the club before the end of the transfer window. Last Updated: 24/06/14 at 12:01 Post Comment Peter Coates: Admits players will leave Stoke this summer The Potters have been busy in the transfer market this summer bringing in four new signings to bolster Mark Hughes' squad. A number of players have been linked with moves out of the Britannia Stadium, including experienced striker Peter Crouch, and Coates admits players will leave as they look to maintain the size of the squad. "There is certainly no financial pressure to sell," Coates told the Stoke Sentinel. "It's a question of the numbers and the balance of the squad. "There comes a point when a squad can become difficult to manage because of the numbers, so size is very important. "But ultimately, of course, it is always down to the manager who comes and who goes."	sports
Transfer news: Diego Costa's transfer from Atletico Madrid to Chelsea not done yet | Football365 | Premier League News	Diego Costa’s move to Chelsea is not yet a done deal and Thibaut Courtois will not be returning to Atletico Madrid, according to the Spanish club’s president Enrique Cerezo. Last Updated: 24/06/14 at 11:45 Post Comment Diego Costa: Part of Spain's miserable defence of their World Cup crown Cerezo confirmed Chelsea have made contact but have not agreed to meet the buy-out clause for the Brazilian-born striker, who was part of a dismal World Cup showing from Spain. The forward has long been linked with a big-money move to join Jose Mourinho at Chelsea, but Cerezo maintains the deal is far from complete. "We don't know anything about Costa, all we know is that Chelsea have made contact but we haven't received any money or anything else yet," Cerezo said. "Until we receive the money from his buy-out clause, he remains an Atletico player." Costa, 26, spearheaded Atletico’s attack in a memorable season in which they won La Liga and reached the Champions League final under Argentine manager Diego Simeone. Atletico have a history of losing their marquee players with Fernando Torres, Sergio Aguero and Radamel Falcao all having left the club in recent years. The Atletico president admitted it is very difficult to say no when the biggest teams in Europe come calling. "We've always tried to convince our players to stay, but the difference between our finances and that of other clubs is very large," he said. Cerezo also confirmed Belgian goalkeeping star Courtois, who has been on loan to Atletico for the past three seasons, is set to return to Chelsea. "Chelsea can count on Courtois, because he is their player," he said. That will set up an enviable dilemma for Mourinho as he will have to choose between Courtois and long-time first-choice goalkeeper Peter Cech. In addition to the likely departures of Costa and Courtois, Atletico have bid farewell to David Villa, who has signed for Melbourne City, and Tiago Mendes, who is out of contract. Brazilian defenders Filipe Luis and Joao Miranda have also been linked with moves away from the Vicente Calderon Stadium. Atletico have a ready-made replacement for Luis if he does depart after signing highly-rated left-back Guilherme Siqueira from Granada.   "That's the way football is," added Cerezo on the changes the La Liga champions will undergo this summer. "We will try and get new players to come in who can score more goals or save more goals than the ones that are leaving."	sports
Transfer news: Norwich City boss Neil Adams remains realistic over potential losses | Football365 | Premier League News	Neil Adams has warned Norwich City must be prepared to replace any players who may leave in the final week of the close season.

However, Adams remains a realist and understands that situation could drastically change before the window closes. This summer’s FIFA World Cup in Brazil has provided a distraction from the usual hive of transfer activity, and Adams admits he would delighted to keep his full squad intact. “If players leave, we’ve got to be ready to fill their positions,” Adams told the Norwich Evening News. “I don’t want players leaving, but of course I’m realistic to accept that might be the case. “I spoke to all the players at the end of last season - obviously not as full-time manager then, just to see whether they wanted to leave or be part of getting us back. “And virtually to a man, they were committed and there was a hunger there. Players who wanted to go and put it right.” Canaries playmaker Robert Snodgrass would be a significant loss and speculation surrounding the Scotland international’s future heightened on Monday with Sky Sources reporting Europa League-bound Hull City and fellow Premier League clubs QPR, Sunderland and West Brom have registered interest.	sports
Transfer news: Belgium striker Divock Origi admits Premier League football is his dream | Football365 | Premier League News	Belgium goal-hero Divock Origi admits that playing in the Premier League is his dream after enjoying a breakthrough at the World Cup. Last Updated: 24/06/14 at 14:16 Post Comment Divock Origi: Reported to be attracting interest after an impressive World Cup The 19-year-old, who currently plays in France with Lille, has impressed during his two substitute appearances in Brazil and he stepped off the bench to net a late winner as Belgium beat Russia 1-0 to secure their place in the last 16. Tottenham have reportedly been keeping tabs on the striker, while Arsenal and Liverpool are among the host of other European clubs to have been linked with a move for him. Origi says that he is only concerned about the World Cup at this moment in time, but acknowledges that playing in the top flight of English football is something that has appealed to him for some time. "As a little boy I always dreamed of playing in the Premier League but I'm still young and now I'm in an important tournament so I'm try to focus on the team," he said. "Then my entourage will see with Lille what I'll do." Origi featured 30 times in Ligue 1 last season, scoring six goals in the process as Lille secured an impressive third-placed finish.	sports

Di Maria, who has been linked with Manchester United and Manchester City, insists he is focusing on his country’s attempts to win their third world title but admits he does not know whether he will be at the Bernabeu next season. Di Maria said: "I've asked my agent not to tell me anything about the talks he's having. "I don't know what's going to happen with my career. I don't want to know anything about my future right now. "I'm focusing on my national team and not on what's going on elsewhere,” he added. "My team-mates and I don't read or listen to all the things being said in the media. "We're just thinking about ourselves and the unity of the group." Argentina struggled to a win over their Iranian counterparts, who seemed content to play a defensive game, and Di Maria has reacted angrily to suggestions that his side played below-par on Saturday. He told reporters: "I don't know why you keep saying we weren't playing well. When a team has 11 players in penalty area it's impossible to get in there."	sports

"If the amount of money that the newspaper mentions is true and we receive an offer like that, then River could sit down and start negotiations as it would be close to the amount the club expects for transferring Balanta. "If the money that is being mentioned in the English media is that, then we will have to listen to them when we receive an official offer. "Of course we would want to sell our players to the team that gets closest to our value." Balanta is currently with the Colombia squad at the World Cup finals.	sports

"This club has fantastic supporters and their backing has been phenomenal. Hopefully we can give them something to cheer about after what has been a very difficult 12 months for everyone at the club.

A number of other clubs have also been connected to Balotelli, including Milan’s Serie A rivals Napoli, and Berlusconi has opened the door to a possible departure. "Balotelli is a great player and a real Italian talent, but nobody is irreplaceable. We’ll see what happens," said Berlusconi, who is the daughter of club president Silvio Berlusconi and also joint-CEO. Kaka's future at Milan is also in doubt after Major League Soccer side Orlando City revealed they were in talks over a deal to sign the Brazilian, and Berlusconi admits he too could leave. She said: "Kaka made history with Milan and I know he needs to make this important decision with absolute calm. If he stays then we’ll be happy, but we’ll have to take it into account if he does want to go." While the likes of Baloteli and Kaka could be on their way out of the San Siro during the transfer window, Milan are still keen to strengthen their squad. Highly-rated Hellas Verona forward Juan Manuel Iturbe is one player on their radar and Berlusconi hopes a deal can be agreed. "Adriano Galliani (chief executive) and my father are working on it. This is a very solid club, among the best in Europe in terms of income," she said at a press conference.	sports

"I’m in the game long enough to know that and I’m more than happy with Sunderland." Staying put O'Shea has played over 100 games in his three seasons with Sunderland and insists he is looking to continue turning out at the top level for a while longer. "I definitely want to play on beyond next season," he said. "I played around 50 games last season and I'm fit and well, and long may that continue. "I'm already looking forward to next season after what was a roller-coaster end to last year. "But as for my future, that will be down to Sunderland. "I've never forced the issue throughout my career and I’m not about to start now. "Look, it was great getting to the League Cup final and that was definitely an ambition when I joined Sunderland, to get to a Cup final and obviously to win one. "It would have been special had we held on that day but unfortunately that brilliant Yaya Toure goal put City back in it before Samir Nasri won it."	sports
Transfer news: French striker Bafetimbi Gomis flying to Swansea for talks | Football365 | Premier League News	Sky sources understand French striker Bafetimbi Gomis is flying to Swansea on Monday to hold talks over a potential move to the Liberty Stadium. Last Updated: 23/06/14 at 14:59 Post Comment Batefimbi Gomis: Set for Swansea talks The 28-year-old is expected to meet with Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins and the club’s manager Garry Monk to thrash out terms over a free transfer. Gomis is one of the most sought after free agents in Europe, following the expiry of his contract with Ligue 1 side Lyon. The France international scored 22 goals in 49 appearances in all competitions for Lyon last season and had been linked with a move to Premier League sides Newcastle, Sunderland and West Ham. Gomis is not part of Didier Deschamps’ France World Cup squad but has made 12 appearances for Les Bleus, scoring three times. Swansea are thought to have bid for Gomis last summer, before they signed Wilfried Bony. The move for Gomis will inevitably put a question mark over Bony’s future with the club. The 25-year-old’s agent recently said Bony will remain with Swansea unless the opportunity arises for him to move to a top six side in England, Germany, France or Spain. Bony became Swansea’s club-record signing when he made a £13million move from Vitesse Arnhem and is currently on international duty at the World Cup with Ivory Coast. Swansea also have Spanish forward Michu on their books, although the former Rayo Vallecano man has been linked with West Ham, Stoke and Napoli. Michu scored 22 goals in his first season with Swansea but only found the back of the net on six occasions last term.	sports

Jose Mourinho has already stated that Courtois was in his plans for next season and Wilmots has confirmed this, but also added to the intrigue surrounding current No.1 Petr Cech, suggesting he could be sold. The conversation between Houllier and Courtois was broadcast by RTBF, in which the Frenchman asked: "Does he [Courtois] go back to Chelsea?" "He goes back to Chelsea," Wilmots replied. "They will sell Cech, then?" enquired Houllier, "If possible, yes," said the Belgian coach. Courtois has already suggested he would be heading back to Chelsea, and if he does it remains to be seen how that will impact on Cech, who has played over 300 games for the west London giants after joining from Rennes in 2004.	sports

AIFF President Praful Patel said: “The AIFF is extremely pleased to be a part of the strategic partnership between the Premier League and the Indian Super League. “This is an outstanding opportunity for the Indian Super League to build from the very best in the business when it comes to running a highly successful league. "The Premier League is revered around the world, and by learning from the practitioners who have made it so successful, the Indian Super League will develop and grow in the right way, ensuring benefits not only for the league itself but also for the wider Indian football ecosystem in the longer term."

Last Updated: 24/06/14 at 10:13 Post Comment Alberto Moreno: Wanted by Liverpool Castro revealed earlier this month that Liverpool were leading the chase for the highly-rated 21-year-old, although no deal has yet been agreed. The Sevilla chief insists that he will not be selling Moreno for less than the value they have set on the player - and Moreno has a release clause of £24.5million. "It's true that there is interest from a number of clubs, above all Liverpool, in him, but we haven't had proper conversations about selling him," Castro told ABC. "We haven't reached an agreement, but talks haven't broken down. We'll wait and see what happens. "If Liverpool are interested in the player and pay the right amount, he will be sold. "Signing any player from this club has a price and we will decide that price. "If Alberto Moreno has to stay at the club he will stay but if a club pays the amount we think is big enough for him to leave, he will leave. But there is no pressure."	sports
I never dodged England duty, insists Scott Parker after Harry Redknapp claims | News	Scott Parker says he never wanted to sidestep England duty, following claims made by his former manager at Tottenham, Harry Redknapp. Last Updated: 25/06/14 at 07:35 Post Comment Scott Parker: England appearances the "pinnacle" of his career Redknapp claimed that "two or three" English players had asked him to withdraw them from international duty while he was in charge at White Hart Lane between 2008 and 2012. The now-QPR boss has refused to name names but Parker, who won 18 England caps between 2003 and 2012 and spent two years playing under Redknapp at Spurs - insisted that featuring for his country had been the "pinnacle" of his career. Asked if he had never not wanted to represent England, Parker told Sky Sports News: "No, never. "I probably speak for every boy and everyone out there: playing for your country, replicating the players in the World Cup is something you dream of. "I remember Italia '90, being 10 and playing outside in the garden, thinking I was Gazza (Paul Gascoigne) and my friends thinking the same. "I can only speak from a personal level - obviously you get some people in life who'll be different - but I think the majority of players who put on an England shirt are very proud. "I hear people say that other countries are more passionate and have more desire but whenever I've been involved in the England set-up, the players have been committed. "It's a boy's dream; I can't contemplate not wanting to play for England. It's something I will always remember, the pinnacle of my career."	sports

World Cup: Frank Lampard unsure over England future after Costa Rica draw | News	Frank Lampard remains unsure over his international future after England’s World Cup campaign limped to a conclusion with a 0-0 draw against Costa Rica. Last Updated: 24/06/14 at 20:39 Post Comment Frank Lampard: Veteran midfielder captained England in 0-0 draw with Costa Rica The veteran midfielder, who will end his long association with Chelsea this summer, captained the side but could not lead them to victory over Costa Rica, who progress to the last 16 as Group D winners with England at the bottom of the table. With Lampard now 36, it is likely to have been his final World Cup appearance, but he insists he is yet to decide when he will call time on his career with the Three Lions. When asked about his future, he told ITV: "I don't know. I really enjoyed being involved and I love playing for my country, that's obvious. I am 36 and still doing it. "I feel fresh. If I feel I can offer something I will do but at the moment it is too soon to say." Lampard agreed with Roy Hodgson’s post-match assessment that England had been the better side and could have won the game comfortably had they taken the opportunities they created, while also paying tribute to the support of the travelling fans. He added: "It was a difficult game to approach. "I think we did everything we could do. We showed a bit of character, we prepared right for the last two days. Everyone knows how tough it's been. "It wasn't vintage but we had enough chances to win the game. I think we played some good stuff, bright stuff at times, and created enough chances to win. “We’re England, we expect more, they expect more and we didn’t deliver. England fans have been an absolute credit, it’s a shame we couldn’t do enough to take them through and give them a longer trip.”	sports
Barcelona and Real Madrid attract backing to sign Luis Suarez amid renewed press reports | Football365 | Premier League News	Sky Bet have slashed the odds on Luis Suarez leaving Liverpool this summer with Barcelona and Real Madrid both backed to secure his services. Last Updated: 23/06/14 at 15:08 Post Comment Luis Suarez: Linked with Barcelona and Real Madrid yet again Press reports surrounding a release clause in the Uruguay star's contract seem to have sparked the surge in interest, with suggestions that the Spanish giants are ready to engage in a battle for his signature. On the back of a phenomenal campaign for the Reds, in which he netted 31 times to put them on the brink of winning the Premier League, Suarez sent England crashing out of the World Cup with a brace on Thursday night. The 27-year-old recently moved to allay fears of his departure, telling Uruguayan TV channel Canal 10: "Don't worry, nothing is going to happen to me. I'm very happy here and my family is happy here." He also signed a new long-term contract in December but that has done little to prevent renewed speculation on a move to Spain this summer. Sky Bet's Head of Football Trading Paul Wiggins said: "We've seen a sudden surge in bets on Suarez's next club, with Barcelona in particular attracting backing. "While we're assuming these bets are a result of the media speculation as opposed to any inside knowledge, the volume of interest has forced us to cut his price on leaving from 2/1 to 5/6, with both Barcelona and Real Madrid 9/4 to get a deal done."

Premier League: Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud wants to improve scoring record | Football365 | Premier League News	Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud is determined to improve his scoring record and revealed manager Arsene Wenger is offering him plenty of guidance. Last Updated: 23/06/14 at 10:47 Post Comment Olivier Giroud: Looking to improve his scoring record at Arsenal The Gunners striker is currently helping France’s World Cup bid in Brazil and claimed an historic goal for his country during Friday’s 5-2 triumph over Switzerland. After being used as a second-half substitute in a 3-0 win over Honduras, Giroud was brought into the starting line-up and got Les Bleus off to a flying start with a 17th-minute header which took France to 100 World Cup goals. On the domestic front, Giroud netted 16 goals and chalked up eight assists as Arsenal finished fourth in the Premier League but the 27-year-old is well aware of the need for a better return. “I feel I can go on improving,” he told L’Equipe. “I can improve some parts of my game and have better statistics. “For a forward, statistics are important, especially when you negotiate a contract. In the Champions League, it was more difficult. But you also need titles and key performances. “I am working hard in front of goal post to try to sort out some details. I think about missed opportunities, notably against Chelsea.” Former Montpellier forward Giroud, who made the switch to Emirates Stadium in 2012, is keen to review his performances and admits Arsenal boss Wenger is looking for him to develop into a more intelligent player. “I have to be more decisive in the box, but also in my way to keep the ball and defend,” he added. “You have to be demanding, trying to find peace in front of goal. “At least once a week I try to work in front of goal. I have been doing it systematically since I have been at Arsenal. I need it. “Arsene Wenger often gives me corrections after matches. We are talking about opportunities. “To him, I am not crafty enough. Once he told me I am too frank in my runs, too predictable. I have to be more confusing.”	sports

World Cup: England campaign ends with 0-0 draw against Group D winners Costa Rica | Football365 | Football Match Reports	Daniel Sturridge: Challenged by Oscar Duarte Roy Hodgson made nine changes to his starting line-up from the defeat against Uruguay, with the new-look side showing promise but suffering from many of the same failings which proved so costly in the 2-1 defeats by Italy and Uruguay. Daniel Sturridge, who had a strong first-half appeal for a penalty waved away, missed an excellent second-half chance to break the deadlock and there were several other promising opportunities which England could not take advantage of, while the defence looked occasionally shaky, with Chris Smalling particularly nervous. Ben Foster did well as Joe Hart’s replacement, tipping one first-half free-kick from Celso Borges onto the top of the crossbar, but he was less employed than opposite number Keylor Navas in Belo Horizonte, the scene of England’s infamous 1950 defeat to the USA. England's fans started off by cheering their team loudly, and the likes of Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana and the impressive Jack Wilshere responded with good performances. But by the end there was a flat feeling among the few thousand who had come to Estadio Mineirao and England head home having amassed just one point from their three matches - their worst points total in World Cup history. For the first minute and a half, Costa Rica's noisy fans shouted "Ole" as England chased shadows in the lunchtime heat. Within four minutes England were nearly behind. Randall Brenes found Joel Campbell on the edge of the box and his deflected looped up off Gary Cahill past Foster's goal. A few groans were heard as Smalling sliced a simple pass out of play. Cahill needlessly punted the ball out moments later. Finally, England came into the game courtesy of Wilshere, who beat two players and found Sturridge, but he dragged his shot just wide. Shaw, the youngest England player to start a World Cup game since Michael Owen, showed no sign of nerves going forward, but he gave away a free-kick in a dangerous position. Borges stepped up and bent a dipping shot over the wall and onto the bar via the fingertips of the athletic Foster. The only other point of note in the dull first period came just before the half hour when a Ross Barkley touched James Milner's cross into the path of Sturridge. The Liverpool striker shaped to shoot, but Duarte brought him down with an out-stretched leg. Referee Djamel Haimoudi waved play on, much to Sturridge's dismay. Fortune favoured England in a move straight after the break. Shaw's shot looped straight into the path of Sturridge in the box, but the striker mis-controlled, allowing Costa Rica goalkeeper Navas to smother the ball. Giancarlo Gonzalez dumped Barkley on the turf with a wrestling move, but Frank Lampard, appearing possibly for the last time in an England shirt, wasted the free-kick, driving straight into the wall. Phil Jones, a few minutes after failing to control a simple pass, then gave possession away inside his own half, but luckily for England Christian Bolanos shot straight at Foster. Wishere played a lovely one-two with Sturridge to set the striker free inside the box, but he curled an inch wide. Hodgson tried to inject some life into his team by introducing Raheem Sterling. The England support then demanded Wayne Rooney enter the pitch. Instead they got Steven Gerrard, who was cheered by the fans, who suspected this might be the captain's final England appearance. Rooney finally came on with 15 minutes left. The Manchester United striker attempted an audacious chip over Navas within minutes of his introduction. He also came within inches of turning home Lampard's cross in the dying minutes. England kept on trying, but they could not beat Costa Rica - a team ranked below Scotland by FIFA.	sports

Not Too Late For Rodwell To Lead England | Football365 | Opinion | Mailbox	Latest Articles An interesting Mailbox with thoughts on player intelligence, Rio Ferdinand's last hurrah with 'Arry, inflated transfer fees and wanting England to lose against Costa Rica... It does seem a tad ridiculous. But it will allow Liverpool to build half a team. We have lots of mails on England really not being bad, Henderson for captain and more... If you have anything to say on any subject, mail us at theeditor@football365.com Get Jack Back It has been often said during this tournament that England have lacked a truly defensive midfielder/screening midfielder/ whatever the current preferred term might be. The tragedy is that back in 2011, England had exactly what we needed - a young, tenacious, exciting, strong, physical, defensively capable midfielder, who was also able to break forward and find a through ball when necessary. Unfortunately (for him and for England), rather than make his name in his preferred position at the club where he grew into his trade, he moved to a bigger club (for admittedly understandable reasons, both financial and professional). I am of course talking about Jack Rodwell moving from Everton to Man City. We'll never know whether Rodwell would have become the player he was tipped to become had he got regular match time for the last 3 seasons - but what we do know is that other players who became "lost" in a large squad at a big club, have gone on to revive their careers when given a more prominent role (for example, Daniel Sturridge). I guess this leads me to two conclusions - firstly, for England to have the best chance in 2016, we need players like Shaw, Lallana, Barkley, Wilshere, Stones and even Jones and Smalling (heaven help us all) to play regularly in their best positions. Jones and Smalling in particular are excellent examples of players touted for a bright future at Blackburn and Fulham, hoovered up by a bigger club, then marginalised and held out of their best positions (by Vidic and Ferdinand, admittedly). This has clearly led to a regression in their performances that cannot simply be explained away by the argument of "the larger the club, the more focus on the player". This leads me to my second conclusion, that all hope is not lost for such players if they are given the chance to play regularly. If Rodwell does (as expected) leave Citeh on loan (or permanently) during this summer, there is still the opportunity for him to become the player that we all hoped he could be three seasons ago. Rodwell is still only 23 - coincidentally, the same age as Sturridge when he signed for Liverpool - and has plenty of time to mature into the combative midfielder (and captain?) that England will sorely need in 2016. Equally, the departure of Vidic and Ferdinand may give Jones and Smalling the opportunity to grow into the central defensive partnership that United (and England) are crying out for (unless Van Gaal buys Ron Vlaar.) Perhaps it's the fact that I support a "small" club, but I sincerely hope that if England's current crop of promising youngsters that are linked with a high profile transfer do make the jump to United (Shaw) / Liverpool (Barkley, Lallana) / Chelsea (Stones), that they are given the competitive game time to continue their development - not just for their own benefit, but for that of the national side as well. Terry Hall, Switzerland England Would Be Special Why can't the FA just give Jose Mourinho a shed load of cash, and promise him a knighthood when he wins us the World Cup. Hodgson might be a lovely chap and have all the best intentions, but his football teams have never won anything. All the youth development in the world doesn't make a difference when the manager has no tactical awareness. England look completely devoid of ideas when playing and seem to have had little coaching in how to attack in the final third. To compound it, England set up to allow the opposition to settle into position before every attack commences. It made me sick recently when I read we nearly got Jose for England manager and we ended up with Capello. Imagine England at this tournament with Jose leading it - England certainly wouldn't be out yet. Everybody hates Jose, apart from Chelsea fans I imagine. If he was managing England and getting us to the World Cup final he would be a national hero. Jim (for the record, not a Chelsea fan), Canterbury Shape Of Things To Come This might have already been said - if not, it should have - but England are not going to get any better in the next two years unless things change. We're out of another competition and it's the same old story. In two years time, the situation will be exactly the same; we'll qualify relatively easily (one or two dodgy away matches aside) and go into the Euros in decent form. Some of our players will have had good domestic seasons and there will be a quiet optimism that we can perform well. Sound familiar? That's pretty much the story for almost every tournament since Euro 96. We always kid ourselves into believing that we're on the cusp of another "golden generation", as if to say: "Don't worry about this tournament lads, it's the next one that counts. You'll be better for this experience." But we won't, at least not until things change. We need to stop relying on the supposed quality of our players and start putting more emphasis on effective tactics and systems. Look at the Dutch team; how many of those players would you say are superstars? Robben and van Persie are really the only ones that fit the bill. Of the rest, you've got Leroy Fer (relegated last season), Krul, De Guzman, Vorm and Vlaar (finished 10th, 12th & 15th with Newcastle, Swansea & Villa respectively). Plus four from Feyenoord, who got knocked out in the playoffs of the Europa League. Yet see how well they play. They have got their game plan spot on - even without van Persie in the line-up they weren't affected; if anything they defended better. The same goes for teams like Chile, USA, Mexico, Ghana, Costa Rica, Columbia etc. (success being relative, of course). It doesn't matter how good we think Luke Shaw, Raheem Sterling, Phil Jones, Ross Barkley et al are going to be; if we don't get the system right, it's moot. You can have the best players in world football in your team but if you don't use them in the right way you're still going to struggle. Case in point, Portugal; they have the Ballon D'Or winner in their team, and they've only got one point, having scored just twice. It's time to start actually planning how to deal with the opposition - learning to exploit their weaknesses and defend against their strengths. Enough of just chucking whichever flavours of the week aren't injured into some random formation and hoping for the best. If it means dropping players like Rooney or Gerrard, or bringing in players from less "fashionable" teams then so be it. I'm not saying we have no chance in the Euros but unless lessons are learned from both other countries, and from this tournament in general, then it's all just a little bit of history repeating. Ted, Manchester Foster And Bentley Deserve Credit Usually I'm with Nick Miller when he writes columns but on this occasion I think he is so desperate to play devil's advocate to the accepted norm that he has confused his own argument. I agree that if a player doesn't feel pride in representing his country then he shouldn't force/fake it but equally he should make it clear that he does not want to be considered for selection rather than taking up a position that a player who wants to play could take. I have much more respect for a Ben Foster, even as with many fans I'll never understand why you wouldn't want to play, being honest about it and requesting he isn't selected than a player who accepts the call-up then doesn't bother or pulls out at every available opportunity. The Foster issue is also hugely different to David Bentley's situation. While few football fans could understand why a footballer would ever give up that life/career to many it is probably just a job that pays the bills and many of us hate our jobs, perhaps do a half-arsed job but go into work every day and pick up the pay cheque regardless. So I don't blame Bentley for that even if it would piss me off to see him continue to pick up a wage at my club and provide nothing in return. If he chooses not to even do that then he deserves some credit. To confuse either of these issues with Capello missing his son's wedding or a player wanting to miss an international because his partner is expecting is nonsense and Redknapp knew this when he stuck his oar in and Nick should see this as well and call it for the petty, pathetic score settling that it is. He wasn't appealing for paternity leave for footballers, he was kicking Hodgson and the FA when they were down. These are legitimate reasons for missing a game/work and should be treated as such so if any attitude needs to change it is for these reasons not dead grannies or fake injuries or lack of pride. Also what is with this 'Suarez has had one good season' nonsense that seems to be sneaking into the mailbox as if it is fact? The guy scored 23 goals two years ago to go with his 31 this year despite missing 10 games, that's 54 goals in 66 games. He has a one in two record at international level and was top scorer in the qualifying campaign having been named player of the tournament at the last Copa America and having an excellent 2010 World Cup. All that without including his phenomenal record at Ajax (as we all know goals in countries other than Spain, Germany, Italy, France and especially England do not count). The guy has been superb for at least the past four years and has been getting better and better year on year and the figures being rumoured are therefore absolutely fair. Regards, Lindsay, Melbourne. Neymar: He's Quite Good How good was Neymar last night?! Yes he scored two good goals, but the most impressive things I saw from him were: - Tireless running to chase down loose balls and pressurise defenders. He is clearly not a lazy flair player. - Tricks and flicks being attempted. Some came off - there was a brilliant little flick off the outside of his right foot as he pirouetted to the left at the end of the first half which almost set up an awesome goal. But it's the fact that he kept trying them that made me most impressed; no England players would have attempted a rainbow kick from just outside the box. - No f***ying about! He got a bit of a kicking, but was generally straight back up again. Didn't go to ground as easily as most players have been doing at this WC. I know it was 'only' Cameroon, but I thought he was ace. Ian (Aberdeen kick off their Europa League season next week, jeez!) Towns, MUFC Slow And Steady Wins The Race In response to Andy, London, who wrote in to highlight how the World Cup is usually won by a slow starter - I couldn't agree more. I have been evangelising this truth for the past weeks to a somewhat uninterested & stubborn audience. Most of my mates watched the first round of games and immediately concluded that the semi-finalists would be Holland, Brazil, Germany, Argentina. I too wondered if they have never watched a World Cup before. It's a hard concept to explain but it just almost always turns out that way. The thing with a tournament like the World Cup is that, firstly, it is just that - a tournament, and not a league. Five goals in your first game doesn't give you any advantage over a team that draws their first two games and scraps through by an own-goal in the third group game. Also, it is very difficult to keep up the type of pace Holland (for example) started with for seven games - heck its hard in any part of the world to go seven games unbeaten. You can lose one game in the first three and still survive, but losing one game in the last four is the end of the road. Hence, a team can't afford to have a bad game in the second two weeks, but can afford to have a bad game in the first two weeks, learn your mistakes and power on from there. Your opposition gets tougher as the tournament progresses too and someone will have studied your technique by the time you get to the QF/SF stage. The chances of injuries and suspensions increase and the loss of a key defender to suspension/injury just means one mistake from a newcomer playing their first game of the tournament means the end of a World Cup for you. There is no goal difference factor later. There are just so many variables involved - nine points from the first three games means very little. That said, it's been a belter of a World Cup.

James, Ireland Not Wanting England To Win Without wanting to be accused of treason and marched to the front door of a grieving family by Ian Wright, I think a convincing victory for England today could be the worst thing that could happen, and that's not just for the headline 'Costa Eureka!' that will adorn the papers tomorrow. Of course, it makes sense to always have half an eye on the next major tournament, and the expansion to 24 teams in the European Championships means that England should really never fail to qualify for it ever again, but much like any game of football, you should be picking your best players to get the job done. Tonight is a meaningless game for England and I can understand the experimentation, but should they win 3-0, that does not mean this is England's best team. The cry for this massively inexperienced team to carry on into the qualifiers for Euro 2016 will be deafening and I only hope Roy Hodgson has the sense about him to realise that actually, the team he picked for the first two games is, more or less, his best team, even if it wasn't utilised in the best manner. There are question marks of course, and as with any tournament, you would expect a couple of players to be phased out. Wholesale change though is not needed. Wholesale change has already happened in many respects when you look at this squad compared to that of even two years ago. Half the squad has changed already - that's major surgery! Many people seem to be pinning their hopes on the likes of Luke Shaw, who is a very good player but is still very young, and John Stones, who has a handful of impressive games for Everton under his belt. These guys may turn out to be wonderful players, but if they don't break into the England team until they're 22/23, that isn't the end of the world. Seriously, when will we learn? Leighton Baines, despite being 29, is still a relative newcomer to the international scene and deserves a chance to bed in. The same is true of the likes of Lallana, Henderson, Wilshere and even Jagielka and Cahill. Because of the longevity of the previous generation, we have a raft of players in their mid to late twenties with very little international experience. Any good team has the right mix of youth and experience. To throw the likes of Gerrard, Rooney (and dare I say it, Ashley Cole) on the scrap heap too early would be cutting off our nose to spite our face. Italy with Pirlo and Mexico with Marquez have both put extra players in certain areas on their team to allow their older players to continue to flourish, which is something Hodgson has neglected to do. Isn't something along those lines worthy of experimentation as much as filling the team full of kids who have thus far shown no signs of surpassing the people they are being lined up to replace? I think, as a nation, we are sorely mistaken if we think we have players of the quality of Gerrard, Lampard and Rooney coming through our ranks. If it forces us to focus on the collective rather than the individual then it's for the better, but forgive me if I remain sceptical on that one. Andy, London England had The Group Of Death Ever since the WC draw, Group G with Germany/Portugal/USA/Ghana has been dubbed the "group of death". At the time, I couldn't argue. As of December 6, 2013, Ze Germans were ranked 2nd, Portugal 5th, USA 14th and Ghana 24th. 45 total? That's ridiculous! Come the start of the World Cup, however, Despite Germany still being 2nd, Portugal up to 4th and USA up to 13th, Ghana had dropped to 37th. That's a combined total of 56. Uruguay at 7th, Italy at 9th, England at 10th and Costa Rica at 28th gives us a total of 54, the lowest combined ranking of any group. We were 6/7/13/31 for 57 at the time of the draw. I still hold onto some hope that we can beat Costa Rica today and save some face after playing the REAL Group of Death at this year's WC. Dickon, Sandford Send Them All To School With a country of 60 million people, amongst the highest paid players in the world, a smorgasbord of talent, why do we always fail dismally at international competition. To answer this, you must find the unique characteristic of the English footballer. And this is found at the heart, no the arse of this septic isle. The chav. The ignoramus who lionized Jade Goody (God rest her soul), the country that invented binge drinking, the nation with the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in Europe, the 'fan' who whilst not inventing football hooliganism, gave it that English touch; the English footballer is royalty amongst them all. This squad is dumb and getting dumber. Ask yourself how many players speak a foreign language ('Professor' Lampard's latin doesn't count). Most squads are bi-lingual and more. Why has no player in the Premiership come out as Gay, why do none of the squad play abroad? Why does an intelligent guy like Graeme Le Saux get hounded for reading the Guardian? The questions just pile up and the answer is always the same. Because the English footballer is dumb. Effectively taken from school at a young age, he is afraid of what's outside his comfort zone where his job on the pitch is drilled into him until thought is no longer required. And he has every right to be afraid because once he's playing for a different team and the opposition mixes it up a bit, changes their formation, plays with intelligence to maximize their qualities and expose deficiencies in the opposition, England players are left flat footed, literally and metaphorically - witness Gerrards utter lack of awareness of the gap on the left midfield and Rooney continuing to play where he does at Man U. Mercy! Glen Hoddle alluded to it with his plea for 'flexibility'. Lineaker alluded to it with his reference to Gerrards lack of 'football nous'.

Have you ever wondered why the English Rugby team is good (the pundit and ex hooker fercrisskes Brian Moore is a qualified solicitor - how many....no don't bother), the English cricket team was until recently the best.

Rio is joining the triffic lads down at Loftus Road. According to the papers he has taken a pay cut to join us and is on about 1/3 of his previous salary....so about £65,000 a week. Im trying to stay positive, and say the only reason he will be more motivated than the overpaid tripe we bought last time (Bosingwa, im looking at you) is that 'Arry gave him in his chance therefore he wouldn't want to let him down. And then i realise we've given £65,000 a week to a 35 year old - our four centre backs are C.Hill, R Dunne, R Ferdinand, N Onuoha -and if you take Onuhoa out and put these three in a foot race, you'd have to clear your weekend diary to see the winner finish. But not to worry - he's triffic. Smuggler McSmugglerson Worried About Inflated Fees I'm sure you will have seen a lot of this in the comments section recently but I am finding it hard to get my head around some of the transfer fees being touted this summer. I'm a Manchester United season ticket holder and whilst I'm delighted that we are looking to rebuild (any also with Van Gaal's promise at the World Cup) I cannot but be a little worried. £34m for a left back with only two years Premier League experience and no CL football reeks of a huge risk, and whilst I believe Herrera is a good player is he worth one and a half Ruud Van Nistelrooys? I used to remember getting extremely excited when a player was costing more than £20m, but now it seems it has to be the norm for anyone half decent. I understand inflation and the fact that Chelski and the oil money next door have somewhat driven up the costs, but with FFP in place I am slightly bemused - is anyone else?

Giving Rio £65,000 A Week. What Could Go Wrong? | Football365 | Opinion | Mailbox	Latest Articles Jack Rodwell can become the player England crave, according to one mailboxer. Others are enjoying Neymar and longing for Jose Mourinho as England boss... It does seem a tad ridiculous. But it will allow Liverpool to build half a team. We have lots of mails on England really not being bad, Henderson for captain and more... If you have anything to say on any subject, mail us at theeditor@football365.com We Got a Few Of These Terry Hall, Switzerland. Jack Rodwell England Captain in 2016? Are you on drugs? James, Ireland Not Wanting England To Win Without wanting to be accused of treason and marched to the front door of a grieving family by Ian Wright, I think a convincing victory for England today could be the worst thing that could happen, and that's not just for the headline 'Costa Eureka!' that will adorn the papers tomorrow. Of course, it makes sense to always have half an eye on the next major tournament, and the expansion to 24 teams in the European Championships means that England should really never fail to qualify for it ever again, but much like any game of football, you should be picking your best players to get the job done. Tonight is a meaningless game for England and I can understand the experimentation, but should they win 3-0, that does not mean this is England's best team. The cry for this massively inexperienced team to carry on into the qualifiers for Euro 2016 will be deafening and I only hope Roy Hodgson has the sense about him to realise that actually, the team he picked for the first two games is, more or less, his best team, even if it wasn't utilised in the best manner. There are question marks of course, and as with any tournament, you would expect a couple of players to be phased out. Wholesale change though is not needed. Wholesale change has already happened in many respects when you look at this squad compared to that of even two years ago. Half the squad has changed already - that's major surgery! Many people seem to be pinning their hopes on the likes of Luke Shaw, who is a very good player but is still very young, and John Stones, who has a handful of impressive games for Everton under his belt.

Not Too Late For Rodwell To Lead England | Football365 | Opinion | Mailbox	Latest Articles An interesting Mailbox with thoughts on player intelligence, Rio Ferdinand's last hurrah with 'Arry, inflated transfer fees and wanting England to lose against Costa Rica... It does seem a tad ridiculous. But it will allow Liverpool to build half a team. We have lots of mails on England really not being bad, Henderson for captain and more... If you have anything to say on any subject, mail us at theeditor@football365.com Get Jack Back It has been often said during this tournament that England have lacked a truly defensive midfielder/screening midfielder/ whatever the current preferred term might be. The tragedy is that back in 2011, England had exactly what we needed - a young, tenacious, exciting, strong, physical, defensively capable midfielder, who was also able to break forward and find a through ball when necessary. Unfortunately (for him and for England), rather than make his name in his preferred position at the club where he grew into his trade, he moved to a bigger club (for admittedly understandable reasons, both financial and professional). I am of course talking about Jack Rodwell moving from Everton to Man City. We'll never know whether Rodwell would have become the player he was tipped to become had he got regular match time for the last 3 seasons - but what we do know is that other players who became "lost" in a large squad at a big club, have gone on to revive their careers when given a more prominent role (for example, Daniel Sturridge). I guess this leads me to two conclusions - firstly, for England to have the best chance in 2016, we need players like Shaw, Lallana, Barkley, Wilshere, Stones and even Jones and Smalling (heaven help us all) to play regularly in their best positions. Jones and Smalling in particular are excellent examples of players touted for a bright future at Blackburn and Fulham, hoovered up by a bigger club, then marginalised and held out of their best positions (by Vidic and Ferdinand, admittedly). This has clearly led to a regression in their performances that cannot simply be explained away by the argument of "the larger the club, the more focus on the player". This leads me to my second conclusion, that all hope is not lost for such players if they are given the chance to play regularly. If Rodwell does (as expected) leave Citeh on loan (or permanently) during this summer, there is still the opportunity for him to become the player that we all hoped he could be three seasons ago. Rodwell is still only 23 - coincidentally, the same age as Sturridge when he signed for Liverpool - and has plenty of time to mature into the combative midfielder (and captain?) that England will sorely need in 2016. Equally, the departure of Vidic and Ferdinand may give Jones and Smalling the opportunity to grow into the central defensive partnership that United (and England) are crying out for (unless Van Gaal buys Ron Vlaar.) Perhaps it's the fact that I support a "small" club, but I sincerely hope that if England's current crop of promising youngsters that are linked with a high profile transfer do make the jump to United (Shaw) / Liverpool (Barkley, Lallana) / Chelsea (Stones), that they are given the competitive game time to continue their development - not just for their own benefit, but for that of the national side as well. Terry Hall, Switzerland England Would Be Special Why can't the FA just give Jose Mourinho a shed load of cash, and promise him a knighthood when he wins us the World Cup. Hodgson might be a lovely chap and have all the best intentions, but his football teams have never won anything. All the youth development in the world doesn't make a difference when the manager has no tactical awareness. England look completely devoid of ideas when playing and seem to have had little coaching in how to attack in the final third. To compound it, England set up to allow the opposition to settle into position before every attack commences. It made me sick recently when I read we nearly got Jose for England manager and we ended up with Capello. Imagine England at this tournament with Jose leading it - England certainly wouldn't be out yet. Everybody hates Jose, apart from Chelsea fans I imagine. If he was managing England and getting us to the World Cup final he would be a national hero. Jim (for the record, not a Chelsea fan), Canterbury Shape Of Things To Come This might have already been said - if not, it should have - but England are not going to get any better in the next two years unless things change. We're out of another competition and it's the same old story. In two years time, the situation will be exactly the same; we'll qualify relatively easily (one or two dodgy away matches aside) and go into the Euros in decent form. Some of our players will have had good domestic seasons and there will be a quiet optimism that we can perform well. Sound familiar? That's pretty much the story for almost every tournament since Euro 96. We always kid ourselves into believing that we're on the cusp of another "golden generation", as if to say: "Don't worry about this tournament lads, it's the next one that counts. You'll be better for this experience." But we won't, at least not until things change. We need to stop relying on the supposed quality of our players and start putting more emphasis on effective tactics and systems. Look at the Dutch team; how many of those players would you say are superstars? Robben and van Persie are really the only ones that fit the bill. Of the rest, you've got Leroy Fer (relegated last season), Krul, De Guzman, Vorm and Vlaar (finished 10th, 12th & 15th with Newcastle, Swansea & Villa respectively). Plus four from Feyenoord, who got knocked out in the playoffs of the Europa League. Yet see how well they play. They have got their game plan spot on - even without van Persie in the line-up they weren't affected; if anything they defended better. The same goes for teams like Chile, USA, Mexico, Ghana, Costa Rica, Columbia etc. (success being relative, of course). It doesn't matter how good we think Luke Shaw, Raheem Sterling, Phil Jones, Ross Barkley et al are going to be; if we don't get the system right, it's moot. You can have the best players in world football in your team but if you don't use them in the right way you're still going to struggle. Case in point, Portugal; they have the Ballon D'Or winner in their team, and they've only got one point, having scored just twice. It's time to start actually planning how to deal with the opposition - learning to exploit their weaknesses and defend against their strengths. Enough of just chucking whichever flavours of the week aren't injured into some random formation and hoping for the best. If it means dropping players like Rooney or Gerrard, or bringing in players from less "fashionable" teams then so be it. I'm not saying we have no chance in the Euros but unless lessons are learned from both other countries, and from this tournament in general, then it's all just a little bit of history repeating. Ted, Manchester Foster And Bentley Deserve Credit Usually I'm with Nick Miller when he writes columns but on this occasion I think he is so desperate to play devil's advocate to the accepted norm that he has confused his own argument. I agree that if a player doesn't feel pride in representing his country then he shouldn't force/fake it but equally he should make it clear that he does not want to be considered for selection rather than taking up a position that a player who wants to play could take. I have much more respect for a Ben Foster, even as with many fans I'll never understand why you wouldn't want to play, being honest about it and requesting he isn't selected than a player who accepts the call-up then doesn't bother or pulls out at every available opportunity. The Foster issue is also hugely different to David Bentley's situation. While few football fans could understand why a footballer would ever give up that life/career to many it is probably just a job that pays the bills and many of us hate our jobs, perhaps do a half-arsed job but go into work every day and pick up the pay cheque regardless. So I don't blame Bentley for that even if it would piss me off to see him continue to pick up a wage at my club and provide nothing in return. If he chooses not to even do that then he deserves some credit. To confuse either of these issues with Capello missing his son's wedding or a player wanting to miss an international because his partner is expecting is nonsense and Redknapp knew this when he stuck his oar in and Nick should see this as well and call it for the petty, pathetic score settling that it is. He wasn't appealing for paternity leave for footballers, he was kicking Hodgson and the FA when they were down. These are legitimate reasons for missing a game/work and should be treated as such so if any attitude needs to change it is for these reasons not dead grannies or fake injuries or lack of pride. Also what is with this 'Suarez has had one good season' nonsense that seems to be sneaking into the mailbox as if it is fact? The guy scored 23 goals two years ago to go with his 31 this year despite missing 10 games, that's 54 goals in 66 games. He has a one in two record at international level and was top scorer in the qualifying campaign having been named player of the tournament at the last Copa America and having an excellent 2010 World Cup. All that without including his phenomenal record at Ajax (as we all know goals in countries other than Spain, Germany, Italy, France and especially England do not count). The guy has been superb for at least the past four years and has been getting better and better year on year and the figures being rumoured are therefore absolutely fair. Regards, Lindsay, Melbourne. Neymar: He's Quite Good How good was Neymar last night?! Yes he scored two good goals, but the most impressive things I saw from him were: - Tireless running to chase down loose balls and pressurise defenders. He is clearly not a lazy flair player. - Tricks and flicks being attempted. Some came off - there was a brilliant little flick off the outside of his right foot as he pirouetted to the left at the end of the first half which almost set up an awesome goal. But it's the fact that he kept trying them that made me most impressed; no England players would have attempted a rainbow kick from just outside the box. - No f***ying about! He got a bit of a kicking, but was generally straight back up again. Didn't go to ground as easily as most players have been doing at this WC. I know it was 'only' Cameroon, but I thought he was ace. Ian (Aberdeen kick off their Europa League season next week, jeez!) Towns, MUFC Slow And Steady Wins The Race In response to Andy, London, who wrote in to highlight how the World Cup is usually won by a slow starter - I couldn't agree more. I have been evangelising this truth for the past weeks to a somewhat uninterested & stubborn audience. Most of my mates watched the first round of games and immediately concluded that the semi-finalists would be Holland, Brazil, Germany, Argentina. I too wondered if they have never watched a World Cup before. It's a hard concept to explain but it just almost always turns out that way. The thing with a tournament like the World Cup is that, firstly, it is just that - a tournament, and not a league. Five goals in your first game doesn't give you any advantage over a team that draws their first two games and scraps through by an own-goal in the third group game. Also, it is very difficult to keep up the type of pace Holland (for example) started with for seven games - heck its hard in any part of the world to go seven games unbeaten. You can lose one game in the first three and still survive, but losing one game in the last four is the end of the road. Hence, a team can't afford to have a bad game in the second two weeks, but can afford to have a bad game in the first two weeks, learn your mistakes and power on from there. Your opposition gets tougher as the tournament progresses too and someone will have studied your technique by the time you get to the QF/SF stage. The chances of injuries and suspensions increase and the loss of a key defender to suspension/injury just means one mistake from a newcomer playing their first game of the tournament means the end of a World Cup for you. There is no goal difference factor later. There are just so many variables involved - nine points from the first three games means very little. That said, it's been a belter of a World Cup. Lee (Scrap the Qatar idea and just have Brazil 2022) Moyo, Durban. Portugal: No Better Than Wales Loath as I am to defend our greasy friend, its fairly obvious that Ronaldo is not fully fit. The cross was a moment of magic which we all know he's capable of. Expect to see hissy fits galore from Bale in the Euro qualifiers with the quality of his team-mates play, as I'd have Wales on a par with Portugal, possibly better than them with Ramsey in the team.

Premier League: Southampton's Jay Rodriguez plans return from injury | Football365 | Premier League News	Jay Rodriguez says the prospect of facing former club Burnley in December is helping his motivation to return from injury as quickly as possible. Last Updated: 23/06/14 at 11:37 Post Comment Jay Rodriguez: Looking forward to Southampton’s game at Burnley The Southampton forward suffered a serious knee injury in April which ended his chances of going to the World Cup with England. The initial prognosis was that Rodriguez would be sidelined for around six months, and he has been pleased with the early part of his recovery. Rodriguez has now vowed to keep working hard in his rehabilitation to make sure he comes back quickly, and has set his sights on the trip to Turf Moor on 13 December as a game he does not want to miss. “I want to be able to be fit to play in that and go back to Burnley. That is certainly my aim,” he said in the Lancashire Telegraph. “I haven’t got a specific comeback date from injury and it is just about working through the phases at the moment. I think there are six phases to the recovery and when we get to stage six we can start looking at putting a timescale on it.  “But seeing the Burnley fixture in December definitely helps with motivation and I really want to play a part.  “It will be great to go back and see all the fans and be able to play at Turf Moor again and see some of the players and people at the club.  “The Burnley game was the first fixture I looked out for.  “I am starting to see some positives with me knee and I am feeling good about the recovery. Hopefully it will go to plan.”  Rodriguez is looking forward to working under Ronald Koeman when he returns to fitness, having seen the Dutchman take charge at St Mary’s following Mauricio Pochettino’s move to Tottenham Hotspur. “I met Ronald Koeman very briefly,” added Rodriguez. “He is obviously a legend in the game and played at the very highest level. I am excited about working with him. “He asked me how the injury was and how I was getting on. It was only a very brief chat but it was nice to be able to meet him.  “I can’t wait to get back training again and working with him and hopefully it will be a good move for Southampton to bring him in.” 	sports
World Cup: Frank Lampard unsure over England future after Costa Rica draw | News	Frank Lampard remains unsure over his international future after England’s World Cup campaign limped to a conclusion with a 0-0 draw against Costa Rica. Last Updated: 24/06/14 at 20:39 Post Comment Frank Lampard: Veteran midfielder captained England in 0-0 draw with Costa Rica The veteran midfielder, who will end his long association with Chelsea this summer, captained the side but could not lead them to victory over Costa Rica, who progress to the last 16 as Group D winners with England at the bottom of the table. With Lampard now 36, it is likely to have been his final World Cup appearance, but he insists he is yet to decide when he will call time on his career with the Three Lions. When asked about his future, he told ITV: "I don't know. I really enjoyed being involved and I love playing for my country, that's obvious. I am 36 and still doing it. "I feel fresh. If I feel I can offer something I will do but at the moment it is too soon to say." Lampard agreed with Roy Hodgson’s post-match assessment that England had been the better side and could have won the game comfortably had they taken the opportunities they created, while also paying tribute to the support of the travelling fans. He added: "It was a difficult game to approach. "I think we did everything we could do. We showed a bit of character, we prepared right for the last two days. Everyone knows how tough it's been. "It wasn't vintage but we had enough chances to win the game. I think we played some good stuff, bright stuff at times, and created enough chances to win. “We’re England, we expect more, they expect more and we didn’t deliver. England fans have been an absolute credit, it’s a shame we couldn’t do enough to take them through and give them a longer trip.”	sports
Hazard Still Guilty Of Flattering To Deceive | Mediawatch, Mailbox, Ref365, John Nicholson, Spanish Thing | Football365	Latest Articles Argentina were woeful for large periods of their last-16 tie against Switzerland, but once again a high-profile team just sneaked through. Must do (much) better... With Manchester United said to be in the market for another midfielder, Ian Watson looks at the five possible targets for Louis van Gaal... Such was the clamour over Belgium's 'golden generation' in the build-up to this tournament, it became difficult to make a subjective and unbiased estimation of exactly what we could, or should, expect from Marc Wilmots' side. Due to the pant-wetting over the country's footballing rise (along with Borussia Dortmund they instigated the use of the football 'hipster' renaissance), Belgium were backed into the position of fifth favourites despite having failed to qualify for five consecutive major tournaments following the 2002 World Cup. That seemed wildly optimistic. In truth, Belgium have been largely uninspiring in Brazil. They incredibly managed to take nine points from their three group games despite leading for a total of just 24 minutes, less than half the figure of eliminated Russia. However, he who laughs, laughs longest, and Belgium will take their place in the quarter-finals alongside the other seven group winners. It is still four wins from four. Having been given the kindest of group stage draws, there was hope that Belgium could ease their way into the tournament after an almost impeccable qualification record. In contrast to the above statistic, Belgium trailed for just 39 minutes (away in Croatia) throughout their entire qualification campaign to reach Brazil. Instead, there has been a distinct lethargy to all that the Belgians have attempted, particularly in an attacking sense, as Wilmots has rather been let down by some of his star players. Les Diables have relied on substitutes for three of their four goals, with defender Jan Vertonghen scoring the other. It may sound harsh given their lack of experience on this particular stage but, given that Belgium's five midfielders have moved for a combined £118million in the last two years, and 13 of Belgium's squad played in the Champions League last season, should we have expected more? These are no plucky underdogs, and the likes of Kevin de Bruyne, Dries Mertens, Axel Witsel and Romelu Lukaku have almost entirely flattered to deceive. Against USA, the pattern from the group stage continued. Belgium have a squad with far greater ability than their opposition, and yet scraped through. Had Chris Wondolowski been more measured when presented with a last-minute chance in normal time (and the assistant referee less flag-happy), it could have been an evening with an entirely different ending. Even when Belgium looked to have gained some breathing space in extra-time, the cliché of the Hollywood sports film threatened to create a 2014 soccer version of Mighty Ducks. It has been a glorious fortnight for football in America, and they signed off from the tournament in memorable fashion. At the epicentre of such Belgian disappointment sits Eden Hazard. In a tournament dominated by individuals acting as the catalyst for their team's success (Lionel Messi, Neymar, James Rodriguez), this was the opportunity for Hazard to shake off a season tinged with discontent at Stamford Bridge. It remains a chance yet to be seized. Jose Mourinho criticised Hazard in May for his apparent lack of work rate, and evident bugbear of the Portuguese coach. "He's not the kind of player ready to sacrifice himself 100 per cent for the team and his mates. I'm not happy." To make matters wors, those stinging words were mirrored before this tournament by his international manager. "He [Hazard] can do a lot for us, everyone knows that. Now I'm waiting to see it. I'm waiting for him to take hold of a match and impose himself, even if he's still young to be doing that." Both men are right to increase their demands of Hazard. Although he has been excellent in patches since his £32m move from Lille, this is a player that is no longer merely a prospect in football terms. He will turn 24 in January, and must now start producing on a continued basis. That may sound incredibly unforgiving, but Hazard in only judged by the standards that he has set himself. Speaking before the match on Tuesday, the player admitted that he wished to emulate the best. "I have looked at what the other stars have done and try to take as much inspiration from them as possible.Have I been impressed by Lionel Messi, Neymar and James Rodriguez? Of course I have. I know you will see the best Eden." It is not the first time Hazard has mentioned being considered as the best player in the world. "I realise that I can compete with Messi and Ronaldo in the near future, if I put in some more effort." There's that issue of work rate, again. Against USA, Hazard was continuously criticised for his lack of assistance for Jan Vertonghen at full-back. American substitute DeAndre Yedlin was prasied for his attacking endeavour, but his task was made easier by Hazard's constant refusal to track back will have infuriated his manager, especially as the one time he noticeably ran alongside, pressurised and eventually tackled his man, a chance for the sprightly Divock Origi was immediately created. To be spoken of in the same breath as the best, Hazard now needs to be grabbing not just matches but entire competitions by the scruff of the neck. Ronaldo's 17 goals helped Real Madrid finally achieve La Decima, whilst Messi has been at the heart of all that Argentina have accomplished during this World Cup. The same cannot be said of Belgium's no. 10, and a quarter-final tie with Argentina provides the ideal opportunity for part redemption. Daniel Storey - Follow him on Twitter	sports
Individual Brilliance Needs Support From The Sides | Mediawatch, Mailbox, Ref365, John Nicholson, Spanish Thing | Football365	Latest Articles Belgium continued their rather haphazard route through the competition with extra-time victory over USA, but Eden Hazard continues to be slightly uninspiring... With Manchester United said to be in the market for another midfielder, Ian Watson looks at the five possible targets for Louis van Gaal... This has been a noticeably peculiar World Cup in that the football on display has been both mesmerising and hugely exhilarating but, with just nine of the 64 matches remaining, Colombia are the only side that have played to their full potential. It has been a knockout stage in which the supposed favourites have stuttered and stalled, but still found a way. We have had seven last-16 ties so far, and seven group winners have progressed, Germany, Netherlands, France and Brazil all through to the quarter-finals despite concerning under-performance. On Tuesday, Argentina added their name to that list - battered, bruised and distinctly substandard. But through. In fact, this is perhaps one of the reasons that the tournament has been so enthralling. There is little more turgid than a tournament in which the group stage and early knockout ties are simply a prelude or dress rehearsal for the later matches, a sense that we must all wait for the grown-ups to come out and play. Whether it be through the deficiencies of the highest-profile teams or an improvement in the supposed 'weaker' sides, the fact that there have been so few one-sided matches has made for quite excellent viewing. Only three sides have lost games by more than three goals - Spain and Portugal accounted for two of these. With the occasional exception, every team has been forced to work for every goal, point and victory. Against Switzerland, Argentina were no different. Alejandro Sabella's side have wholly failed to impress throughout their four games so far, winning each by a single goal and largely thanks to the wonder of Lionel Messi. The magician scored four and assisted two of his country's six goals in the group stage, but a goal difference of +3 against the likes of Bosnia, Iran and Nigeria has left those at home thoroughly underwhelmed. It seems bizarre given the depth of quality contained within their attacking unit, but Argentina have lacked any meaningful attacking cohesion during their four games so far. The final ball has often been left wanting, and huge possession and territory has failed to produce enough clear-cut chances. Plenty of shots have been attempted, but far too few chances forcing excellent saves or last-ditch tackles have been created. It's hugely surprising given Argentina's threat in qualifying - they scored six more goals than any other South American side. There is little wrong with relying on the brilliance of one individual, particularly when he has the quality that Messi holds, but as the tournament progresses, this only gets harder to achieve as the opposition possesses greater quality. Switzerland were able to utilise Valon Behrami and Gokhan Inler as a man-marking pair, forcing Messi to drop deeper to pick up the ball. Messi actually touched the ball more often in the 90 minutes than in any of the other three matches, but his possession was permitted at arm's length. Of course such a Swiss ploy should have afforded Argentina's alternative forward options greater space, but unfortunately Sabella's supporting acts fluffed their lines yet again. The hamstring injury sustained by the entirely underwhelming Sergio Aguero allowed Ezequiel Lavezzi to seize an opportunity for a consistent starting spot in a team aiming for greatness, but the Paris St Germain forward proved himself an excellent mimic of Aguero - he was the epitome of disinterest and mediocrity. Lavezzi attempted to drift off the flank to search for the ball, but was a passenger for almost all of his 74 minutes on the field. However, whilst Lavezzi's listlessness was disappointing, the performance of Gonzalo Higuain was yet again mystifyingly lacklustre. Higuain was intended to be the spearhead of this potent attack, but has instead looked unfathomably blunt. The Napoli striker has had just three shots on target in the entire tournament - that's a damning statistic for a player with 24 goals for Napoli last season and nine strikes in qualifying, only one fewer than Messi himself. Like Fred for Brazil, there seems a worrying lack of movement from Argentina's no. 9, who completed just 18 passes in 120 minutes - it isn't as if he can claim to be doing his best work outside of the area. Even Angel Di Maria, so often Messi's understudy as inspiration-in-chief, was woefully off-kilter. His passing accuracy of 63% was worse than any other outfield player, and so often the Real Madrid midfielder appeared to make the wrong choice when in possession. His goal to win the game deep into extra-time was an accomplished finish, but that served only to act as a contrast of how second-rate his performance had otherwise been. Until now this has felt like a World Cup in which individuals have performed better than teams, with Neymar, Messi, James Rodriguez, Thomas Muller and Arjen Robben dragging their sides through adversity. Whilst picking a tournament winner still looks hugely difficult, the country that manages to yield more from their supporting acts will be in a favourable position to achieve glory. For Argentina, that means demanding more from some particularly frustrating forwards. Daniel Storey - Follow him on Twitter	sports
The Page That Thinks Twice | Football365 | Mediawatch	Latest Articles The Daily Mail exclusively reveal a new nationality for Morgan Schneiderlin, Martin Samuel argues that being English should not be a crime and Philippe Senderos is an unlikely hero... Just 'how close' did Cristiano Ronaldo come to winning the World Cup. This is certainly the day in Ronaldo's career that Mediawatch will remember... Note to Glenn Hoddle Al Jazeera: A Qatar-based broadcaster. Algeria: A country in North Africa with a team at the World Cup. Spot The Liverpool Fan How Antony Kastrinakis begins his report on France's last-16 victory in The Sun: 'PAUL POGBA showed Manchester United once again yesterday what a cock-up it was to let him go.' Rain On Your Wedding Day Mediawatch is sobbing while it's writing these words, but we do kind of, almost, possibly, agree-ish with Adrian Durham on MailOnline in his view that Liverpool are partly to blame for Luis Suarez's behaviour because they fed his ego (though we would not be so crass as to cite Bill Shankly). And then we read these words: 'The irony is that the points dropped in the games Suarez missed because of suspension at the start of last season cost Liverpool the title. That ban came back to bite Liverpool on the shoulder.' Erm, sorry, what? No Adrian, the points dropped in the final weeks against Chelsea and Crystal Palace - when Suarez was very much available - are clearly what cost Liverpool the title, which was only even vaguely in view because of the Uruguayan's goals. Remember when you smarmily wrote in November that 'if there is any justice and sentiment left in football, Liverpool will be champions come May'? Mentions of sticking by Suarez last summer having 'damaged the reputation of this special club' were oddly absent that particular day. Biting Hypocrisy Adrian Durham on Suarez, July 1: 'And then, just when it looked like Uruguay were going out of the tournament, frustration set in and Suarez's 'God status' was threatened. He lashed out, he regressed to childhood and bit an opponent. Again.' Adrian Durham on Gary Lineker at the 1986 World Cup, July 1: 'England were 2-1 down in the quarter-final to Argentina in 1986, and late in the game John Barnes sends over a delicious cross to give Lineker a golden chance to equalise. 'But desperate to protect his no yellow cards boast, he bottled it, and Argentina cleared. Lineker should have cheated: by that stage of the game every England player knew Diego Maradona had scored with his hand, so Lineker should have cheated too. Elbow the defender out of the way, or put the ball in with your hand - just do whatever it takes to get that ball over the line and keep England in the World Cup.' 'Do whatever it takes'? Like bite an opponent and maybe cause a reaction that could have won a match-saving penalty, perhaps? Gone But Not Forgotten The Daily Mirror have come up with an '11 who waved goodbye to the World Cup but wished they hadn't'. We would have been more impressed if they'd come up with the names of 11 players who were frankly chuffed it was all over. Easy Rider Mediawatch makes no apologies for once again quoting Martin Samuel from April 2013 when he wrote about Luis Suarez following his biting of Branislav Ivanovic: 'The FA is increasingly a rogue regime in need of monitoring. Flushed with the success of banning Luis Suarez for 10 games for an offence that previously received a yellow card, the FA wishes to further nail its other racist bogeyman: John Terry.' Fast-forward to July 2014 and Samuel writes in the Daily Mail that Suarez was 'given a pathetically easy ride from those in his camp' who argued against his latest FIFA ban. Note to Suarez defenders: You can only give him a 'pathetically easy ride' when you're trying to make a point about your beloved John Terry. What A Difference A Terrible Season Makes The sheer volume of words/nonsense being produced by Martin Samuel in Brazil gives us no choice but to once again turn to the Daily Mail with a sigh. This time it's Samuel on 'game-changer' Louis van Gaal, who will replace the 'forlorn' David Moyes at Manchester United. Samuel seems quite taken with Van Gaal and his fancy substituting ways, so it's worth quoting the final lines of his piece on the Dutchman in their entirety: 'Jose Mourinho is regarded as one of the most inspired game managers in football and Van Gaal is the coach who he says was his greatest influence. Ferguson, the man whose feats the Dutchman must aspire to as Manchester United manager, was never shy of the bold gesture either. 'In this way, already, Van Gaal seems a more natural fit than the instinctively cautious Moyes. United fell behind 20 times and recovered to win on four occasions under Moyes. By contrast, Holland have come back from behind three times already just at this World Cup. 'It would appear United have found their man.' Which is odd because Samuel was extremely vociferous in his support for the 'instinctively cautious' Moyes last year, largely because he was instinctively cautious. Oh, and British. The 2013 Samuel wrote: 'So is the Steady Eddie who produced this (Everton) team, often the antithesis of the risk-takers and game-makers of Manchester United, the man to succeed Ferguson at Old Trafford? Yes, he is; of course he is.' In the same piece, which bizarrely claimed that 'English football deserves' the Scot being appointed United manager, Samuel claimed that 'it is United's obligation to lead the way and halt this obsession with foreign as better'. A terrible year for United later...will Van Gaal halt your own obsession with 'British is better', Martin? Headlines Of The Day 'HERR FLICK' - The Sun on Andre Schurrle's cheeky finish.

However instead of trying to forget the fact that he came so close to scoring the last-minute winner that would have knocked out Brazil and sent an entire nation into despair, the Chile striker has had it immortalised forever in a tattoo on his back' - The Independent. Non-Football Story Of The Day A man walked into a bank and defecated out of his shorts several times. He was said to be middle-aged and well-to-do with a "calm but angry" look. Customer Garreth McCarthy said: "I was just queuing up, there were about a dozen customers there, and this guy walked in. He looked pretty well to do. He was a middle-aged man, in his 40s, wearing shorts and trainers, and he had a bald head. He didn't say anything at all, but you can tell from his face he looked angry . Staff shut the Barclays in Andover, Hants, while the mess was cleaned up. Garreth added: "I wasn't really paying attention until I noticed a foul, but unmistakable smell. I looked at the guy and he was just calmly walking around the bank - going to all the areas he could. It's quite clear what he was doing - he just had this calm but angry look on his face, as he walked around leaving special deposits on the floor. And then as calmly as he walked in he left. Staff didn't know what on earth had just happened. The stench was unreal." A Barclays spokesman declined to comment' - Daily Mirror. Thanks to today's spotter Joe Bingham.

Transfer news: Newcastle United sign Siem de Jong from Ajax | Football365 | Premier League News	Newcastle have completed the signing of midfielder Siem de Jong from Ajax on a six-year contract for an undisclosed fee. Last Updated: 01/07/14 at 23:15 Post Comment Siem de Jong: Dutchman joins Newcastle from Ajax The 25-year-old, who can also operate as a striker, wrapped up his move to the Magpies after leaving Ajax’s pre-season training camp in Austria to undergo a medical and agree personal terms. De Jong, who is seen as a replacement for Yohan Cabaye at St James’ Park, had one year remaining on his deal with the Dutch club but is keen to play in the Premier League. He has spent his entire career with Ajax, for whom he was appointed captain in summer 2012, and has played in the Champions League and Europa League. He has made six appearances for the Netherlands but is not part of the World Cup squad in Brazil.   His brother Luuk de Jong was on loan at Newcastle from Borussia Monchengladbach in the second half of last season but the Magpies decided against signing him on a permanent deal after he failed to impress. After putting pen to paper, Siem de Jong, who will cost £6million according to some reports, told Newcastle's official website: "It is great to have signed for Newcastle. It is a big club which my brother told me all about, so I already feel good here. "I had been at Ajax a long time and wanted a new challenge in a new environment and a new country. "Coming to Newcastle is a great opportunity and the chance to play for a club like this in the Premier League was one I could not turn down. "I am looking forward to starting training and meeting my new team-mates and hopefully we can have a successful season." Newcastle manager Alan Pardew said: "We are absolutely overjoyed to bring Siem to the club because he will give us intelligence in the final third and create goalscoring situations, which we lacked towards the end of last season. "It is a big signing for this club. Siem brings massive experience from Ajax, I think our fans are going to enjoy the way he plays and I cannot wait to start working with him."

Individual Brilliance Needs Support From The Sides | F365 Says	Latest Articles Belgium continued their rather haphazard route through the competition with extra-time victory over USA, but Eden Hazard continues to be slightly uninspiring... Should Joachim Low be concerned or are Germany just hoping to peak in time for the business end of the World Cup? Ian Watson isn't convinced... This has been a noticeably peculiar World Cup in that the football on display has been both mesmerising and hugely exhilarating but, with just nine of the 64 matches remaining, Colombia are the only side that have played to their full potential. It has been a knockout stage in which the supposed favourites have stuttered and stalled, but still found a way. We have had seven last-16 ties so far, and seven group winners have progressed, Germany, Netherlands, France and Brazil all through to the quarter-finals despite concerning under-performance. On Tuesday, Argentina added their name to that list - battered, bruised and distinctly substandard. But through. In fact, this is perhaps one of the reasons that the tournament has been so enthralling. There is little more turgid than a tournament in which the group stage and early knockout ties are simply a prelude or dress rehearsal for the later matches, a sense that we must all wait for the grown-ups to come out and play. Whether it be through the deficiencies of the highest-profile teams or an improvement in the supposed 'weaker' sides, the fact that there have been so few one-sided matches has made for quite excellent viewing. Only three sides have lost games by more than three goals - Spain and Portugal accounted for two of these. With the occasional exception, every team has been forced to work for every goal, point and victory. Against Switzerland, Argentina were no different. Alejandro Sabella's side have wholly failed to impress throughout their four games so far, winning each by a single goal and largely thanks to the wonder of Lionel Messi. The magician scored four and assisted two of his country's six goals in the group stage, but a goal difference of +3 against the likes of Bosnia, Iran and Nigeria has left those at home thoroughly underwhelmed. It seems bizarre given the depth of quality contained within their attacking unit, but Argentina have lacked any meaningful attacking cohesion during their four games so far. The final ball has often been left wanting, and huge possession and territory has failed to produce enough clear-cut chances. Plenty of shots have been attempted, but far too few chances forcing excellent saves or last-ditch tackles have been created. It's hugely surprising given Argentina's threat in qualifying - they scored six more goals than any other South American side. There is little wrong with relying on the brilliance of one individual, particularly when he has the quality that Messi holds, but as the tournament progresses, this only gets harder to achieve as the opposition possesses greater quality. Switzerland were able to utilise Valon Behrami and Gokhan Inler as a man-marking pair, forcing Messi to drop deeper to pick up the ball. Messi actually touched the ball more often in the 90 minutes than in any of the other three matches, but his possession was permitted at arm's length. Of course such a Swiss ploy should have afforded Argentina's alternative forward options greater space, but unfortunately Sabella's supporting acts fluffed their lines yet again. The hamstring injury sustained by the entirely underwhelming Sergio Aguero allowed Ezequiel Lavezzi to seize an opportunity for a consistent starting spot in a team aiming for greatness, but the Paris St Germain forward proved himself an excellent mimic of Aguero - he was the epitome of disinterest and mediocrity. Lavezzi attempted to drift off the flank to search for the ball, but was a passenger for almost all of his 74 minutes on the field. However, whilst Lavezzi's listlessness was disappointing, the performance of Gonzalo Higuain was yet again mystifyingly lacklustre. Higuain was intended to be the spearhead of this potent attack, but has instead looked unfathomably blunt. The Napoli striker has had just three shots on target in the entire tournament - that's a damning statistic for a player with 24 goals for Napoli last season and nine strikes in qualifying, only one fewer than Messi himself. Like Fred for Brazil, there seems a worrying lack of movement from Argentina's no. 9, who completed just 18 passes in 120 minutes - it isn't as if he can claim to be doing his best work outside of the area. Even Angel Di Maria, so often Messi's understudy as inspiration-in-chief, was woefully off-kilter. His passing accuracy of 63% was worse than any other outfield player, and so often the Real Madrid midfielder appeared to make the wrong choice when in possession. His goal to win the game deep into extra-time was an accomplished finish, but that served only to act as a contrast of how second-rate his performance had otherwise been. Until now this has felt like a World Cup in which individuals have performed better than teams, with Neymar, Messi, James Rodriguez, Thomas Muller and Arjen Robben dragging their sides through adversity. Whilst picking a tournament winner still looks hugely difficult, the country that manages to yield more from their supporting acts will be in a favourable position to achieve glory. For Argentina, that means demanding more from some particularly frustrating forwards. Daniel Storey - Follow him on Twitter	sports

Dani Alves: Germany humiliation will not stain our careers - Goal.com	The defender insists the Brazil players' careers will not be scarred by the embarrassing 7-1 thumping at the hands of Germany in the World Cup semi-final on Tuesday Dani Alves does not believe the Brazil players' careers will be stained by the humiliating 7-1 defeat to Germany in the World Cup semi-final on Tuesday. The hosts were crushed by Joachim Low's side and Alves, who was an unused substitute, insists the Selecao squad is made up of "champions" who will not be remembered for one humbling defeat in Belo Horizonte. "No, I don't believe it is a stain on our careers," Alves told SporTV.  "It won't be stained by a single match, or by the elimination. Our fight, and where we reached, nothing can stain this. "Football isn't just about one match. Competitions are made to compete, to try to go as far as you can. We were eliminated today, but in this group, there are only champions." Meanwhile, midfielder Willian was at a loss to explain how Brazil fell to such a humbling defeat after they conceded five first-half goals to the rampant Germans on the way to the worst defeat in the national team's history. Willian said: "Today is an inexplicable day to all of us. It's one of those inexplicable stories of football. Everything went right for Germany and wrong for us.

Germany boss Joachim Low urges calm after Brazil mauling - Goal.com	The Germany boss insists his side are focused on the final after their 7-1 win, claiming that the margin of victory did not reflect the actual difference between the sides Joachim Low refused to get carried away after Germany's 7-1 thumping of Brazil, insisting his side are already fully focused on the World Cup final. Germany produced a remarkable result on Tuesday, with Toni Kroos and Andre Schurrle scoring twice and Thomas Muller, Miroslav Klose and Sami Khedira all adding to the tally as they stunned the hosts in Belo Horizonte. However, though acknowledging the clinical nature of the display, Low was quick to stress that this was not the time to be carried away with how his team played and even hinted that the size of the victory flattered Germany. "We have great feelings and great emotions, we have won and we will play the final," the 54-year-old told a press conference. "It's a good feeling, now we will have to be humble and prepare well for the final and take the next step. "We know how good the Brazilian team are. It's a big result but doesn't reflect the difference in the two teams. Today was our day and we are happy to be in the final. "They tried to show a reaction at the end and please their fans. There is happiness in the dressing room but we won't be going over the top. "It will be important now for the players to recover, regain their strength. We will remain calm. The team is calm and there is no euphoria in the dressing room. It's going to be difficult in the final, but we will be focused and concentrated on our objective over the next few days." Low also expressed his sympathy with the Selecao, likening their dismal defeat to Germany's semi-final loss to Italy in 2006 when they hosted the tournament. "The Brazilian team were under shock," he continued. "They have magnificent players, but in a semi-final if you get so many goals against you it's very hard. They were getting nervous and playing long balls into our defence. "I think I can imagine what was felt by the Brazilians. In 2006, in our home country, we missed the opportunity to make the final. "It was a big disappointment for us and it's the same for any country. This defeat for Brazil will be difficult to digest. Brazil organised a sensational World Cup, has fantastic, friendly people - and it will be difficult to digest for them." Finally, the Nationalelf boss paid tribute to striker Miroslav Klose, who became the all-time World Cup top scorer with his goal. "What Klose has achieved is something really great, the most goals in the history of the World Cup," he added. "He really deserves it and at his age he is still playing at the highest level. He is still dangerous and still scores goals. The only one who will beat him now is Muller - and that's a great thing for me and for the team."	sports

Netherlands have their own Messi in Robben - Sabella - Goal.com	The Argentina coach is wary of the threat posed by the Bayern Munich winger, who he says is as key for Oranje is as the 27-year-old is for the South Americans Arjen Robben is as important to Netherlands as Lionel Messi is to Argentina, according to Alejandro Sabella. The two stars will come head to head in Sao Paulo in the World Cup semi-finals on Wednesday night as their respective nations battle it out to meet Germany in Sunday’s final. And Sabella insists that Messi remains the better player, but says the Dutch could be just as buoyed by the form of Robben as his own side will be by the four-time Ballon d’Or winner. “He is a very dangerous player when one against one, so we have to pay special attention to him. When he gets a bit of speed up, it is more difficult to take away the ball from him,” Sabella told a press conference on Tuesday. “I think he is a great player, very important for Netherlands, like Neymar is to Brazil or Messi for Argentina. But Messi is the best of them all.” Wednesday’s fixture will represent Argentina’s first World Cup semi-final appearance in 24 years, but Sabella claims there will be no greater pressure on his side than usual. “The pressure is always there. [Getting to the semi-finals] was an extra pressure, I have no doubt. Now it’s a different kind of pressure. “We enjoyed the quarter-final win over Belgium for a short moment, but we have to save energy, the celebrations have to be modest and we have to think about recovering strength because this goes on and it becomes more difficult.” Some have painted the match as an opportunity for Argentina to gain revenge for their quarter-final loss to Netherlands in 1998, but the coach insists there will be no such talk from him. “Those are ugly words, revenge and vengeance, especially vengeance. This is football and those words are not in my dictionary.” The clash at the Arena Corinthians kicks off at 22:00CET on Wednesday.	sports
It's the worst day of my life - Scolari left stunned by Brazil thrashing - Goal.com	The 65-year-old took responsibility for his side's shock semi-final collapse at the hands of Germany, which he described as a defeat of "catastrophic proportions" Brazil boss Luiz Felipe Scolari said he had experienced the worst day of his life after seeing his side lose 7-1 at home to Germany in their World Cup semi-final at Estadio Mineirao on Tuesday. Scolari had claimed prior to the match that his team could cope without the injured Neymar and suspended skipper Thiago Silva, but Brazil soon capitulated against Joachim Low's men and found themselves 5-0 down after half an hour. "It's the worst day of my life," Scolari said after the game. "We ask for forgiveness for the result and we thank the fans for their support even during this defeat." And he added: "I am responsible for the catastrophic result. I made the choices. I am responsible. After the first goal went in we became disorganised and after that it was one goal after another. There was no time to change anything. "This is a loss of catastrophic proportions, it's the worst loss in our history, but we have to learn how to deal with it." Scolari says Neymar's absence had nothing to do with the defeat and admitted that Germany had just been better than his side. "Neymar is one of the team, but he is a striker and he wouldn't have helped us defend those moves," the Brazil boss said. "There's no reason to think it would have been different with Neymar. "Let's not try to find an excuse with Neymar. What happened is that Germany imposed themselves in a few moments which defined the match. Germany made use of those moments and it's nothing to do with Neymar." The 65-year-old now hopes his players can pick themselves up in time for Saturday's match for third and fourth place against either Argentina or Netherlands. "I will have to wait until Saturday to see how they will react," he said. "Before that we will look at this match again to see what went wrong and how we can improve, Life goes on."	sports

Best World Cup performance ever? Brazil humiliated themselves, not Germany - Goal.com	COMMENT: Germany are receiving all the plaudits after their 7-1 thumping of hosts Brazil in Belo Horizonte. But the truth is that Brazil inflicted this humiliation on themselves By Carlo Garganese Germany’s 7-1 thrashing of Brazil on Tuesday will go down as arguably the most stunning result in World Cup history. World Cup semi-finals are almost always very tight and tense affairs. The last time a last-four clash was won by more than one goal in 90 minutes was 28 years ago when Diego Maradona led Argentina to a 2-0 success over Belgium at Mexico ’86. Before the game, Brazil were marginal favourites – despite losing their two best players, Neymar and Thiago Silva, to injury and suspension respectively. They had not lost a competitive game at home since 1975 and with the whole country behind them it seemed that nothing could stop the Selecao in their quest for a sixth world title. For Germany to not only beat Brazil in their own backyard, but to register one of the highest margins of victory at a World Cup finals is almost impossible to believe. "That was football from another galaxy," gushed DFB president Wolfgang Niersbach. But how much credit do Germany really deserve? Granted, Joachim Low got his tactics spot on with Germany’s pressing and counter-attacking picking Brazil apart time and again. Low must also be praised for swallowing his pride after the second round scare against Algeria and restoring Philipp Lahm to his rightful position at full back. The decision to drop Per Mertesacker further tightened the backline. Germany were ruthless in the attacking third – bringing back memories of the great West German sides of the seventies and eighties when the likes of Gerd Muller, Wolfgang Overath and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge would show opponents no mercy. Thomas Muller and new World Cup record scorer Miroslav Klose certainly fall into a similar category. Hips don't lie | David Luiz had a nightmare in defence alongside Dante But the hard truth is that the reason why Germany inflicted such a humiliation on their hosts was because Brazil were an utter shambles. Sunday League players would be ashamed to perform at such an abominable level. Germany did not have to work for their goals – they were given to them. David Luiz and Dante may as well have been wearing white shirts so embarrassing was their defending on almost all of the seven strikes. Fernandinho gifted Toni Kroos his first goal straight from the restart as if it had been pre-planned. “You have to give Germany credit, but the truth is that it was a woeful, woeful performance from Brazil. In 40 years I have never seen anything like it,” Liverpool legend Alan Hansen, who played against Tele Santana's wonderful Brazil side of Zico, Socrates and Falcao at the 1982 World Cup, told the BBC. Had the Europeans dismantled an outstanding opponent, then they would deserve every superlative thrown their way. But this is the most talentless Brazil team that has ever appeared at a World Cup. A Brazil squad whose two centre-forwards are Fred and Jo. A squad whose right back, Maicon, is so past-it that he is left gasping for breath after the first five minutes. A squad with midfielders, like Ramires and Paulinho, who can't even pass the ball five yards square. A squad containing reserves from QPR, Napoli and Spurs. A squad which includes a host of sub-par players who were picked by Luiz Felipe Scolari solely for personal rather than professional reasons. Die Mannschaft deserve credit for such an historic result, and this golden generation of Bastian Schweinsteiger, Lahm and Klose certainly merits a trophy before they retire, but let’s get real – the big story here is that Brazil were an embarrassment.

Thomas Muller hails 'crazy' Brazil thrashing - Goal.com	The Germany forward was ecstatic with his team's semi-final performance as they inflicted a humiliating 7-1 defeat on the World Cup hosts in Belo Horizonte Thomas Muller could not hide his delight with Germany's 7-1 victory over Brazil in the World Cup semi-finals, describing the result as "crazy." Germany launched an onslaught with a flurry on first-half goals, Muller opening the scoring before Miroslav Klose, Sami Khedira and two from Toni Kroos left the hosts trailing 5-0 at half-time. Andre Schurrle added two more after the break and, though Oscar managed to grab a consolation for the Selecao, Muller could not disguise his shock at such a remarkable victory.

Brazil played differently than defensive teams and we took advantage of this in an extraordinary way. It was just crazy." However, as Germany look forward to a final with either Argentina or Netherlands at the Maracana on Sunday, the Bayern Munich forward urged his team-mates not to get carried away.

Best World Cup performance ever? Brazil humiliated themselves, not Germany - Goal.com	COMMENT: Germany are receiving all the plaudits after their 7-1 thumping of hosts Brazil in Belo Horizonte. But the truth is that Brazil inflicted this humiliation on themselves By Carlo Garganese Germany’s 7-1 thrashing of Brazil on Tuesday will go down as arguably the most stunning result in World Cup history. World Cup semi-finals are almost always very tight and tense affairs. The last time a last-four clash was won by more than one goal in 90 minutes was 28 years ago when Diego Maradona led Argentina to a 2-0 success over Belgium at Mexico ’86. Before the game, Brazil were marginal favourites – despite losing their two best players, Neymar and Thiago Silva, to injury and suspension respectively. They had not lost a competitive game at home since 1975 and with the whole country behind them it seemed that nothing could stop the Selecao in their quest for a sixth world title. For Germany to not only beat Brazil in their own backyard, but to register one of the highest margins of victory at a World Cup finals is almost impossible to believe. "That was football from another galaxy," gushed DFB president Wolfgang Niersbach. But how much credit do Germany really deserve? Granted, Joachim Low got his tactics spot on with Germany’s pressing and counter-attacking picking Brazil apart time and again. Low must also be praised for swallowing his pride after the second round scare against Algeria and restoring Philipp Lahm to his rightful position at full back. The decision to drop Per Mertesacker further tightened the backline. Germany were ruthless in the attacking third – bringing back memories of the great West German sides of the seventies and eighties when the likes of Gerd Muller, Wolfgang Overath and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge would show opponents no mercy. Thomas Muller and new World Cup record scorer Miroslav Klose certainly fall into a similar category. Hips don't lie | David Luiz had a nightmare in defence alongside Dante But the hard truth is that the reason why Germany inflicted such a humiliation on their hosts was because Brazil were an utter shambles. Sunday League players would be ashamed to perform at such an abominable level. Germany did not have to work for their goals – they were given to them. David Luiz and Dante may as well have been wearing white shirts so embarrassing was their defending on almost all of the seven strikes. Fernandinho gifted Toni Kroos his first goal straight from the restart as if it had been pre-planned. “You have to give Germany credit, but the truth is that it was a woeful, woeful performance from Brazil. In 40 years I have never seen anything like it,” Liverpool legend Alan Hansen, who played against Tele Santana's wonderful Brazil side of Zico, Socrates and Falcao at the 1982 World Cup, told the BBC. Had the Europeans dismantled an outstanding opponent, then they would deserve every superlative thrown their way. But this is the most talentless Brazil team that has ever appeared at a World Cup. A Brazil squad whose two centre-forwards are Fred and Jo. A squad whose right back, Maicon, is so past-it that he is left gasping for breath after the first five minutes. A squad with midfielders, like Ramires and Paulinho, who can't even pass the ball five yards square. A squad containing reserves from QPR, Napoli and Spurs. A squad which includes a host of sub-par players who were picked by Luiz Felipe Scolari solely for personal rather than professional reasons. Die Mannschaft deserve credit for such an historic result, and this golden generation of Bastian Schweinsteiger, Lahm and Klose certainly merits a trophy before they retire, but let’s get real – the big story here is that Brazil were an embarrassment.

Thomas Muller hails 'crazy' Brazil thrashing - Goal.com	The Germany forward was ecstatic with his team's semi-final performance as they inflicted a humiliating 7-1 defeat on the World Cup hosts in Belo Horizonte Thomas Muller could not hide his delight with Germany's 7-1 victory over Brazil in the World Cup semi-finals, describing the result as "crazy." Germany launched an onslaught with a flurry on first-half goals, Muller opening the scoring before Miroslav Klose, Sami Khedira and two from Toni Kroos left the hosts trailing 5-0 at half-time. Andre Schurrle added two more after the break and, though Oscar managed to grab a consolation for the Selecao, Muller could not disguise his shock at such a remarkable victory. "Of course, you couldn't expect that," the 24-year-old told ZDF. "That shows how different games can be. Brazil played differently than defensive teams and we took advantage of this in an extraordinary way. It was just crazy."

For Big Phil, read Big Flop: How could a respected coach get it so wrong? - Goal.com	COMMENT: The Brazil boss must take responsibility for what is probably the most embarrassing defeat in the nation's entire history, eclipsing even the Maracanazo By Ben Hayward in Belo Horizonte When Argentina lost 4-0 to Germany at the 2010 World Cup, Diego Maradona was accused of a naive tactical approach against one of the strongest sides in the competition. But what happened to Brazil at home to Joachim Low's men on Tuesday night was much, much worse. Everything that could go wrong did go wrong and for all the Brazilian bravado about being able to cope without their two best players, the starting XI looked decidedly ordinary sans Neymar and Thiago Silva. For all the talk of Brazil's quality in defence, their back line was picked apart at will. The first goal was a gift as awful marking allowed Thomas Muller to arrive late and score from a corner. With Thiago Silva in the side, that may never have happened, but the captain was out after picking up a needless yellow card against Colombia. Not even he could have imagined how costly that would be. In his absence, Dante came in alongside David Luiz, but the back line were defending far too high up the pitch. With Neymar, Scolari had seemed content for his team to defend deep and attack on the break. But against Germany, they played a high line which was easily exploited by Low's attackers, while huge holes in the midfield allowed the Europeans the freedom of the Mineirao pitch. What's going on? | Brazil in disbelief as Germany celebrate Brazilian fans watched in shock and horror as 0-1 became 0-2, 0-3, 0-4 and 0-5 in the space of six minutes. Disbelief turned to depression inside Belo Horizonte's superb stadium; with less than half an hour gone, Brazil's dreams of lifting the World Cup at home were in tatters. The players left the pitch amid a chorus of jeers at half-time and whatever Scolari said at the break, it had some impact as Brazil began brightly. But beating Manuel Neuer proved much more difficult than finding a way past Julio Cesar and the Bayern keeper made two superb saves to deny the home team. Brazil's revival didn't last long anyway as substitute Andre Schurrle made it six and then seven, before a late consolation from Oscar which still received the biggest cheer of the night - probably pent-up tension and anger. But this was a reverse of epic proportions, a loss to replace the Maracanazo in the history of the Selecao's most damaging defeats. A Mineirazo. And it's all down to Scolari. The Brazil boss must take the blame for most of what went wrong. Ask any Brazilian to name the nation's best goalkeeper and very few will say Julio Cesar, a player recently struggling at QPR. Then there was the absence of Atletico Madrid's in-form defender Joao Miranda and the clumsy handling of the Diego Costa case which saw Brazil lose perhaps their one world-class centre-forward to Spain. With Neymar out, Ronaldinho would have been useful too - even at the age of 34. He is a player who can provide a spark out of nothing - and Brazil have very few of those right now. The five-man midfield was woeful as Oscar dropped deep and was unable to get the ball, Hulk lost possession and added little defensively, while Bernard did absolutely nothing to show why Scolari had chosen him to stand in for Neymar. Paulinho, meanwhile, looks a million miles from the player who shone last summer in the Confederations Cup. In terms of personnel, in terms of tactics and in terms of man-management, Scolari got it all wrong. Brazil buckled under the psychological pressure of playing a World Cup at home and Felipao had called on the help of a psychologist as his footballers frequently broke down in tears, burdened by the immense weight of a nation's hopes and dreams. Tomorrow they will need the psychologist's help and so, quite probably, will their coach after the saddest possible ending to a World Cup they were supposed to win. Follow Ben Hayward on	sports

David Luiz: I am so sorry – I only wanted to make Brazilians happy - Goal.com	The hosts were humiliated as they slumped to a shocking 7-1 defeat to Germany in the World Cup semi-final in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday David Luiz has apologised "to all Brazilians" for the humiliating 7-1 defeat to Germany in the World Cup semi-final in Belo Horizonte. Brazil's dreams of winning the tournament as hosts were smashed as they slumped to an embarrassing defeat. Germany blew Luiz Felipe Scolari's men away as they took a 5-0 lead in the first half before sealing the emphatic 7-1 scoreline after the break. David Luiz, who was named captain in the absence of the suspended Thiago Silva, could only offer an apology at full-time for an abject personal and collective performance. "I just wanted to give some happiness to my people. To my people, who suffer so much already," Luiz told Rede Globo. "Unfortunately we couldn't do it. I'm sorry, everyone. Sorry to all Brazilians. I wanted to see my people smiling. "Everyone knows how important it was for me to make the Brazilian people happy, even if just because of football." Goalkeeper Julio Cesar echoed Luiz's apology and felt the Brazil players became "lost" during a dramatic opening 45 minutes. "I think we got a little lost there and Germany noticed we were like that and managed to score the goals," said Cesar. "I'd rather we had lost 1-0 because of my mistake. “To explain what happened now is complicated. This is a dream that ends, although not the way we hoped. "In my life, I've learned to be a man at all times. I won't shy away from anything, I'll take it on the chin. One day I'll give happiness to those people."	sports

Just like watching Brazil - Famous World Cup humiliations - Goal.com	After the Selecao suffered a chastening capitulation in their semi-final with Germany, Goal takes a look back at teams that have seen similar embarrassment on the World Cup stage By Andrew Wychrij As World Cup hosts, Brazil could be forgiven for struggling to handle the weight of expectation placed on their shoulders in Tuesday's semi-final. However, few would have predicted a remarkable first-half collapse against Germany. Joachim Low's side scored five goals in just 18 minutes on the way to securing a 7-1 win, silencing the Belo Horizonte crowd and ended Brazilian hopes of lifting the trophy for a sixth time. That said, Luiz Felipe Scolari's Selecao are far from the first side to endure the disgrace of a thrashing at international football's most prestigious event. Germany 8-0 Saudi Arabia, 2002 Germany recorded their biggest ever World Cup win with an 8-0 thumping of a desperately poor Saudi Arabia. Miroslav Klose scored a hat-trick, as Michael Ballack, Carsten Jancker, Thomas Linke, Oliver Bierhoff and Bernd Schneider all joined in the rout. Germany had 15 shots on target; their opponents had none. The defeat set the tone for both teams’ tournaments, as Rudi Voller's side went on to be beaten 2-0 in the final by Brazil and the Saudis exited at the group stages after losing to Cameroon and the Republic of Ireland. The 8-0 scoreline represented the worst loss by a team in the World Cup since 1982 and the largest margin of defeat without scoring a goal since 1974. Saudi Arabia’s -12 goal difference was the third worst goal in World Cup history, equalling El Salvador’s showing in 1982. Head coach Nasser Al Johar was sacked following the tournament. Hungary 8-3 West Germany, 1954 From 1950, Hungary boss Gusztav Sebes instilled a ruthless streak in the Magyars' game. Their attacking 3-2-1-4 formation saw them play 50 games between 1950 and 1956, winning 42, drawing 7 and losing just once. Hungary had begun their World Cup campaign in Switzerland with a 9-0 defeat of South Korea and found West Germany barely more of a contest in their second game. The Mighty Magyars lived up to their formidable reputation by thrashing an admittedly unseeded and weakened West German side. Sandor Kocsis scored four, ending the World Cup as top scorer with eleven, Nandor Hidegkuti got two and Ferenc Puskas and Jozsef Toth added the remainder. Hungary have long held a place in the pantheon of the greatest teams to ever play the game and demonstrated that in Switzerland, only blemishing that impression with a defeat in the final to the previously vanquished West Germany. West Germany 6-1 Austria, 1954 After wobbling against Hungary, West Germany only managed to escape the group stages after a 7-2 play-off win over Turkey. However, Sepp Herberger’s side had apparently been rejuvenated after their earlier humiliation. Following a 2-0 defeat of Yugoslavia in the quarter-finals, the West Germans turned their attention to their neighbours Austria and dished out an impressive display. Inspired by Max Morlock, they completed a reversal in fortunes by scoring six with Hans Schafer, Ottmar Walter, two penalties from Fritz Walter and one from Morlock himself. They progressed to the final where it appeared that the Hungarians were an unstoppable force en route to the Jules Rimet trophy. However, West Germany triumphed against their illustrious opponents, despite being 2-0 down after only eight minutes. The ‘Miracle of Bern’ as the game came to be known saw a historic 3-2 turnaround as the West Germans won their first ever World Cup. Yugoslavia 9-0 Zaire, 1974 Zaire entered the World Cup in West Germany with high hopes. Promoted and bankrolled by Zairean dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, the Leopards were African Cup of Nations champions and the first sub-Saharan side to make it to the prestigious arena of the World Cup. However, after an opening 2-0 defeat to Scotland, Zaire conspired to put in an awful display. 3-0 down after less than 20 minutes, an ignoble loss was likely to be on the cards. Dusan Bajevic starred as he grabbed three goals for the Blues and consigned the team coached by his fellow countryman, Blagoje Vidinic, to a heavy loss in Gelsenkirchen. Zaire’s miserable tournament was brought to an end after a 3-0 defeat to Brazil, leaving them without a point, without a goal and a goal difference of -14, an all-time low that only South Korea’s -16 in 1954 have managed to do worse than. Zaire’s 1974 remains a low point for African football in the tournament. On the face of it, Argentina’s 6-0 thumping of Peru in 1978 could be heralded as one of the most incredible results in the tournament’s history. The reality, however, was considerably murkier. The Peruvians were reigning Copa America champions and the Albiceleste needed an improbable 4-0 win to reach a World Cup final on home soil. The second-round game in Rosario saw them surpass even that milestone. Mario Kempes and Leopoldo Luque scored twice and Alberto Tarantini and Rene Houseman grabbed one each as the South Americans sealed a miraculous victory on the way to defeating the Netherlands in the final. Far from being regarded as a humbling defeat, the game is a far more serious humiliation amid accusations that Argentinian dictator Jorge Videla and Peru’s then-president Francisco Bermudez had struck a deal. The game has been mired in controversy ever since, considered by some as the World Cup’s biggest ever fix.	sports
Mats Hummels and Toni Kroos call for focus on final after Brazil World Cup thrashing - Goal.com	The Germany defender insists there will be no wild celebrations after their destruction of Brazil and has called on his team-mates to focus quickly on the final Mats Hummels has urged Germany to focus on securing a fourth World Cup, claiming that there will be no overexcitement over beating Brazil. Germany earned an incredible 7-1 win over the tournament hosts in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday, with Toni Kroos and Andre Schurrle scoring twice and Thomas Muller, Miroslav Klose and Sami Khedira adding to the scoresheet before Oscar's consolation. However, Hummels stressed that, since Germany knew they had won the game early on, they experienced a sense of calm at the final whistle and are already fully concentrating on the next fixture. "We think of it now, enjoy it and show our best on Sunday," the 25-year-old defender told reporters. "It was surprisingly quiet. You can also say without being arrogant - we have known for over an hour that we are through and that is different from tight games when you feel high emotion at full-time. "This is really something special, what each individual has done. And we will now try with everything we have to have to make the big dream come true." Toni Kroos echoed the thoughts of his compatriot, stressing that the final was now the sole concern despite the impressive result against the Selecao. "We have played a great game, we have almost overrun them at the beginning," he said. "We have had an incredible game but another game is still waiting. We are here to win the World Cup, we are not yet there."	sports

Maradona: I learned a lot from 'maestro' Di Stefano - Goal.com	The Argentina great has joined the chorus of praise for his late compatriot, revealing the deep impression that the legendary footballer made on his own career Diego Maradona has paid tribute to Alfredo Di Stefano, hailing the Real Madrid icon's impact upon his own career. The 88-year-old Argentinian, who passed away on Monday following cardiac arrest, enjoyed a glittering career in football, winning eight La Liga titles and five European Cups in 11 seasons with los Blancos. Maradona spent two seasons at Madrid's great rivals Barcelona, who had initially claimed to have signed Di Stefano when he arrived in Spain in 1953, and the former forward revealed how influential his  compatriot had been on his own career. "For me he was a maestro, he taught me a lot," the 53-year-old said on Telesur programme 'De Zurda'. "I remember a lot of great moments of his and truthfully football today is grieving because a great died today, not just a player, but a person. He was a terrific person."

"Whilst I didn't see him play, my father and grandfather spoke about Alfredo and his play a lot," Javier Mascherano said. "He was a gift to world football, and without doubt we will miss him a lot. He did so much for this sport, and all that he left means he is a true legend." Gonzalo Higuain echoed his team-mate's sentiments in hailing one of the greatest players of all time. "He helped me a lot when I was younger and arrived in Madrid," the Napoli striker said. "He was always close and treated me brilliantly. I can't say any more about my thanks and how much his passing hurts. He deserves all the demonstrations of warmth that the world of football is paying him."	sports
Maradona: I learned a lot from 'maestro' Di Stefano - Goal.com	The Argentina great has joined the chorus of praise for his late compatriot, revealing the deep impression that the legendary footballer made on his own career Diego Maradona has paid tribute to Alfredo Di Stefano, hailing the Real Madrid icon's impact upon his own career. The 88-year-old Argentinian, who passed away on Monday following cardiac arrest, enjoyed a glittering career in football, winning eight La Liga titles and five European Cups in 11 seasons with los Blancos.

Miranda quashes Atletico Madrid exit talk - Goal.com	The defender has dismissed rumours linking him with Barcelona and the Premier League, while team-mate Filipe Luis has refused to rule out a possible exit Miranda has insisted he has no desire to leave Atletico Madrid this summer, despite rumours about a possible transfer. The Brazilian centre-half has been linked with Manchester United and Barcelona in the current transfer window, with both clubs known to be keen to bolster their defensive options. However, it appears that the 29-year-old, who made 32 league appearances as Atletico clinched their first Liga crown since 1996 last season, will remain at Vicente Calderon. "Don't worry, I'm staying," he was quoted as saying by Marca, despite previously claiming to have received offers from Premier League and La Liga sides. However, while Miranda appears to be content to remain with Atletico, Filipe Luis, who has been linked with a move to Chelsea as long-term replacement for new Roma signing Ashley Cole, was less certain on his own future. "We'll see what happens," the 28-year-old said when asked if he was likely to leave. Atletico enjoyed a hugely successful campaign last term, ending the season as La Liga champions as well as beaten Champions League finalists following a 4-1 defeat to Real Madrid in Lisbon.	sports

Miroslav Klose breaks Ronaldo World Cup goal record - Goal.com	The 36-year-old has written a new piece of football history after surpassing the Brazil legend's tally of 15 World Cup goals Miroslav Klose has become the top goalscorer in World Cup history after scoring in Germany's semi-final against Brazil on Tuesday. The 36-year-old struck in the first half against the host nation, tapping home from point-blank range after Julio Cesar had denied him at the first attempt.    Name       Goals       Miroslav Klose 16 Ronaldo 15  Gerd Muller 14  Just Fontaine 13 Pele 12  Sandor Kocsis 11  Jurgen Klinsmann 11  Helmut Rahn 10  Gary Lineker 10  Gabriel Batistuta 10  Since his last World Cup in 2006, Ronaldo's record tally of 15 goals in the competition had remained untouched, but Klose has now surpassed that tally at last in his fourth tournament. The Lazio striker netted five goals at the 2002 World Cup, five times four years later, four in 2010 and now twice during this summer's showpiece. Ronaldo amassed his strikes across three tournaments, in 1998, 2002 and 2006 - and lifted the famous trophy once along the way, 12 years ago this summer. Klose, 36, started the tournament level on goals with compatriot, Gerd Muller, who starred in the 1970 and 1974 tournaments and boasts an incredible ratio of 1.08 goals per World Cup games. Klose, who was born in Poland, made his Germany debut as a substitute on March 24, 2011 and marked the occasion with a goal. He struck again against Greece just four days later - despite being afforded just 33 minutes over the course of his first two international outings - and the goals just never stopped coming, particularly in major tournaments.	sports
Brazil 1 - 7 Germany Match report - Goal.com	The veteran striker broke Ronaldo's record for finals goals as Thomas Muller, Sami Khedira, Toni Kroos and Andre Schurrle combined to decimate Luiz Felipe Scolari's side Germany have reached the World Cup final after they annihiliated hosts  Brazil 7-1 in their semi-final clash in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday. Shorn of injured playmaker Neymar, who suffered a fractured vertebra in the quarter-final against Colombia, and suspended captain Thiago Silva, Brazil were torn apart by a ruthless Germany at Estadio Mineirao. Miroslav Klose became the leading scorer in World Cup finals history as Joachim Low's side scored four goals in the space of six first-half minutes and led 5-0 after only 29 minutes, then struck twice in the second half to set up a final against either Netherlands or Argentina at the Maracana on Sunday. Thomas Muller set the ball rolling with his fifth of the tournament and veteran striker Klose netted his 16th World Cup goal, surpassing legendary Brazil striker Ronaldo's tally as the shell-shocked Selecao were totally outclassed. Brazil had no answer to Germany's passing and movement as Toni Kroos struck twice and Sami Khedira added a fifth before substitute Andre Schurrle scored twice in the second half as the hosts were totally humiliated in the most emphatic semi-final win in World Cup history. Oscar pulled back a late goal on the break, but it was no consolation on a miserable night for Brazil. Germany were a class apart and Brazil fans sportingly applauded as they became the first team to score seven goals in a World Cup semi-final and will take some beating as they attempt to win the trophy for the first time since 1990, while the inquest will now start for the home nation. The hosts started brightly against Colombia in the quarter-finals, but looked nervous early on and Germany took full advantage when Muller put them in front just 11 minutes in courtesy of some dreadful defending. It was all too straightforward for the Bayern Munich forward, who side-footed home after being left unmarked from an outswinging Kroos corner. Brazil looked disjointed as they gave the ball away far too easily, while Germany were playing with a swagger and doubled their lead with a landmark Klose goal after 23 minutes. Muller was involved once again, as he cut in from the right and laid the ball off for Klose after being picked out by an incisive Kroos pass. The veteran striker slotted into the corner with his right foot after Julio Cesar had kept out his initial attempt. Luiz Felipe Scolari's men were stunned, but far worse was to come as Germany capitalised on more shambolic defending to score another three goals in the space of five minutes. First, Kroos was on hand to fire home with his left foot from 18 yards after Muller had failed to make contact with a Philipp Lahm pass, then the midfielder struck again almost straight from the kick-off as Brazil fell apart. The Bayern Munich man robbed Fernandinho as he dithered in possession and laid the ball off for Khedira, who unselfishly cut it back for his fellow midfielder to net. And the outstanding Khedira got in on the act by adding a fifth with only 29 minutes gone, driving forward and passing to Mesut Ozil and then finishing with his right foot after the Arsenal midfielder cut the ball back to him inside the penalty area.   Scolari replaced Fernandinho and Hulk with Paulinho and Ramires at half-time and both substitutes were in the thick of the action early in the second half as they brought saves out of Manuel Neuer. But normal service was resumed as Germany showed no mercy and Cesar produced a fine save to tip over Muller's goal-bound striker on the hour mark. Cesar could do nothing to deny substitute Schurrle a sixth goal 69 minutes in, though, and once again it was all too easy as Lahm fed Khedira, who in turn picked out the Chelsea forward and he made no mistake with a simple finish. And Schurrle put Germany in seventh heaven with a clinical left-foot finish at the near post 11 minutes from time that prompted Brazil fans to sportingly applaud despite their heartbreak. Oscar pulled a goal back when he cut inside Jerome Boateng and finished a minute from time, but the damage had long since been done.	sports

David Luiz: I am so sorry – I only wanted to make Brazilians happy - Goal.com	The hosts were humiliated as they slumped to a shocking 7-1 defeat to Germany in the World Cup semi-final in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday David Luiz has apologised "to all Brazilians" for the humiliating 7-1 defeat to Germany in the World Cup semi-final in Belo Horizonte. Brazil's dreams of winning the tournament as hosts were smashed as they slumped to an embarrassing defeat. Germany blew Luiz Felipe Scolari's men away as they took a 5-0 lead in the first half before sealing the emphatic 7-1 scoreline after the break. David Luiz, who was named captain in the absence of the suspended Thiago Silva, could only offer an apology at full-time for an abject personal and collective performance. "I just wanted to give some happiness to my people. To my people, who suffer so much already," Luiz told Rede Globo. "Unfortunately we couldn't do it. I'm sorry, everyone. Sorry to all Brazilians. I wanted to see my people smiling. "Everyone knows how important it was for me to make the Brazilian people happy, even if just because of football." Goalkeeper Julio Cesar echoed Luiz's apology and felt the Brazil players became "lost" during a dramatic opening 45 minutes. "I think we got a little lost there and Germany noticed we were like that and managed to score the goals," said Cesar. "I'd rather we had lost 1-0 because of my mistake. “To explain what happened now is complicated. This is a dream that ends, although not the way we hoped. "In my life, I've learned to be a man at all times. I won't shy away from anything, I'll take it on the chin. One day I'll give happiness to those people."	sports

Aurier plays down Arsenal links but admits Premier League move would be a 'dream' - Goal.com	The Cote d'Ivoire international says reports that he has signed for the Gunners are "not true" but remains interested in a move to England or Paris Saint-Germain Serge Aurier insists he has not agreed to sign for Arsenal but admits he would love to move to England. The Cote d'Ivoire international, who impressed in the World Cup despite his country's group stage elimination, was identified by Arsene Wenger as a potential replacement for Bacary Sagna and last month talks with Toulouse over a €9 million deal reached an advanced stage.

"I've been told that I had already signed with Arsenal. That is not true," he told Foot Mercato. "All I can say is that the Premier League is the league I enjoy the most. Things are clear. I've always given my preference to England. But I've not given any sort of agreement to anyone. So I'm free to discuss with any club."

"To play in England is a dream, but sometimes, dreams do not come true," he added. "So if PSG or Monaco are interested, I can't neglect them. They should see my people and we'll see from there. If ever a transfer occurs, I want a club that can guarantee me playing time. "I've heard of the interest of PSG. It's a great club, one the best in Europe today.

I'll leave Van Persie decision as late as possible - Van Gaal - Goal.com	The Dutch coach has insisted he will make no snap judgements on the forward's availability after the striker sat out training on Tuesday Louis van Gaal insists he will wait on the fitness of Robin van Persie for as long as possible after the Netherlands striker trained alone on the eve of the World Cup semi-final against Argentina. The Manchester United star and full-back Daryl Janmaat both reported stomach upsets on Tuesday, with Van Gaal leaving both to train separately as a precautionary measure. And the Dutch coach says he will make a final decision on striker Van Persie in particular on Wednesday, just hours before the game at the Arena Corinthians in Sao Paulo. “Van Persie had some intestinal problems so it was best he didn’t train today,” Van Gall told a press conference. “I don’t know if he will be 100 per cent. I will have to take these decisions tomorrow. We have more than a day to go and Van Persie is a very important player to us. “He is our captain, so in that capacity alone he is very important, and in principle my captains always play.” The fitness of Van Persie and Janmaat are not the only reasons for concern for Van Gaal, with defender Ron Vlaar short of fitness and midfielder Nigel de Jong looking to make a shock early return from a thigh injury which had looked set to end his World Cup. “De Jong tried out today and we will have to wait and see how it looks tomorrow,” Van Gaal admitted. “If you want to return to the pitch so quickly there has to be a reaction. We will see how he reacts. Vlaar is the same. We’ll wait and see.” Much has been said about Lionel Messi in the build-up to the crunch clash, with the Barcelona star expected to be the main man for Alejandro Sabella’s Argentina side. But Van Gaal insists that while he will prepare his side to step Messi, the Albiceleste have many more players with which they could cause his side damage. “Messi was once elected the best football player in the world, and that’s not for nothing,” he added. “At the highest stage he can always pull it off. “In principle, he has always found it rather difficult to repeat that at national level and he wants to show he can do that. We need to stop him doing it. “But we are playing against Argentina, we always refer to teams not to individuals. We showed the players some things on Argentina this morning, but I need to see how they will play and with which players before deciding exactly how we will play.” The semi-final kicks off at 22:00CET on Wednesday, with the winners going on to play Brazil or Germany in Sunday’s final at the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro.	sports
World Cup is a homosexual abomination - Russian priest - Goal.com	Alexander Shumsky, a Christianity figure, has controversially slammed the haircuts and multi-coloured boots adorned by players in Brazil this summer The World Cup is "a homosexual abomination", according to one angry Russian priest, who says male footballers may as well wear women's underwear and bras. Orthodox Christianity religious figure Alexander Shumsky came out with the controversial stance against the biggest single event sporting competition as it reaches the semi-final stage. Although most people might see the different types and colours of boots adorned by footballers as a good variety, Shumsky slammed the choice of footwear and claims that liberals are trying to drown traditional Christianity with football. "Wearing pink and blue shoes is like wearing women's underwear or wearing a bra," he ranted on Christian website Russian People's Line. "The liberal ideology of globalisation is opposed to Christian values with football. I'm sure of it." The pink and blue boots which Shumsky is referring to are PUMA Tricks, which were released shortly before the tournament and were worn in South American this summer by the likes of Italy's Mario Balotelli, Spain's Cesc Fabregas and Brazil's Dante. Russia, coached by Fabio Capello, were unable to scrape out of Group H and were sent packing early in the tournament but Shumsky is delighted that his compatriots made a swift exit. "I am glad that Russia were eliminated and, by God's grace, no longer participate in this homosexual abomination that is the World Cup." The Russian priest even took offence at footballers' haircuts, branding them "unthinkable" during his controversial rant. Fifa will be hoping that Shumsky represents a tiny minority of Russians as the nation will be hosting the World Cup in four years' time.	sports
Prandelli: Balotelli not yet a champion - Goal.com	The former Italy coach has also taken a swipe at Giuseppe Rossi "as a man" and revealed that he and his family have been subjected to death threats Former Italy coach Cesare Prandelli believes that Mario Balotelli still has some way to go before he can be considered a true "champion". The AC Milan foward netted the winner in the Azzurri's World Cup opener against England but disappointed in their subsequent defeats to Costa Rica and Uruguay. Even Prandelli appeared to lose patience with Balotelli in Brazil, hauling the forward off at half-time in the latter loss, and he has now admitted that he feels the 23-year-old still has so much to prove. "For now he only has great shots, but he's not yet a champion," the new Galatasaray boss told reporters at his official unveiling on Tuesday. "He must work to become one." Prandelli also took a swipe at Giuseppe Rossi, who lashed out publicly at the coach following his omission from Italy's World Cup squad. "Giuseppe Rossi is the one who disappointed me the most, as a man more than as a player,” the former Fiorentina boss stated. Meanwhile, Prandelli revealed that he and his family have been subjected to death threats in the wake of the Azzurri's shock first-round elimination in Brazil and admitted that he has been taken aback by the severity of some of the criticism he received from the media just two years after leading Italy to the final of Euro 2012. "We are receiving numerous letters from so-called supporters,” Prandelli lamented. “I decided to resign and not to ask for any bonus from the Italian FA, and I promised myself not to train any Italian team, at least for the moment. "During the World Cup there were maybe some players who were frightened by the pressure, but the group was solid, not devastated as someone reported. “Being compared to Schettino [the infamous Costa Concordia captain, who left the ship while sinking] was the thing that hurt me the most."	sports

And the Dutch coach says he will make a final decision on striker Van Persie in particular on Wednesday, just hours before the game at the Arena Corinthians in Sao Paulo. “Van Persie had some intestinal problems so it was best he didn’t train today,” Van Gall told a press conference. “I don’t know if he will be 100 per cent. I will have to take these decisions tomorrow. We have more than a day to go and Van Persie is a very important player to us. “He is our captain, so in that capacity alone he is very important, and in principle my captains always play.” The fitness of Van Persie and Janmaat are not the only reasons for concern for Van Gaal, with defender Ron Vlaar short of fitness and midfielder Nigel de Jong looking to make a shock early return from a thigh injury which had looked set to end his World Cup. “De Jong tried out today and we will have to wait and see how it looks tomorrow,” Van Gaal admitted. “If you want to return to the pitch so quickly there has to be a reaction. We will see how he reacts. Vlaar is the same. We’ll wait and see.” Much has been said about Lionel Messi in the build-up to the crunch clash, with the Barcelona star expected to be the main man for Alejandro Sabella’s Argentina side. But Van Gaal insists that while he will prepare his side to step Messi, the Albiceleste have many more players with which they could cause his side damage. “Messi was once elected the best football player in the world, and that’s not for nothing,” he added. “At the highest stage he can always pull it off. “In principle, he has always found it rather difficult to repeat that at national level and he wants to show he can do that. We need to stop him doing it. “But we are playing against Argentina, we always refer to teams not to individuals. We showed the players some things on Argentina this morning, but I need to see how they will play and with which players before deciding exactly how we will play.” The semi-final kicks off at 22:00CET on Wednesday, with the winners going on to play Brazil or Germany in Sunday’s final at the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro.	sports

Prandelli: Balotelli not yet a champion - Goal.com	The former Italy coach has also taken a swipe at Giuseppe Rossi "as a man" and revealed that he and his family have been subjected to death threats Former Italy coach Cesare Prandelli believes that Mario Balotelli still has some way to go before he can be considered a true "champion". The AC Milan foward netted the winner in the Azzurri's World Cup opener against England but disappointed in their subsequent defeats to Costa Rica and Uruguay. Even Prandelli appeared to lose patience with Balotelli in Brazil, hauling the forward off at half-time in the latter loss, and he has now admitted that he feels the 23-year-old still has so much to prove. "For now he only has great shots, but he's not yet a champion," the new Galatasaray boss told reporters at his official unveiling on Tuesday. "He must work to become one." Prandelli also took a swipe at Giuseppe Rossi, who lashed out publicly at the coach following his omission from Italy's World Cup squad. "Giuseppe Rossi is the one who disappointed me the most, as a man more than as a player,” the former Fiorentina boss stated. Meanwhile, Prandelli revealed that he and his family have been subjected to death threats in the wake of the Azzurri's shock first-round elimination in Brazil and admitted that he has been taken aback by the severity of some of the criticism he received from the media just two years after leading Italy to the final of Euro 2012. "We are receiving numerous letters from so-called supporters,” Prandelli lamented. “I decided to resign and not to ask for any bonus from the Italian FA, and I promised myself not to train any Italian team, at least for the moment. "During the World Cup there were maybe some players who were frightened by the pressure, but the group was solid, not devastated as someone reported. “Being compared to Schettino [the infamous Costa Concordia captain, who left the ship while sinking] was the thing that hurt me the most."	sports
Scholes: I can't wait for Van Gaal to take over at Manchester United - Goal.com	The former midfielder believes the 62-year-old has "a bit of genius about him" and insists the Dutchman will significantly improve his new club's displays after a "shocking season" Paul Scholes believes Louis van Gaal's "Midas touch" will help Manchester United's recovery from a dreadful 2013-14 Premier League campaign. The 62-year-old was named as David Moyes' successor in May and will take charge at Old Trafford following Netherlands' participation in this summer's World Cup in Brazil. The Dutch face Argentina on Wednesday evening for a spot in the final and the former midfielder insists Van Gaal will need to be at his best after United's "shocking season". “Right now, Manchester United fans (and myself) cannot wait for Louis van Gaal to get the job started at Old Trafford,” Scholes wrote in an exclusive blog for Paddy Power. “It’s not a vintage Holland team he’s managing and Van Gaal has got them to the brink of a World Cup Final. He’s going to have to perform a similar operation at United after a shocking season in 2013-2014. “Van Gaal seems to have the Midas touch, and with his coaching reputation and vast experience he can bring a lot to the club. He’ll improve last year’s performance by 20 to 25 per cent, I feel. “As well as the new signings, Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera, (and hopefully more to come) he’ll bring more out of the players who are already there. I’m actually really excited about next season.” Scholes also believes that Van Gaal's key substitutions at crucial times during Netherlands' World Cup run shows that he has "a bit of genius about him". “Van Gaal is not afraid of big decisions, which he showed by bringing on the Newcastle keeper Tim Krul for the Dutch No1 Jasper Cillessen for the penalty shootout against Costa Rica,” he added. “Krul had only saved two out of last 20 penalties with Newcastle. The evidence did not seem to be there for that big a decision. But whatever Louis van Gaal does, seems to work. "He substituted his captain, Robin van Persie, when Holland were 1-0 down to Mexico, and they came back to win. He seems to hav, and hopefully can work this magic on United next year.”	sports
World Cup is a homosexual abomination - Russian priest - Goal.com	Alexander Shumsky, a Christianity figure, has controversially slammed the haircuts and multi-coloured boots adorned by players in Brazil this summer The World Cup is "a homosexual abomination", according to one angry Russian priest, who says male footballers may as well wear women's underwear and bras. Orthodox Christianity religious figure Alexander Shumsky came out with the controversial stance against the biggest single event sporting competition as it reaches the semi-final stage. Although most people might see the different types and colours of boots adorned by footballers as a good variety, Shumsky slammed the choice of footwear and claims that liberals are trying to drown traditional Christianity with football. "Wearing pink and blue shoes is like wearing women's underwear or wearing a bra," he ranted on Christian website Russian People's Line. "The liberal ideology of globalisation is opposed to Christian values with football. I'm sure of it." The pink and blue boots which Shumsky is referring to are PUMA Tricks, which were released shortly before the tournament and were worn in South American this summer by the likes of Italy's Mario Balotelli, Spain's Cesc Fabregas and Brazil's Dante. Russia, coached by Fabio Capello, were unable to scrape out of Group H and were sent packing early in the tournament but Shumsky is delighted that his compatriots made a swift exit. "I am glad that Russia were eliminated and, by God's grace, no longer participate in this homosexual abomination that is the World Cup." The Russian priest even took offence at footballers' haircuts, branding them "unthinkable" during his controversial rant. Fifa will be hoping that Shumsky represents a tiny minority of Russians as the nation will be hosting the World Cup in four years' time.	sports

Francis Fernandes released by Salgaocar FC - Goal.com	The attacking midfielder parts ways with the Goan club after eight seasons with the Greens...

Suarez being sued in Italy for biting Chiellini - Goal.com	The Uruguay international is facing a court case in Italy after a national union filed a lawsuit for his “assault” on the Juventus defender The Codacons, a collection of unions established in Italy to protect the rights of consumers, is attempting to sue Luis Suarez for his “assault” on Giorgio Chiellini. The Liverpool forward was suspended for nine competitive international fixtures and banned from all football-related activity for four months after being found guilty of biting the defender during Uruguay's 1-0 win over the Azzurri in the group stages of World Cup 2014. Italian legislation allows trials into incidents that occurred outside the country if the victim is an Italian citizen and courts in Rome have confirmed that the case has been brought to their attention. “Now we are waiting to see what the courts decide,” Codacons President Carlo Rienzi told Sport Mediaset. “If they recognise, as we suggested, a potential crime in Suarez’s behaviour, then they can analyse the video and photographic evidence.” The case was put forward solely by the Codacons and neither Chiellini nor the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) have played a part in the legal action. The union has tried to file football-related law suits in the past, including one which called on Serie A to be halted following refereeing errors. It was claimed by the union that the mistakes resulted in people who had paid to watch the match or have a bet on the game being defrauded.	sports

Ferguson hails Di Stefano: 'One of the greatest of all time' - Goal.com	The Real Madrid icon died on Monday aged 88 and the Scot has paid tribute to the former striker, whom he saw play in the 1960 European Cup final at Hampden Park Former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson has paid tribute to Real Madrid legend Alfredo di Stefano, who died on Monday. Di Stefano, 88, had been under supervision at Madrid's Gregorio Maranon Hospital after suffering a heart attack on Saturday, but the two-time Ballon d'Or winner sadly passed away two days later. Tributes have been flowing in for the Argentine-born forward, who scored 308 goals in 396 appearances for Madrid, and now Ferguson has paid his respects to a legendary figure. "The great question which always comes up is 'who are the greatest players?'" the Scot told Sky Sports News. "There is a phalanx of great ones – [Johan] Cruyff, [Diego] Maradona, Pele, [Ferenc] Puskas and Di Stefano. Di Stefano was one of the greatest in my mind. "He had fantastic balance and poise – if you look at one of the goals he scored against Eintracht Frankfurt it was completely what we were talking about – the balance he had. Unbelievable, he was." Di Stefano - winner of five consecutive European cups with Real between 1956 and 1960 - went on to coach the iconic club in two separate spells. In his first stint, Di Stefano came up against Ferguson's Aberdeen in the 1983 European Cup Winners' Cup final, which was won by the Scottish club 2-1 after extra time in Sweden - a meeting the former United boss remembers clearly. "It was an honour to come up against Di Stefano," he said. "What I did, out of respect for him, was I bought a bottle of Scottish Malt whisky and gave it to him the night before the match when the two teams had an opportunity to train on the pitch at the venue for the final. "We were second, they were first. When he came off, they were coming down the tunnel and I said 'Mr Di Stefano, I'd like to give you this gift.' He was taken aback; he was really taken aback. Ferguson added: "He said, 'Aberdeen are a team that money can't buy. They have a soul, and a family spirit'. Those words – you couldn't say any more, in terms of praise for a football team. It was very generous of him. "He was always the focus of Real Madrid wherever they went. He had a fantastic life and I'm proud to have been associated with him in a small way."	sports

The Briton, a director from Match Hospitality and the former agent of Sir Bobby Charlton, had been staying at the same Rio de Janeiro hotel as Fifa president Sepp Blatter and several other officials from football’s governing body when he was taken into custody.

Goal Academy Watch: Football School Of India - Goal.com	Goal takes you through a tour of the upcoming Football School of India, situated in three cities of Maharashtra, that is sure to become a breeding ground for India's future stars Continuing its special series on the elite football academies in India, Goal today has a look at one of the neo-age establishments that is fast ensuring it becomes a future supply-line for India's next generation of stars - Football School of India Abhishek Yadav is the founder and coach-in-chief at the academy and has turned out for various clubs including Mumbai FC, Mahindra United and Churchill Brothers, winning all there is to won in India. He also has 33 international caps to his name for the Blue Tigers. Here, in an exclusive interview with Goal, he lays down the goals, aspirations and methods he plans to implement to achieve success with the academy. Football School of India (FSI) was born out of the intense desire of Yadav to ensure the children who are destined to become future footballers in country were equipped with the right amount of technical training at an early age so as to seamlessly develop themselves. “We’re not saying we can make all the players represent the country, but if we at least make three wear the national colours, it's mission accomplished for us," said Yadav. He believes that the advice available for the youngsters today wasn't something the previous generation of players availed of. He also aims to integrate football in the existing education for the holistic development of the youngsters. As stated above, the academy was Yadav's initiation, with help from former Indian internationals Shanmugham Venkatesh and Deepak Mandal. Yadav thanks his friends and co-founders who travel specially to Mumbai to impart not just information to the kids, but also to motivate the kids. FSI, which orignally began operation in Mumbai, has two other centres in Pune and Nashik. Motivation is a founding block for propagation of excellence in Abhishek's words and this is wired throughout the academy's functionings.   Abhhishek Yadav is the co-founder of the academy Having just initiated the academy over one-and-a-half years ago, Yadav is the head coach. He is assisted in his work by TEN other coaches spread throughout the centres of FSI. Of these coaches, one holds a 'B' license badge, whilst the others are actively pursuing their coaching certificates. Yadav states that the expenses of the coaches are all taken care of by the FSI management, so as to help them attain the required experience, with no burden on them. "I understand the troubles with the financial aspect of the license and don't want to burden them at all," says Yadav.  The academy is one of the few new saplings who actively employs a sports psychologist as well as a dedicated physiotherapist. Yadav elucidates that the focus is also on the self-help aspect for kids. The most important information here is that the academy actively tries to involve the parents in the training and feedback programs to ensure the child develops in an overall fashion. Unlike many government funded institutes or private ones, FSI carries out active scouting missions in centres where football activities are a major draw. Having coaches spread throughout the country and armed with a keen eye for spotting talent, the founder explains, "Quality in quantity is my mantra. Our coaches are trained in spotting talent in a crowd and we make sure we attempt to entice the kids we shortlist from tournaments held in not just metros, but other towns as well." The academy hopes to be a hotbed for Indian internationals in the future With no specific period of the year for recruitment shortlisted, the focus is on talent recruitment immediately. "If I find somebody better than anyone I've trained, I make the effort to entice him immediately," he explained. For an academy which operates within the age groups of Under-6 to Under-17, the institute is considerably well-equipped, especially keeping in mind its relative infancy. The academy has a field in Panvel, which has an astro-turf. A gymnasium has been added too, though Yadav expounds that he doesn't encourage much participation from young kids in weight-lifting, though body exercises are the order of the day. Their head coach though, thinks the ground serves the purpose of the academy, whilst highlighting the importance of the medicinal ball. He mentioned that they do a lot of training with the ball instead of mere physical drills so as to improve their touch on the ball. “We do a lot of our work on-the-ball training. But I ensure the kids train and enlightened on the advantages of using a medicinal ball everyday.” Unfortunately, being a new initiative, Yadav has barely had time to advertise his academy to sponsors. He explains that prepping up the academy itself has been so demanding, that he has barely had time to look elsewhere.  He hopes to change this in the future though, to avoid fates of other renowned academies that have faded away due to lack of investments. The kids in the three age categories are subject to one session daily, which, as stated by Yadav, takes place from 4.30 to 6.30 in the evening, to facilitate school timings for kids. On weekends, morning sessions are prime focus. All sessions are pre-planned, with a lot of focus on "on-the-ball excellence." "Learning Football is so much fun at Football School of India. We get to train with India international players. Just by playing with them we learn so much. I want to play for India some day,” says Nakul Shelke, a young colt training with the academy.  Rating – 7/10 As Yadav hypothesizes, India is a hotbed for talent. He believes it is his prerogative to help them blossom, especially in the world of Indian football. One hopes they achieve their goals so as to ensure a better, brighter future for Indian football.

Silvestre: Shaw’s signing is a good investment by Manchester United - Goal.com	The former Manchester United defender believes that Louis Van Gaal is the right man to take the club forward... EXCLUSIVE By Shikharr Chandra Mikael Silvestre backed Manchester United for having spent £30 million to snap up Luke Shaw from Southampton on a four-year deal. Shaw will earn around £160,000 a week at Old Trafford, making him the highest-paid teenager in world football. Silvestre opined that the deal wasn’t ‘expensive’ for United given that they have tied the player down for at least four years. “You have to look at the entire deal here. Okay the sum is £30 million but how long has he signed for? Four years. So you have to keep that in mind as well." “I know it’s expensive if you look at it this way but when you join Manchester United you don’t stay there for just one year, you will probably be there for four or five years. I stayed there for nine years. So overall, after six or seven years, you won’t say that it was an expensive deal. It is a good investment by the club,” he told Goal at an event celebrating Chevrolet’s debut on Manchester United’s home shirt which also saw General Motors India launch the Chevrolet Beat and SAIL Hatchback Manchester United Limited Editions. Manchester United had a tumultuous 2013-14 season where they finished seventh, missing out on a place in the Champions League. David Moyes, who was appointed successor to Sir Alex Ferguson was shown the door less than nine months into the job with Ryan Giggs taking over the reins for the final five matches. Silvestre feels that it’s unfair to lay all the blame on Moyes and everyone needs to ponder over what went wrong. “I wasn’t in the dressing room and so I can’t really comment on what happened inside. But the performances were below par. They were not consistent enough and when you challenge for the Premier League, Champions League and the FA Cup, you need consistency." “Sadly that was not the case. I can’t exactly say who was to be blamed. Everyone has responsibilities and I don’t think the players are blaming Moyes or Moyes is blaming the players. Everyone has to look at themselves and ask whether ‘I could have done better’ because from the outside it was a bit difficult to judge,” he reasoned. Louis Van Gaal has been appointed as the Manchester United manager and the Dutchman is expected to take over following Netherlands’s sojourn at the World Cup. The 36 year-old believes that Van Gaal will lead Manchester United to winning ways once again. “As soon as he was announced as the new manager, I was convinced that he will be a good one for United. He has a great record for both club and country and he is just showing that in the World Cup with Netherlands. He has got what it takes to be a manager for a club like United and he is coming at the right time.” Next season, Manchester United will be without two of their most experienced centre-backs in Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand with the former having joined Inter Milan while the latter is expected to pen a deal with Queens Park Rangers soon. The French defender hopes that the 20-time league champions are active in the transfer market so as to cover for the said positions. “I think there have already been two signings (Ander Herrera and Shaw) and we can expect more by the end of August, so we will see then. They lost two centre-backs this time and so we can expect the manager to sign a couple of experienced players in that area.”	sports
Prandelli: Galatasaray will win with style - Goal.com	The former Italy boss is determined to lead the club into a new era of success after being named as Roberto Mancini's successor at the Turk Telekom Arena Galatasaray unveiled Cesare Prandelli as their new coach on Tuesday, with the Italian immediately setting his sights on creating a team that is both successful and stylish. The 56-year-old only stepped down as Italy boss just under two weeks ago, but has already embarked upon a new coaching adventure after being confirmed as compatriot Roberto Mancini's successor at the Turk Telekom Arena.  Last season, the Istanbul club finished second in the Super Lig and reached the last-16 of the Champions League, so Prandelli, who put pen to paper on a two-year contract, is determined to deliver silverware with an attractive brand of football. "Our mission is to create a winning team, able to win trophies and play an entertaining style of football," the former Fiorentina boss declared. "I’ve visited the technical centre, I think we have everything to work and perform well. "To achieve success, every supporter, every player, every part of the club has to think the same way. There are many good players already, we all have to work hard together." Encouragingly, Prandelli already appears to have struck up a good rapport with Unal Aysal, revealing that the Gala chairman played a key role in persuading him to make a swift return to the dug-out. "I immediately found great sympathy with chairman Unal Aysal. When we met the first time I was immediately convinced by a winning project," added Prandelli. "This club has a very rich and great history but, as Aysal said, we have to look at a great future ahead of us." Prandelli vacated his role as Italy boss after failing to lead the Azzurri out of the group stage of World Cup 2014. 	sports
Robben: More to Argentina than Messi - Goal.com	The 30-year-old has labelled the Barcelona man a “huge player” but rejected claims that the Albiceleste are overly reliant upon the four-time Ballon d'Or winner Netherlands ace Arjen Robben has dismissed the notion that Argentina are a one-man team, claiming that there is more to Alejandro Sabella's side than Lionel Messi. The Bayern Munich winger holds the Albiceleste attacker in the highest esteem but he does not feel that Oranje's World Cup semi-final opponents rely too heavily upon the four-time Ballon d'Or winner. "Argentina have a huge player in him, true, but that does not mean that everything revolves only around Lionel Messi," Robben told reporters ahead of Tuesday's last-four showdown in Sao Paulo. Meanwhile, Netherlands centre-back Stefan de Vrij insisted that he is not in the least bit perturbed by the prospect of dealing with Messi. "I'm not afraid of anyone," the defender told Algemeen Dagbald. "Not even Messi. "I am especially focused on him, but I’m not afraid of him. In fact, I am very happy to play against him.” Netherlands are bidding to reach their second successive World Cup final, having been beaten 1-0 by Spain in the tournament decider in South Africa four years ago.	sports

Suarez being sued in Italy for biting Chiellini - Goal.com	The Uruguay international is facing a court case in Italy after a national union filed a lawsuit for his “assault” on the Juventus defender The Codacons, a collection of unions established in Italy to protect the rights of consumers, is attempting to sue Luis Suarez for his “assault” on Giorgio Chiellini. The Liverpool forward was suspended for nine competitive international fixtures and banned from all football-related activity for four months after being found guilty of biting the defender during Uruguay's 1-0 win over the Azzurri in the group stages of World Cup 2014. Italian legislation allows trials into incidents that occurred outside the country if the victim is an Italian citizen and courts in Rome have confirmed that the case has been brought to their attention. “Now we are waiting to see what the courts decide,” Codacons President Carlo Rienzi told Sport Mediaset. “If they recognise, as we suggested, a potential crime in Suarez’s behaviour, then they can analyse the video and photographic evidence.” The case was put forward solely by the Codacons and neither Chiellini nor the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) have played a part in the legal action. The union has tried to file football-related law suits in the past, including one which called on Serie A to be halted following refereeing errors. It was claimed by the union that the mistakes resulted in people who had paid to watch the match or have a bet on the game being defrauded.	sports

'If I get Italy job, Balotelli must grow up' - Mancini - Goal.com	The coach has his eyes on taking over the national side and revealed he would build the team around the striker, Ciro Immobile and Marco Verratti Roberto Mancini says he "loves" Mario Balotelli but admitted he must "grow up" after revealing his desire to become Italy boss. Mancini left his post at Galatasaray at the end of the season, after guiding the club to a second-place finish in his sole campaign at the helm of the Super Lig outfit. Despite signing a two-year contract extension ahead of the World Cup, Italy's first-round exit prompted Cesare Prandelli to depart as national team boss, and he has since taken up the role vacated by Mancini in Istanbul. That move has paved the way for Mancini to take over as Italy head coach, and the former Manchester City and Inter boss would be humbled to be offered the job. "Italy would be an honour for me," he told Corriere dello Sport. "No one called me but I would be proud.[The] FIGC [Italian Football Association] need serious and competent men." He added: "The national team were too old? The age does not matter. "I love [Mario] Balotelli, but he must grow up. With [Marco] Verratti and [Ciro] Immobile, the team can be reconstructed." Mancini worked with Balotelli during spells as Inter and Manchester City boss, but on both occasions the pair became embroiled in heated disputes over the striker's disciplinary issues.	sports
Brazil 1 - 7 Germany Match report - Goal.com	The veteran striker broke Ronaldo's record for finals goals as Thomas Muller, Sami Khedira, Toni Kroos and Andre Schurrle combined to decimate Luiz Felipe Scolari's side Germany have reached the World Cup final after they annihiliated hosts  Brazil 7-1 in their semi-final clash in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday. Shorn of injured playmaker Neymar, who suffered a fractured vertebra in the quarter-final against Colombia, and suspended captain Thiago Silva, Brazil were torn apart by a ruthless Germany at Estadio Mineirao. Miroslav Klose became the leading scorer in World Cup finals history as Joachim Low's side scored four goals in the space of six first-half minutes and led 5-0 after only 29 minutes, then struck twice in the second half to set up a final against either Netherlands or Argentina at the Maracana on Sunday. Thomas Muller set the ball rolling with his fifth of the tournament and veteran striker Klose netted his 16th World Cup goal, surpassing legendary Brazil striker Ronaldo's tally as the shell-shocked Selecao were totally outclassed. Brazil had no answer to Germany's passing and movement as Toni Kroos struck twice and Sami Khedira added a fifth before substitute Andre Schurrle scored twice in the second half as the hosts were totally humiliated in the most emphatic semi-final win in World Cup history. Oscar pulled back a late goal on the break, but it was no consolation on a miserable night for Brazil. Germany were a class apart and Brazil fans sportingly applauded as they became the first team to score seven goals in a World Cup semi-final and will take some beating as they attempt to win the trophy for the first time since 1990, while the inquest will now start for the home nation. The hosts started brightly against Colombia in the quarter-finals, but looked nervous early on and Germany took full advantage when Muller put them in front just 11 minutes in courtesy of some dreadful defending. It was all too straightforward for the Bayern Munich forward, who side-footed home after being left unmarked from an outswinging Kroos corner. Brazil looked disjointed as they gave the ball away far too easily, while Germany were playing with a swagger and doubled their lead with a landmark Klose goal after 23 minutes. Muller was involved once again, as he cut in from the right and laid the ball off for Klose after being picked out by an incisive Kroos pass. The veteran striker slotted into the corner with his right foot after Julio Cesar had kept out his initial attempt. Luiz Felipe Scolari's men were stunned, but far worse was to come as Germany capitalised on more shambolic defending to score another three goals in the space of five minutes. First, Kroos was on hand to fire home with his left foot from 18 yards after Muller had failed to make contact with a Philipp Lahm pass, then the midfielder struck again almost straight from the kick-off as Brazil fell apart. The Bayern Munich man robbed Fernandinho as he dithered in possession and laid the ball off for Khedira, who unselfishly cut it back for his fellow midfielder to net. And the outstanding Khedira got in on the act by adding a fifth with only 29 minutes gone, driving forward and passing to Mesut Ozil and then finishing with his right foot after the Arsenal midfielder cut the ball back to him inside the penalty area.   Scolari replaced Fernandinho and Hulk with Paulinho and Ramires at half-time and both substitutes were in the thick of the action early in the second half as they brought saves out of Manuel Neuer. But normal service was resumed as Germany showed no mercy and Cesar produced a fine save to tip over Muller's goal-bound striker on the hour mark. Cesar could do nothing to deny substitute Schurrle a sixth goal 69 minutes in, though, and once again it was all too easy as Lahm fed Khedira, who in turn picked out the Chelsea forward and he made no mistake with a simple finish. And Schurrle put Germany in seventh heaven with a clinical left-foot finish at the near post 11 minutes from time that prompted Brazil fans to sportingly applaud despite their heartbreak. Oscar pulled a goal back when he cut inside Jerome Boateng and finished a minute from time, but the damage had long since been done.	sports
Liverpool star Jose Enrique thrilled at return to fitness - Goal.com	The Spainard's 2013-14 campaign was prematurely ended in November by a knee injury but he is back in pre-season training and desperate to get onto the pitch soon After a season plagued by injuries, Liverpool full-back Jose Enrique is desperate to hit the ground running in the 2014-15 campaign. The Spaniard made just eight Premier League appearances last term before a knee injury in November curtailed any further involvement. However, with the Reds' new season set to begin on August 16 at home to Southampton, Enrique is approaching full fitness and cannot wait to get started. "I've been here since last week and I'm really happy," he told the club's official website on his return to pre-season training. "I've been waiting for this moment for so long. I'm feeling great.

Silvestre: Shaw’s signing is a good investment by Manchester United - Goal.com	The former Manchester United defender believes that Louis Van Gaal is the right man to take the club forward... EXCLUSIVE By Shikharr Chandra Mikael Silvestre backed Manchester United for having spent £30 million to snap up Luke Shaw from Southampton on a four-year deal. Shaw will earn around £160,000 a week at Old Trafford, making him the highest-paid teenager in world football. Silvestre opined that the deal wasn’t ‘expensive’ for United given that they have tied the player down for at least four years. “You have to look at the entire deal here. Okay the sum is £30 million but how long has he signed for? Four years. So you have to keep that in mind as well." “I know it’s expensive if you look at it this way but when you join Manchester United you don’t stay there for just one year, you will probably be there for four or five years. I stayed there for nine years. So overall, after six or seven years, you won’t say that it was an expensive deal. It is a good investment by the club,” he told Goal at an event celebrating Chevrolet’s debut on Manchester United’s home shirt which also saw General Motors India launch the Chevrolet Beat and SAIL Hatchback Manchester United Limited Editions. Manchester United had a tumultuous 2013-14 season where they finished seventh, missing out on a place in the Champions League. David Moyes, who was appointed successor to Sir Alex Ferguson was shown the door less than nine months into the job with Ryan Giggs taking over the reins for the final five matches. Silvestre feels that it’s unfair to lay all the blame on Moyes and everyone needs to ponder over what went wrong. “I wasn’t in the dressing room and so I can’t really comment on what happened inside. But the performances were below par. They were not consistent enough and when you challenge for the Premier League, Champions League and the FA Cup, you need consistency." “Sadly that was not the case. I can’t exactly say who was to be blamed. Everyone has responsibilities and I don’t think the players are blaming Moyes or Moyes is blaming the players. Everyone has to look at themselves and ask whether ‘I could have done better’ because from the outside it was a bit difficult to judge,” he reasoned. Louis Van Gaal has been appointed as the Manchester United manager and the Dutchman is expected to take over following Netherlands’s sojourn at the World Cup. The 36 year-old believes that Van Gaal will lead Manchester United to winning ways once again. “As soon as he was announced as the new manager, I was convinced that he will be a good one for United. He has a great record for both club and country and he is just showing that in the World Cup with Netherlands. He has got what it takes to be a manager for a club like United and he is coming at the right time.” Next season, Manchester United will be without two of their most experienced centre-backs in Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand with the former having joined Inter Milan while the latter is expected to pen a deal with Queens Park Rangers soon. The French defender hopes that the 20-time league champions are active in the transfer market so as to cover for the said positions. “I think there have already been two signings (Ander Herrera and Shaw) and we can expect more by the end of August, so we will see then. They lost two centre-backs this time and so we can expect the manager to sign a couple of experienced players in that area.”	sports
Prandelli: Galatasaray will win with style - Goal.com	The former Italy boss is determined to lead the club into a new era of success after being named as Roberto Mancini's successor at the Turk Telekom Arena Galatasaray unveiled Cesare Prandelli as their new coach on Tuesday, with the Italian immediately setting his sights on creating a team that is both successful and stylish. The 56-year-old only stepped down as Italy boss just under two weeks ago, but has already embarked upon a new coaching adventure after being confirmed as compatriot Roberto Mancini's successor at the Turk Telekom Arena.  Last season, the Istanbul club finished second in the Super Lig and reached the last-16 of the Champions League, so Prandelli, who put pen to paper on a two-year contract, is determined to deliver silverware with an attractive brand of football. "Our mission is to create a winning team, able to win trophies and play an entertaining style of football," the former Fiorentina boss declared. "I’ve visited the technical centre, I think we have everything to work and perform well. "To achieve success, every supporter, every player, every part of the club has to think the same way. There are many good players already, we all have to work hard together." Encouragingly, Prandelli already appears to have struck up a good rapport with Unal Aysal, revealing that the Gala chairman played a key role in persuading him to make a swift return to the dug-out. "I immediately found great sympathy with chairman Unal Aysal. When we met the first time I was immediately convinced by a winning project," added Prandelli. "This club has a very rich and great history but, as Aysal said, we have to look at a great future ahead of us." Prandelli vacated his role as Italy boss after failing to lead the Azzurri out of the group stage of World Cup 2014. 	sports
'If I get Italy job, Balotelli must grow up' - Mancini - Goal.com	The coach has his eyes on taking over the national side and revealed he would build the team around the striker, Ciro Immobile and Marco Verratti Roberto Mancini says he "loves" Mario Balotelli but admitted he must "grow up" after revealing his desire to become Italy boss. Mancini left his post at Galatasaray at the end of the season, after guiding the club to a second-place finish in his sole campaign at the helm of the Super Lig outfit. Despite signing a two-year contract extension ahead of the World Cup, Italy's first-round exit prompted Cesare Prandelli to depart as national team boss, and he has since taken up the role vacated by Mancini in Istanbul. That move has paved the way for Mancini to take over as Italy head coach, and the former Manchester City and Inter boss would be humbled to be offered the job. "Italy would be an honour for me," he told Corriere dello Sport. "No one called me but I would be proud.[The] FIGC [Italian Football Association] need serious and competent men." He added: "The national team were too old? The age does not matter. "I love [Mario] Balotelli, but he must grow up. With [Marco] Verratti and [Ciro] Immobile, the team can be reconstructed." Mancini worked with Balotelli during spells as Inter and Manchester City boss, but on both occasions the pair became embroiled in heated disputes over the striker's disciplinary issues.	sports
Liverpool star Jose Enrique thrilled at return to fitness - Goal.com	The Spainard's 2013-14 campaign was prematurely ended in November by a knee injury but he is back in pre-season training and desperate to get onto the pitch soon After a season plagued by injuries, Liverpool full-back Jose Enrique is desperate to hit the ground running in the 2014-15 campaign. The Spaniard made just eight Premier League appearances last term before a knee injury in November curtailed any further involvement. However, with the Reds' new season set to begin on August 16 at home to Southampton, Enrique is approaching full fitness and cannot wait to get started. "I've been here since last week and I'm really happy," he told the club's official website on his return to pre-season training. "I've been waiting for this moment for so long. I'm feeling great. "I'm really happy to try to be playing games again. I've been working in the summer and I've been here for the last week. I've been working quite a lot in fitness terms.

Netherlands v Argentina Match preview - Goal.com	Dutch midfielder and Manchester City striker have both recovered from injury to feature for their respective nations, as they battle it out to face Germany or Brazil in the final Wednesday’s second semi-final brings together two of the world’s most enthralling footballing nations in a repeat of the final from the last South American World Cup in Argentina in 1978. Netherlands have confounded many people’s expectations by reaching the last four with a squad of which very little was expected. Whereas their reliance on a large number of Eredivisie-based players was thought to be a weakness, the impact of many of the lesser names has been a real strength in their run to the semi-finals. Coach Louis van Gaal has needed such a boost from the supporting cast too, with pre-tournament injuries to Kevin Strootman and Stijn Schaars followed by the loss of Nigel De Jong in the early moments of the last-16 clash against Mexico. Having stunned many by bringing on Tim Krul to make the winning penalty saves against Costa Rica in the last round, Van Gaal is set to hand first-choice keeper Jasper Cillessen the gloves once more against Argentina in what is likely to be an unchanged starting XI. Van Gaal's opposite number Alejandro Sabella has no such luxury, with Angel Di Maria missing due to a thigh strain which is likely to rule him out of the rest of the tournament. While Sergio Aguero returns after a leg muscle injury, Sabella must choose whether to give Ezequiel Lavezzi a start or bring in one of Fernando Gago or Maxi Rodriguez in Di Maria’s place. Marcos Rojo’s return from suspension should see him start ahead of Jose Maria Basanta, while Federico Fernandez could again miss out in favour of Martin Demichelis. NETHERLANDS: Cillessen; Vlaar, De Vrij, Martins Indi; Kuyt, Wijnaldum, Sneijder, Blind; Robben, Van Persie, Depay. ARGENTINA: Romero; Zabaleta, Demichelis, Garay, Rojo; M. Rodriguez, Gago, Biglia; Messi, Aguero, Higuain.	sports

Marcotti: A shocking exit for Scolari and Brazil - ESPN FC	BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil -- Eventually, you run out of ideas. At 1-0, the yellow-clad population of the Estadio Mineirao groaned. A bloody nose, yes. But stick some cotton in and suck it up. At 2-0, there was incredulity. A young lady in the stands raised her hand, thumb in, digits extended over her open mouth. 3-0 and 4-0 were one and the same. Two stabs from Toni Kroos in the space of 69 seconds, the fastest brace in the history of the World Cup. Like burning yourself on a hot stove and then stubbing your toe when you jump away in pain. Hurt and more hurt. No time in between to react. But afterward, it was defiance. Chants of "Bra-sil! Bra-sil!" Not lame but full-throated, perhaps as a way of venting anger at the players. At 5-0, folks began to make their way to the exits. Twenty-nine minutes had passed. Read it again. TWENTY-NINE. But people had seen enough. It wasn't a majority, obviously, not even a significant plurality, but enough that you would notice. They filed away silently, looking away from the pitch, a yellow goo oozing toward the stairwells. Halftime was predictable: boos and cat-calls rained down mercilessly and echoed in the cavernous Mineirao. If, prior to kickoff, the ground's acoustics had amplified the Brazilians' sound, now -- after five goals -- it was a roar. At 6-0, the wrath seemed focused on one man. Fred, the mustachioed centre-forward who for the past weeks had flailed in carrying the torch passed on by the legendary Selecao strikers of yesteryear, from Ronaldo and Romario all the way back to Pele and Artur Friedenreich. In truth, the insults, expletives and bile vomited in his direction had begun at the start of the second half, perhaps when the realization he was still on the pitch hit. They rose to a crescendo after Andre Schurrle made it six, and Fred laconically made way for Willian. At 7-0, it was simple. They rose as one and offered up an ovation. Schurrle's goal -- his second -- was pretty, but it wasn't Diego Maradona-against-England-in-1986 pretty. Were they applauding him? The Germans? Were they being sarcastic? Was it all of the above? Or was this merely the last possible reaction they could think of, having exhausted all others? By the time Oscar fixed the final score at 7-1, there had been scuffles in the stands (at least five distinct ones -- all among Brazil fans -- visible from the press tribune). There had also been a period of "oles" at every German touch. Fans do this when they're well ahead, either to celebrate their own side's supremacy or to mock their opponent's futility ("See? They finally strung two passes together."). This was different. It was perhaps as unprecedented as a nation with five stars above its crest losing 7-1 at home in a World Cup semifinal. There is no script for this. It's virgin territory for everyone involved. You don't know how to react. Luiz Felipe Scolari, looking as if he had sailed with Charles Marlowe into the heart of darkness (only, instead of finding Kurtz, he found Kroos), insisted afterward that life goes on. It does. It just won't be the same. "We tried to do what we could, and we did what we thought was best," he said. "But in six or seven minutes, they scored three or four goals [four in six minutes actually, but you wouldn't blame the shell-shocked Scolari for getting it wrong], and they did it in an extraordinary manner. It was one after the other. We tried [from the bench] to talk to them, to get them to stop for a second, but we just could not." In a situation such as this, you wonder if it's even worthwhile talking about tactics. Schemes and formations, after all, often mutate after one goal, usually after two and, well, when you're 5-0 down inside the time it takes to watch a rerun of Glee, there really is no such thing anymore. Scolari was devoid of his best player, Neymar, and his captain and defensive stalwart, Thiago Silva, but to his credit, he didn't use the absences as an excuse. "It would have made no difference," he said. "What was Neymar going to do?" Scolari tried to channel emotions and turn a negative into a neutral or maybe even a positive. David Luiz and Julio Cesar held up the missing talisman's No. 10 jersey, and even the mascots ("player escorts," as FIFA like to call them) sang their little lungs out during a raucous rendition of the Brazilian anthem. Scolari had gone for the jugular, with the same 4-2-3-1 formation he's played throughout the tournament, which many thought he'd abandon against the Germans. Little Bernard, all 5-foot-5 of him, the hometown hero, slotted into the wing, with Oscar shifting inside while Fernandinho and the returning Luiz Gustavo were ready to do battle. There were moments in the first few minutes when it looked like the old-style 4-2-4 Vicente Feola might have used in 1958. But that lasted until the first German goal in the 11th minute, when David Luiz somehow lost Thomas Muller in the penalty box and gifted him the easiest of side-foot finishes from a few yards out. Scolari's dream of winning a second World Cup as Brazil coach ended in humiliating fashion. "Everything was organized, everything was calm until the goal was scored," Scolari said. "Then everything became disorganized, everything was panicked." For his part, Joachim Low offered up the same formation that beat France -- with Phillip Lahm tucked in at right-back -- but with one crucial tweak. When he saw Scolari's lineup, he shifted Sami Khedira from his role alongside Bastian Schweinsteiger in front of the back four to one further forward next to Kroos. 4-2-3-1 became 4-1-4-1 or, if you like your lingo, from triangle up to triangle down. Kroos-Khedira became a two-man gang of outlaws plundering the Brazilian passing lanes and scything their way past the feeble yellow barriers. They prompted the next four goals, including the one that allowed Miroslav Klose to become the all-time leading scorer in World Cup history by passing Ronaldo's mark of 15. "They suddenly were not so well organized, they were hitting long balls, and we took advantage," Low said. "We hit them with fast counterattacks, and we knew that it would cause them problems." The game was over at halftime, except for the record books that would record Schurrle's brace and Oscar's strike. (Don't call it a "consolation goal." Don't you dare.) Afterward, David Luiz apologized in a tearful television interview. Oscar was a fountain of tears too, alternately cuddled by Thiago Silva, himself bawling, and Schurrle, his club teammate. Julio Cesar said that, in place of this, he would much rather have lost 1-0 while making the mistake that cost his team the game. That way, there would only be one scapegoat.

Instead, there are many. "I am responsible," Scolari said. "I pick the team, I prepare the team. Though if you ask my players, they will also say they're responsible because we are a team and we share victories and defeats. But for me, when I look at my life as a player, a coach, a teacher ... yes, it is the worst day of my life. I will be remembered as the man who lost 7-1 in Brazil in a World Cup semifinal." Low was as magnanimous as he could be, given the circumstances. After all, eight years ago, as Jurgen Klinsmann's assistant, he too saw his team come up short as host nation in a World Cup semifinal. "I know how Scolari feels," he said. "I remember 2006 and losing to Italy and the disappointment of a nation." He was being kind. As gut-wrenching as 2006 might have been to Germany, giving up a goal in the 119th minute of a match is not the same as giving up five within 30 minutes and losing 7-1, after 39 years of avoiding defeat in competitive matches on home soil. Low knows there isn't much you can take from this game, other than the result. His men found themselves in a freakish situation, they kept their heads, and they executed. If he's concerned about his troops being grounded and not getting carried away, he can take solace in the words of Kroos. "For a minute, we had trouble believing we were really 5-0 up," he said. "I mean, when do you ever win a semifinal 7-1?" "But we have one more game to go," he continued. "Nobody has ever become world champion in the semifinals." Those are the words of a young man who knows what he wants and knows how to get -- and they're just what Low wanted to hear. Germany and Brazil entered a Twilight Zone on Tuesday. One nation emerged to find itself 90 minutes from becoming champion of the world. The other has wounds that won't heal for a long time.

Brazil's 7-1 loss to Germany in the World Cup semifinals their worst in history - ESPN FC	When this World Cup began, Luiz Felipe Scolari's objective was to give the Brazilian supporters a performance that would make them forget forever what happened in 1950 in the Maracana. Well ... mission accomplished. The Maracanazo, the shocking 2-1 defeat to Uruguay that cost Brazil the World Cup they assumed they'd already won, is now only the second worst night in their history. That result was so stunningly awful that poets compared it to Hiroshima. Pele's father burst into tears in front of the television at full time. His young son, just 10 years old at the time, according to legend, comforted him and promised he would grow up and win the World Cup himself. Many of the players responsible for that failure were pariahs for decades afterward. What will become of these players? They are millionaires, most of them several times over. They will continue to earn fortunes, regardless of what happened in Belo Horizonte. Their ignominy will not diminish their bank balance. And yet the embarrassment will be so much more public. Sixty-four years ago, media coverage was limited. Now, the faces of these players are known across the world. Their shame is universal, and there is nowhere to hide. There was no hint of what was to come when the national anthems were played. Brazil sang loudly, in customary style, while David Luiz and Julio Cesar held up Neymar's No. 10 shirt. In retrospect, they might have been better hanging it on a stick and planting it in the German penalty area. It would have made as much of an impact as Fred did. Brazil players applaud their disappointed fans after an embarrassing 7-1 defeat at the hands of the German squad. Perhaps it would have been easier to take if this were simply a case of a wonderful team playing the football of the future and changing the world like the Hungarians did in 1953 with their epochal 6-3 victory over England. But Germany are not Hungary. They are a very good football team, and they played well, but Brazil had both hands in their own destruction -- and at least one foot as well. The first goal came from calamitous marking, the second from lethargic defending and all else from disorder and chaos. Toward the end of the first half, the Brazilian players were dead-eyed, shuffling after the Germans like zombies, lacking the cognitive functions to draw up any kind of strategy, content merely to trudge lifelessly in the direction of anything that moved. Their defending was horrific. Even if Neymar had been fit, he couldn't have done anything about the back line's inability to track runners. Even without Thiago Silva, Brazil fielded two Champions League-winning centre-backs in David Luiz and Dante. There is a bare minimum of competence and diligence expected from professional footballers. Too many men in yellow shirts fell well below those levels. Brazil 1-7 Germany -- reaction - Marcotti: Scolari at a loss to explain - Jones: Seven stages of grief for Brazil - Duarte: Haunting defeat for the Selecao - Delaney: Three Points - Brazil broken by Germany - Low: German plan worked perfectly - Behind the Numbers: Germany's historic win - Photo Gallery: Best of Brazil vs. Germany - Klose breaks World Cup goals record | Highlight - Social reaction: Brazil, did that just happen? A brief rally after halftime was a fig leaf of dignity, then the Germans tore even that away and stamped it into the ground. The Brazilian supporters -- those who weren't crying their eyes out or hurriedly leaving the stadium -- could only applaud their passing, with some of them shouting 'ole' to lighten the mood. Andre Schurrle's second-half strike, a spectacular volley, was the sort of goal that should have decided a game. Instead, it was just a heavy kick at a twitching body on the roadside. It seemed inappropriate to even celebrate. Scolari, in typical style, urged everyone to blame him. And they will. He surely won't survive this. But where do Brazil turn from here? How many of the players will ever be able to pull on a Brazil shirt again? With the Copa America next summer in Chile, a reboot is required if further humiliation is to be avoided. Perhaps the only real hope for the Brazilian people is that somewhere out there, a young boy is now comforting his crying father and telling him that he will avenge what happened this awful night. The difference is this time, it would help far more if he were a defender. Miroslav Klose's record-breaking goal against Brazil is merely a footnote in Germany's historic obliteration of the hosts of the 2014 World Cup. Let's spare a thought for Miroslav Klose, though. Just think how many times he has imagined scoring his record-breaking 16th World Cup goal. Just try to visualise what Klose must have seen in his mind's eye. The moment of glorious triumph. The love of the supporters. The respect of his teammates. He likely pictured himself being carried aloft the shoulders of the men he plays with as tens of thousands of people chanted his name, a name that would be etched in the history books for all eternity. In reality, Klose's historic strike wasn't even the most memorable thing that happened in the game. In fact, with the scoreline and the floods of tears from Luiz, Klose's historic strike is barely in the top three most memorable things. Poor Miroslav. Immortality has never been so anti-climatic.	sports
Brazil 1-7 Germany - World Cup hosts utterly humiliated in semfinal - ESPN FC	Brazil's dreams of making a return to a World Cup final in the Maracana were shattered in the most agonising manner as Germany inflicted on the hosts one of the most remarkable defeats in the 84-year history of this competition. Tears flowed like water in the Estadio Mineirao in Belo Horizonte as before even half-an-hour had gone, Brazil were 5-0 down, and the final scoreline was 7-1, equalling their worst-ever defeat, 6-0 to Uruguay back in 1920 before the World Cup had even begun. Brazil 1-7 Germany -- reaction - Marcotti: Scolari at a loss to explain - Jones: Seven stages of grief for Brazil - Duarte: Haunting defeat for the Selecao - Delaney: Three Points - Brazil broken by Germany - Low: German plan worked perfectly - Behind the Numbers: Germany's historic win - Photo Gallery: Best of Brazil vs. Germany - Klose breaks World Cup goals record | Highlight - Social reaction: Brazil, did that just happen? Two goals for Toni Kroos and Andre Schurrle , plus one each for Thomas Muller, Sami Khedira, and record-breaking 16th World Cup goal for Miroslav Klose saw the visitors delirious, while Brazil begins a period of soul-searching such as never before. Germany will go into Sunday's World Cup final at the Maracana to face Argentina or Holland on the highest of highs. The pain was so intense for Brazil, who had arrived at the Estadio Mineirao intent on honouring their missing talisman, Neymar. They tried to use his absence as an inspiration, parading slowly onto the field linked in crocodile formation, with stand-in captain David Luiz and goalkeeper Julio Cesar clutching Neymar's shirt as they belted out the national anthem. The opening period was always going to be a testing one for Germany, with the partisan crowd baying every Brazilian touch and tackle. Marcelo was cheered wildly after sending a 25-yard shot skimming a couple of yards wide, but there was a frantic feel to it, as though the Neymar emotion had spilled over into a frenzy, with Germany capable of punishing any slackness. That almost happened early on when Mesut Ozil delivered a sweet cross for Khedira to volley only for his shot to strike Kroos. A break by Khedira then led to the corner from which Germany took the lead in the 11th minute. Kroos took it, and it was straightforward enough but Brazil's marking went into meltdown and Muller slotted it home low past Julio Cesar while David Luiz beat the ground in frustration. Marcelo burst into the Germany penalty area and a pinpoint sliding tackle by Philipp Lahm stopped him in full stride but Brazil's high tempo only served to make them vulnerable on the break and Germany made them pay again, this time Klose becoming a World Cup's record-breaker. A delightful passing move saw Muller lay the ball off and although Julio Cesar stopped his first effort, Klose buried the rebound. Two minutes later and it was 3-0, Lahm's cross going all the way across the area for Kroos to slam home left-footed from 18 yards. Brazil's historic semifinal loss • Miroslav Klose now highest scorer in World Cup history with 16 goals. • Klose surpassed Brazilian striking legend Ronaldo to claim the record. • Germany scored five goals in 29 minutes, the fastest any team has ever done so in the World Cup. • Brazil had not conceded five goals in an entire World Cup since 1998. • The Selecao conceded 4 in 5 matches in 2010, 2 in 5 in 2006 and 4 in 7 in 2002. • Germany the first team to score five goals in a World Cup 1st half since Poland in 1974. • Brazil had never trailed by 4 goals in any World Cup match before today. (102 previous matches) • Germany now the all-time top scoring team in World Cup history with 221 goals. • Brazil the first host nation to lose a World Cup game by more than three goals.  Another two minutes, another goal. From a goal-kick Fernandinho was robbed by Khedira who unselfishly played in Kroos for a virtual tap-in for 4-0. By this time Brazil fans were in tears and a few leaving their seats, but the German machine marched on mercilessly. Less than half an hour gone and the hosts were 5-0 down. Mats Hummels strode forward and Ozil, who had come alive in this match, set up Khedira for a first-time finish. All over the pitch, in the stands, the executive box where FIFA president Sepp Blatter watched, in the Fan Fests on the beaches and those tens of millions tormented on TVs throughout Brazil, there was sheer disbelief. Scolari's half-time team talk must have been all about rescuing some pride, because it was a different Brazil who came out for the second half, with Paulinho on for the Fernandinho and Ramires for Hulk, with Low sending on Per Mertesacker for Hummels. Neuer had been barely tested in the first half but only he prevented Brazil getting on the scoresheet, first defying Oscar and then Paulinho. Julio Cesar had to be at his best to tip over Muller's curling effort from 25 yards, but Germany were not to be denied and Lahm's penetrating cross was struck home by substitute Schurrle. It was Chelsea midfielder Schurrle who piled on the agony, a breathtaking finish into the top corner after pulling down Muller's instinctive cross. Ozil should have made it an embarrassing eight but slid wide when through on goal before Oscar's crisp finish in the last minute provided a glimmer of light in the darkness. If Brazil wanted to erase the memories of that 1950 final defeat in the Maracana they have done so: this pain would have been infinitely more excruciating.	sports
Brazil's 7-1 loss to Germany in the World Cup semifinals their worst in history - ESPN FC	When this World Cup began, Luiz Felipe Scolari's objective was to give the Brazilian supporters a performance that would make them forget forever what happened in 1950 in the Maracana. Well ... mission accomplished. The Maracanazo, the shocking 2-1 defeat to Uruguay that cost Brazil the World Cup they assumed they'd already won, is now only the second worst night in their history. That result was so stunningly awful that poets compared it to Hiroshima. Pele's father burst into tears in front of the television at full time. His young son, just 10 years old at the time, according to legend, comforted him and promised he would grow up and win the World Cup himself. Many of the players responsible for that failure were pariahs for decades afterward. What will become of these players? They are millionaires, most of them several times over. They will continue to earn fortunes, regardless of what happened in Belo Horizonte. Their ignominy will not diminish their bank balance. And yet the embarrassment will be so much more public. Sixty-four years ago, media coverage was limited. Now, the faces of these players are known across the world. Their shame is universal, and there is nowhere to hide. There was no hint of what was to come when the national anthems were played. Brazil sang loudly, in customary style, while David Luiz and Julio Cesar held up Neymar's No. 10 shirt. In retrospect, they might have been better hanging it on a stick and planting it in the German penalty area. It would have made as much of an impact as Fred did. Brazil players applaud their disappointed fans after an embarrassing 7-1 defeat at the hands of the German squad. Perhaps it would have been easier to take if this were simply a case of a wonderful team playing the football of the future and changing the world like the Hungarians did in 1953 with their epochal 6-3 victory over England. But Germany are not Hungary. They are a very good football team, and they played well, but Brazil had both hands in their own destruction -- and at least one foot as well. The first goal came from calamitous marking, the second from lethargic defending and all else from disorder and chaos. Toward the end of the first half, the Brazilian players were dead-eyed, shuffling after the Germans like zombies, lacking the cognitive functions to draw up any kind of strategy, content merely to trudge lifelessly in the direction of anything that moved. Their defending was horrific. Even if Neymar had been fit, he couldn't have done anything about the back line's inability to track runners. Even without Thiago Silva, Brazil fielded two Champions League-winning centre-backs in David Luiz and Dante. There is a bare minimum of competence and diligence expected from professional footballers. Too many men in yellow shirts fell well below those levels. Brazil 1-7 Germany -- reaction - Marcotti: Scolari at a loss to explain - Jones: Seven stages of grief for Brazil - Duarte: Haunting defeat for the Selecao - Delaney: Three Points - Brazil broken by Germany - Low: German plan worked perfectly - Behind the Numbers: Germany's historic win - Photo Gallery: Best of Brazil vs. Germany - Klose breaks World Cup goals record | Highlight - Social reaction: Brazil, did that just happen? A brief rally after halftime was a fig leaf of dignity, then the Germans tore even that away and stamped it into the ground. The Brazilian supporters -- those who weren't crying their eyes out or hurriedly leaving the stadium -- could only applaud their passing, with some of them shouting 'ole' to lighten the mood. Andre Schurrle's second-half strike, a spectacular volley, was the sort of goal that should have decided a game. Instead, it was just a heavy kick at a twitching body on the roadside. It seemed inappropriate to even celebrate. Scolari, in typical style, urged everyone to blame him. And they will. He surely won't survive this. But where do Brazil turn from here? How many of the players will ever be able to pull on a Brazil shirt again? With the Copa America next summer in Chile, a reboot is required if further humiliation is to be avoided. Perhaps the only real hope for the Brazilian people is that somewhere out there, a young boy is now comforting his crying father and telling him that he will avenge what happened this awful night. The difference is this time, it would help far more if he were a defender. Miroslav Klose's record-breaking goal against Brazil is merely a footnote in Germany's historic obliteration of the hosts of the 2014 World Cup. Let's spare a thought for Miroslav Klose, though. Just think how many times he has imagined scoring his record-breaking 16th World Cup goal. Just try to visualise what Klose must have seen in his mind's eye. The moment of glorious triumph. The love of the supporters. The respect of his teammates. He likely pictured himself being carried aloft the shoulders of the men he plays with as tens of thousands of people chanted his name, a name that would be etched in the history books for all eternity. In reality, Klose's historic strike wasn't even the most memorable thing that happened in the game. In fact, with the scoreline and the floods of tears from Luiz, Klose's historic strike is barely in the top three most memorable things. Poor Miroslav. Immortality has never been so anti-climatic.	sports
Brazil 1-7 Germany - World Cup hosts utterly humiliated in semfinal - ESPN FC	Brazil's dreams of making a return to a World Cup final in the Maracana were shattered in the most agonising manner as Germany inflicted on the hosts one of the most remarkable defeats in the 84-year history of this competition. Tears flowed like water in the Estadio Mineirao in Belo Horizonte as before even half-an-hour had gone, Brazil were 5-0 down, and the final scoreline was 7-1, equalling their worst-ever defeat, 6-0 to Uruguay back in 1920 before the World Cup had even begun. Brazil 1-7 Germany -- reaction - Marcotti: Scolari at a loss to explain - Jones: Seven stages of grief for Brazil - Duarte: Haunting defeat for the Selecao - Delaney: Three Points - Brazil broken by Germany - Low: German plan worked perfectly - Behind the Numbers: Germany's historic win - Photo Gallery: Best of Brazil vs. Germany - Klose breaks World Cup goals record | Highlight - Social reaction: Brazil, did that just happen? Two goals for Toni Kroos and Andre Schurrle , plus one each for Thomas Muller, Sami Khedira, and record-breaking 16th World Cup goal for Miroslav Klose saw the visitors delirious, while Brazil begins a period of soul-searching such as never before. Germany will go into Sunday's World Cup final at the Maracana to face Argentina or Holland on the highest of highs. The pain was so intense for Brazil, who had arrived at the Estadio Mineirao intent on honouring their missing talisman, Neymar. They tried to use his absence as an inspiration, parading slowly onto the field linked in crocodile formation, with stand-in captain David Luiz and goalkeeper Julio Cesar clutching Neymar's shirt as they belted out the national anthem. The opening period was always going to be a testing one for Germany, with the partisan crowd baying every Brazilian touch and tackle. Marcelo was cheered wildly after sending a 25-yard shot skimming a couple of yards wide, but there was a frantic feel to it, as though the Neymar emotion had spilled over into a frenzy, with Germany capable of punishing any slackness. That almost happened early on when Mesut Ozil delivered a sweet cross for Khedira to volley only for his shot to strike Kroos. A break by Khedira then led to the corner from which Germany took the lead in the 11th minute. Kroos took it, and it was straightforward enough but Brazil's marking went into meltdown and Muller slotted it home low past Julio Cesar while David Luiz beat the ground in frustration. Marcelo burst into the Germany penalty area and a pinpoint sliding tackle by Philipp Lahm stopped him in full stride but Brazil's high tempo only served to make them vulnerable on the break and Germany made them pay again, this time Klose becoming a World Cup's record-breaker. A delightful passing move saw Muller lay the ball off and although Julio Cesar stopped his first effort, Klose buried the rebound. Two minutes later and it was 3-0, Lahm's cross going all the way across the area for Kroos to slam home left-footed from 18 yards.

Sporting humiliations after Germany thrash Brazil 7-1 - ESPN FC	Brazil's World Cup hopes were not just ended but shattered in the most emphatic of styles by Germany on Tuesday night. Four goals in the space of just seven first-half minutes silenced an entire nation and the shell-shocked hosts eventually lost their semifinal 7-1. Here are some other results which have resulted in red faces. ENGLAND'S CRICKETERS England toured the West Indies in 1994 and in the Third Test at the Queen's Park Oval in Trinidad, were set 194 to win after Andy Caddick returned six for 65 to put his side in control. But the tourists were soon left reeling with Alec Stewart their only batsman to score double figures with 18. England were humbled out for 46 and lost by 147 runs. Fast forward to 2013 and another England team were torn apart on foreign soil. After retaining the Ashes at home in the Summer, Alastair Cook's men took an alarming fast track to a 5-0 Ashes whitewash with a 281-run defeat inside three days in the final Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Cook's hapless tourists arguably plumbed new depths in an already embarrassing campaign as they collapsed yet again, in notional pursuit of a world-record 448 to win, to 166 all out. MANCHESTER UNITED 1-6 MANCHESTER CITY Mario Balotelli provided the spark as City stormed Old Trafford to humiliate rivals United 6-1 as the Italy striker struck twice against 10-man United, who saw defender Jonny Evans sent off. Edin Dzeko scored twice and Sergio Aguero and David Silva added to the tally, while United claimed a consolation through Darren Fletcher but they were ran ragged in the dying moments as City struck three times after the 88th minute. City's victory lifted them five points clear of rivals United and shattered a host of statistics. In recording only their second win at Old Trafford since 1974, City inflicted United's first home defeat since April 2010 and ended their run of 19 consecutive home league wins. SEATTLE SEAHAWKS 43-8 DENVER BRONCOS The Seattle Seahawks produced one of the most dominant performances in Super Bowl history as Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos were crushed 43-8. Ahead of the clash, much focus was on Manning -- just voted the NFL's MVP for the fifth time in his career having led the most prolific offence of all time this year. But, after being gifted a safety on the first play for the quickest ever Super Bowl score, the anticipated 'contest' quickly became a blow-out as Seattle controlled proceedings throughout. CHELSEA 6-0 ARSENAL Arsenal embarrassingly capitulated in Arsene Wenger's 1,000th match in charge with a 6-0 loss to Premier League leaders Chelsea after a spectacular implosion and an horrendous mistake by referee Andre Marriner. The Frenchman watched on helplessly after two goals in three first-half minutes from Samuel Eto'o and Andre Schurrle gave Chelsea a handsome lead before Marriner sent off Kieran Gibbs for a handball committed by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Eden Hazard converted a penalty to give the Blues a 3-0 advantage, Oscar added a fourth before the interval, a fifth after 66 minutes and Mohamed Salah sealed the win. MIKE TYSON vs. BUSTER DOUGLAS One part humiliation, one part shock for this. Tyson was the undispusted heavyweight champion of the world when he met 42/1 rank outsider Buster Douglas in Tokyo in 1990. 'Iron Mike' got it all horribly wrong, though, and was knocked out in the 10th round for a result that remains one of boxing's most famous. Tyson would never be at the peak of his powers again and his career became more infamous than famous. RORY McILROY, THE MASTERS Northern Irishman McIlroy played near perfect golf across the first three days in Augusta to lead the field by four shots in pursuit of his first major. His fourth round was the worst recorded by any professional leading after the third round of the Masters. One over after the front nine, he still lead, but he signed for 80 and finished tied for 15th. To his credit, though, he headed back to America two months later to win the US Open.	sports

Netherlands vs. Argentina: 50-50 Challenge - ESPN FC	It's a repeat of the 1978 World Cup final as the Netherlands face Argentina in Sao Paulo on Wednesday, with just one more match between the teams and a place at the Maracana. The Netherlands reached the final in 2010 while Argentina, winners 36 years ago, are in the semifinals for the fourth time in their history. Elko Born (Netherlands) and Sam Kelly (Argentina) preview the clash. Sum up your tournament so far Elko Born: The tournament has been a dream so far, with everything going right at exactly the right moment, from Robin van Persie's wonder goal in the first match to Arjen Robben's form and manager Louis van Gaal's audacious substitution against Costa Rica. There is almost a feeling the match against Argentina can hardly go wrong. Should the Argentines take the lead then surely Robben or Van Persie will step up or Van Gaal will come up with more magic. Sam Kelly: Historic. It's not been as free-scoring as Argentina would have liked and it's been very nervy at times, but the Rubicon has been crossed; for the first time since 1930, Argentina have reached a World Cup semifinal without either being the host nation (1978) or having Diego Maradona in the squad (1986 and 1990). And for the first time since losing the 1990 final -- the third World Cup final out of four that Argentina had featured in -- they've got past the quarters. It's not been all sunshine and roses. They've lost Angel Di Maria for the semifinal at least and there might be a minor concern about some of the finishing on Saturday, because in truth given how the game went, Argentina should probably have beaten Belgium by more than one goal. But key changes were made and worked, and key players who hadn't previously stepped up (I'm looking at you, Gonzalo Higuain) did so magnificently. Everything might finally be coming together. World Cup history between the two countries EB: There is, of course, Dennis Bergkamp's classic goal in the quarterfinal of the World Cup in 1998. But the most memorable match between the Netherlands and Argentina was played in 1978, when the countries faced each other in the final of the World Cup. The Netherlands, still disappointed from narrowly missing out on the ultimate prize in 1974, lost 2-1 after extra time and were once again left empty-handed. This, as you can imagine, has not been forgotten. Among fans and in the media, the word "revenge" is being tossed around. SK: This will be the fifth meeting between these nations at the World Cup. The Netherlands have won two -- a 4-0 win in Gelsenkirchen on their way to the final in 1974, and a 2-1 win in Marseille in 1998, decided by that brilliant Bergkamp effort as Elko says. The most recent meeting, during the 2006 group stage, brought the only competitive draw between the sides, a 0-0 in Frankfurt. Argentina's sole World Cup win -- indeed, their only win, because they've never won a friendly -- against the Netherlands was the 3-1 extra-time victory (it had finished 1-1 after 90 minutes) in the Estadio Monumental in the final of the 1978 World Cup. For most Argentines, 1978 is a tainted victory due to the military junta's attempts (very possibly successful) to swing things the home side's way. As such, taking out the Netherlands this time round could also be painted as a win over one of the darker parts of Argentina's own history (off the pitch as well as on it). What are your expectations for the rest of the tournament? EB: Ahead of the tournament most fans did not expect the Netherlands to get very far. Consequently, reaching the semifinal can already be seen as a huge success. But after a series of convincing victories, the Dutch now think they can win the World Cup and with the empowering feeling of confidence now instilled in the Oranje, it is difficult to simply dismiss this assertion completely. After the lost finals of 1974, 1978 and 2010, will it finally happen? Or is desire clouding judgement too much, and have the Dutch been a little lucky to get this far? - Macintosh: Van Gaal has gumption to spare SK: Two very tight semifinals but, just possibly, a more open final. As for how Argentina will do in their final two matches, they need to improve still, but the good news is that they already seem to have begun to step things up somewhat. Excellent in the first half against a Belgium side that offered them more space than they'd had in the previous round, they could have been further ahead but controlled the game pretty effectively even without the ball in the second half. Of the changes last time, Marcos Rojo should return from suspension to replace Jose Basanta at left-back, but Martin Demichelis will surely keep his place alongside Ezequiel Garay in the centre of defence; Demichelis looked far better than Federico Fernandez, and crucially Garay also looked more at ease with the experience of the Manchester City man alongside him. Given their potential for improvement and the fact they've done so in small bursts so far in the tournament, I think Argentina are narrow favourites for the semi -- particularly with Nigel de Jong injured for the Netherlands. Angel Di Maria's injury is a setback for Argentina, who have benefitted from the Real Madrid man's tireless running. Key battle EB: As one of the best footballers of the world, Lionel Messi is the man the Netherlands fear most, and without the injured defensive midfielder Nigel de Jong, the relatively inexperienced Dutch defence will have to be on their guard. In the case of Messi, though -- and in true Dutch fashion -- the best defence might be the attack. The battle between Argentina and the Netherlands will be a battle between Messi and Robben, the Netherlands' star man up front. On the day of the semifinal, who will perform best? And more importantly: Who will score the most goals? SK: Messi vs. Georginio Wijnaldum. In De Jong's absence, Wijnaldum (and Wesley Sneijder) seems likely to be asked to sit a little deeper in midfield to counter Messi's threat in front of the Dutch defence. If that sounds risky, it could well be; we saw in the first half against Belgium how much Messi finally enjoyed being given the space that came with having just one man marking him, as he produced some wonderful probing passes, including probably the through-ball of the finals so far to set Di Maria up for the shot from which the winger seemed to pick up his injury. It's clear -- all but impossible to deny -- that Argentina rely on Messi, and even with their bit-by-bit improvements so far, that's not likely to change here, particularly with Di Maria out of the equation. If Messi gets the space in midfield to pick up a head of steam on the ball, he could be very dangerous -- perhaps decisively so. Elsewhere on the pitch, how Marcos Rojo deals with Arjen Robben on the Dutch right/Argentine left will also prove important. - Vickery: Argentina fail to thrill Prediction EB: Having seen Dennis Bergkamp's wonder goal against Argentina in 1998 as a child, Robben or Van Persie will feel inspired to do something similar in the dying seconds of the match. The Netherlands will win 2-1. SK: It's very tight to call, but I'm going for Argentina to edge it by a goal again; if I were Dutch, the lack of bite in defensive midfield would be a worry coming up against Messi, while Argentina's own defensive errors were notably less of a problem with Demichelis stepping into the back line against Belgium.	sports
Luiz Felipe Scolari takes responsibility for Brazil's defeat to Germany - ESPN FC	After Brazil suffered their "worst loss" in their most important home game in 64 years, all coach Luiz Felipe Scolari could do was take the blame for his team's 7-1 thrashing at the hands of Germany. "The catastrophic result can be shared with the whole group, but the choice and who decided the tactical lineup -- I did. The person who is responsible is me," Scolari said. Brazil 1-7 Germany -- reaction - Marcotti: Scolari at a loss to explain - Jones: Seven stages of grief for Brazil - Duarte: Haunting defeat for the Selecao - Delaney: Three Points - Brazil broken by Germany - Low: German plan worked perfectly - Behind the Numbers: Germany's historic win - Photo Gallery: Best of Brazil vs. Germany - Klose breaks World Cup goals record | Highlight - Social reaction: Brazil, did that just happen? Brazil were undone when Germany scored five goals within 30 minutes in the first half, including four goals in a seven-minute span. "My message is for the Brazilian people that we tried to do what we could do," Scolari said. "We did what we think was our best and we lost to a great team who in six or seven minutes, ended the game in an extraordinary manner. "I'm sorry that we were not able to get to the final and we will continue to honour what our team is and fight for third place." Brazil appeared helpless during Germany's onslaught, with Scolari saying "I think everyone blanked out." "We tried to organise, but there was nothing we could do at that moment," the coach said. Brazil were lacking injured star forward Neymar, but Scolari said his presence would not have made a difference. "There's no regret, but it didn't work out in 10 minutes of the match today. The German team was fantastic," he said. "They probably could have done it with Neymar on the field as well. "Let's not try to find an excuse. What happened is that Germany had a fantastic rhythm and defined the match. Germany made use of those moments and Neymar has nothing to do with that. He would not have made a difference to defend all of the goals. Germany would have done this regardless." Brazil were also missing centre-back Thiago Silva, who was suspended after earning his second yellow card, leaving David Luiz to manage the back with Dante, who was making his debut at the tournament. Luiz was left in tears after the match as he walked off the pitch. "I am sorry we couldn't give the fans happiness," he said. "We didn't get it and I ask all of Brazil to forgive me. I only wanted to see all of Brazil smile. This was the most important match of my life." David Luiz and Brazil's defence were shredded without Thiago Silva on the pitch. Right-back Dani Alves was at a loss for solutions to Brazil's first-half problems. "This has been like a nightmare you have about football," he said. "Never in football match has this ever happened to me. Theirs is a team very well put together, very complete in all zones. We lost the match in six minutes. In all of my 31 years I have never seen six minutes that cannot be explained as ours were." Scolari said he tried to rally his players after the early setback, just as he will have to rally them to compete in the third-place match against the loser of Argentina and the Netherlands on Saturday. "I did my job as I've always done it anywhere. I did what I thought was best," Scolari said. "It was a terrible defeat because of the result, but we tried to make it respectable. We all lost, but don't forget there's a match on Saturday, and we can still be third." Scolari also took solace in the fact that many of his players will return for the 2018 World Cup, while implying Germany's players were nearing the edge of their careers. "This team of Germany played the 2008 Euro and 2010 World Cup. Half of our team will play at the next World Cup," Scolari said. "We will see at least 13, 14, 15 players in 2018. It's our worst loss, but we have to learn how to deal with it." It remains to be seen if Scolari will be retained to guide his players in Russia, though Scolari would not admit any regrets on Tuesday night. "Regret what?" he asked. "I don't have any regrets for the choices I made, but I have to put up with the consequences."	sports

Brazil 1-7 Germany - World Cup hosts utterly humiliated in semfinal - ESPN FC	Brazil's dreams of making a return to a World Cup final in the Maracana were shattered in the most agonising manner as Germany inflicted on the hosts one of the most remarkable defeats in the 84-year history of this competition. Tears flowed like water in the Estadio Mineirao in Belo Horizonte as before even half-an-hour had gone, Brazil were 5-0 down, and the final scoreline was 7-1, equalling their worst-ever defeat, 6-0 to Uruguay back in 1920 before the World Cup had even begun. Brazil 1-7 Germany -- reaction - Marcotti: Scolari at a loss to explain - Jones: Seven stages of grief for Brazil - Duarte: Haunting defeat for the Selecao - Delaney: Three Points - Brazil broken by Germany - Low: German plan worked perfectly - Behind the Numbers: Germany's historic win - Photo Gallery: Best of Brazil vs. Germany - Klose breaks World Cup goals record | Highlight - Social reaction: Brazil, did that just happen? Two goals for Toni Kroos and Andre Schurrle , plus one each for Thomas Muller, Sami Khedira, and record-breaking 16th World Cup goal for Miroslav Klose saw the visitors delirious, while Brazil begins a period of soul-searching such as never before. Germany will go into Sunday's World Cup final at the Maracana to face Argentina or Holland on the highest of highs. The pain was so intense for Brazil, who had arrived at the Estadio Mineirao intent on honouring their missing talisman, Neymar. They tried to use his absence as an inspiration, parading slowly onto the field linked in crocodile formation, with stand-in captain David Luiz and goalkeeper Julio Cesar clutching Neymar's shirt as they belted out the national anthem. The opening period was always going to be a testing one for Germany, with the partisan crowd baying every Brazilian touch and tackle. Marcelo was cheered wildly after sending a 25-yard shot skimming a couple of yards wide, but there was a frantic feel to it, as though the Neymar emotion had spilled over into a frenzy, with Germany capable of punishing any slackness. That almost happened early on when Mesut Ozil delivered a sweet cross for Khedira to volley only for his shot to strike Kroos. A break by Khedira then led to the corner from which Germany took the lead in the 11th minute. Kroos took it, and it was straightforward enough but Brazil's marking went into meltdown and Muller slotted it home low past Julio Cesar while David Luiz beat the ground in frustration. Marcelo burst into the Germany penalty area and a pinpoint sliding tackle by Philipp Lahm stopped him in full stride but Brazil's high tempo only served to make them vulnerable on the break and Germany made them pay again, this time Klose becoming a World Cup's record-breaker. A delightful passing move saw Muller lay the ball off and although Julio Cesar stopped his first effort, Klose buried the rebound. Two minutes later and it was 3-0, Lahm's cross going all the way across the area for Kroos to slam home left-footed from 18 yards. Brazil's historic semifinal loss • Miroslav Klose now highest scorer in World Cup history with 16 goals. • Klose surpassed Brazilian striking legend Ronaldo to claim the record. • Germany scored five goals in 29 minutes, the fastest any team has ever done so in the World Cup. • Brazil had not conceded five goals in an entire World Cup since 1998. • The Selecao conceded 4 in 5 matches in 2010, 2 in 5 in 2006 and 4 in 7 in 2002. • Germany the first team to score five goals in a World Cup 1st half since Poland in 1974. • Brazil had never trailed by 4 goals in any World Cup match before today. (102 previous matches) • Germany now the all-time top scoring team in World Cup history with 221 goals. • Brazil the first host nation to lose a World Cup game by more than three goals.  Another two minutes, another goal. From a goal-kick Fernandinho was robbed by Khedira who unselfishly played in Kroos for a virtual tap-in for 4-0. By this time Brazil fans were in tears and a few leaving their seats, but the German machine marched on mercilessly. Less than half an hour gone and the hosts were 5-0 down. Mats Hummels strode forward and Ozil, who had come alive in this match, set up Khedira for a first-time finish. All over the pitch, in the stands, the executive box where FIFA president Sepp Blatter watched, in the Fan Fests on the beaches and those tens of millions tormented on TVs throughout Brazil, there was sheer disbelief. Scolari's half-time team talk must have been all about rescuing some pride, because it was a different Brazil who came out for the second half, with Paulinho on for the Fernandinho and Ramires for Hulk, with Low sending on Per Mertesacker for Hummels. Neuer had been barely tested in the first half but only he prevented Brazil getting on the scoresheet, first defying Oscar and then Paulinho. Julio Cesar had to be at his best to tip over Muller's curling effort from 25 yards, but Germany were not to be denied and Lahm's penetrating cross was struck home by substitute Schurrle. It was Chelsea midfielder Schurrle who piled on the agony, a breathtaking finish into the top corner after pulling down Muller's instinctive cross. Ozil should have made it an embarrassing eight but slid wide when through on goal before Oscar's crisp finish in the last minute provided a glimmer of light in the darkness. If Brazil wanted to erase the memories of that 1950 final defeat in the Maracana they have done so: this pain would have been infinitely more excruciating.	sports
Brazil's 7 stages of grief against Germany in the World Cup - ESPN FC	SAO PAULO -- The fireworks, blasts like cannons, were going off hours before the game. Not very many went off after. Anticipation had given way to humiliation, and by now this giant city seems to have accepted it. Brazil's historic defeat by the Germans might have been just bad enough to save us. There have been fears, spoken of surprisingly often and openly, about what terrible things would happen if Brazil failed to win this World Cup -- something seen by some here almost as a divine right, a function of pure destiny. Mostly, people had talked about how sideways the world might go if the hosts lost to the hated Argentines in the final. Then every clamp and governor that had been thrown onto this crackling country -- most of the pre-tournament anger having subsided once the games began -- would be released. In the absence of any reason for unity, a potentially violent division would return. It turns out a more decisive cataclysm was coming. Tens of thousands, fenced in by police and metal barricades, packed into the FIFA Fan Fest in Sao Paulo's downtown core before Tuesday night's game. There were concerts and banners and sloshing cups of beer, the familiar motions of celebration, but in truth it was already a kind of limited buoyancy. With Neymar's injury and Thiago Silva's suspension, local hopes had been muted. But they were still there, if under the surface. The anthem wasn't sung so much as it was shouted, and then the whistle blew. Brazil 1-7 Germany -- reaction - Marcotti: Scolari at a loss to explain - Jones: Seven stages of grief for Brazil - Duarte: Haunting defeat for the Selecao - Delaney: Three Points - Brazil broken by Germany - Low: German plan worked perfectly - Behind the Numbers: Germany's historic win - Photo Gallery: Best of Brazil vs. Germany - Klose breaks World Cup goals record | Highlight - Social reaction: Brazil, did that just happen? Then the Germans did what they did -- and so quickly -- with each of their seven goals serving as another of the makeshift stages of accelerated Brazilian grief. The first was met with anxiety, the second with anger, the third with disappointment, the fourth with disbelief. Then came bemusement, surprisingly enough -- some percentage of the thinning crowd that remained actually began cheering for the Germans -- and then understanding and finally acceptance. If there were still a bomb set to go off, the late Brazilian goal, that slim measure of pride, cut the last wire. By then, though, there was no longer any sense of real danger here, no feeling that riots were about to kick off. There were too many police, for starters, but more importantly, there wasn't really anything for the crowd to be angry about. This was a brutal defeat, but it contained no injustice or heartbreak. Brazil -- this Brazil -- just weren't good enough to win the World Cup, even given the advantages of home. They had barely beaten Chile, and they had struggled to hold on against the Colombians. Brazilians had remained hopeful their boys would continue to win, but it felt more and more as though they had stopped believing they would. After they had been made doubtless, they left and went home, or they stumbled into bars in search of one last commiserating drink. Some even thought to blow their air horns, almost ironic screams of defiance against the dark. Maybe the coming days will turn ugly, and fears will come true. Maybe this country will feel the way any of us does when houseguests linger too long. Maybe, for the first time in its history, Brazil will want the party to be over. But right now it doesn't feel that way. It doesn't feel like much of anything. Right now Sao Paulo feels like any other city in the world, except bigger, lit up, buzzing and perhaps even relieved to have joined the World Cup's ever expanding ranks of the abruptly detached.	sports
Germany countered Brazil's passion with calm, Joachim Low says - ESPN FC	Germany's quick counter-attacks worked exactly as planned, coach Joachim Low said after their 7-1 dismantling of Brazil in Tuesday's semifinal. Entering a raucous Estadio Mineirao, Germany silenced the hosts' fans with a five-goal outbreak inside 30 minutes, and Low said it was important his team remained clear-headed.

"It was important to counter their passion and emotions with calmness, patience and persistence, also with courage and believe in our own strength," Low said on German network ZDF. "Brazil were shocked, they did not expect that." "We scored five goals in 18 minutes. It's clear that they were shocked. "We knew that if we are quick on the counters, and go straight into attack after winning balls they will be disorganised. We played well in the first half. "But it's not over yet. And humbleness will suit us just fine. We might have recorded a huge win, but we must stay focused until Sunday. The players are ready to make that last step." Toni Kroos and Germany hit Brazil hard in the first half and never looked back in a 7-1 semifinal victory. Low likened the feelings the host country must be feeling to Germany's own defeat to Italy in the semifinals of the 2006 World Cup that Die Mannschaft hosted, and offered sympathy to Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari. "I can understand what Scolari is going through," Low said. "It's a bit like in 2006, when Italy beat us in the semifinal. The whole country wants you to make it to the final. I feel sorry for him." Defender Mats Hummels admitted that the team realised at halftime what nearly every fan watching around the world already knew -- Germany had won the game before the break. "It's unbelievable, incredible what happened on the pitch," Hummels said. "I don't think something like that has happened too often. We now want to make the final step. It was quieter in the dressing room than after a tight match. Without sounding arrogant, we knew we were through at halftime." Nearly lost in the shuffle was Miroslav Klose's record-breaking goal. He now stands alone with 16 career goals at the World Cup, taking the record from Brazil's Ronaldo. "I am so happy for Miroslav Klose," Low said. "That he got the record in a match against the host nation, it's an incredible achievement." Toni Kroos, who scored twice in Germany's first-half onslaught, was named man of the match. "It was an impressive match and from the first minute, we had the impression that something was possible," Kroos said. "Brazil were not clear in what they wanted to do and we took advantage of our opportunities. We played an outstanding match. "If somebody had said before that we would win 7-1, I wouldn't have believed it. After the first match, I said we're here to become World Champions. We're not champions yet and will have an extremely difficult step in order to achieve our goal. We were happy in the dressing room, but let's not forget there is still one match ahead of us."	sports

Luiz Felipe Scolari takes responsibility for Brazil's defeat to Germany - ESPN FC	After Brazil suffered their "worst loss" in their most important home game in 64 years, all coach Luiz Felipe Scolari could do was take the blame for his team's 7-1 thrashing at the hands of Germany. "The catastrophic result can be shared with the whole group, but the choice and who decided the tactical lineup -- I did. The person who is responsible is me," Scolari said. Brazil 1-7 Germany -- reaction - Marcotti: Scolari at a loss to explain - Jones: Seven stages of grief for Brazil - Duarte: Haunting defeat for the Selecao - Delaney: Three Points - Brazil broken by Germany - Low: German plan worked perfectly - Behind the Numbers: Germany's historic win - Photo Gallery: Best of Brazil vs. Germany - Klose breaks World Cup goals record | Highlight - Social reaction: Brazil, did that just happen? Brazil were undone when Germany scored five goals within 30 minutes in the first half, including four goals in a seven-minute span. "My message is for the Brazilian people that we tried to do what we could do," Scolari said. "We did what we think was our best and we lost to a great team who in six or seven minutes, ended the game in an extraordinary manner. "I'm sorry that we were not able to get to the final and we will continue to honour what our team is and fight for third place." Brazil appeared helpless during Germany's onslaught, with Scolari saying "I think everyone blanked out." "We tried to organise, but there was nothing we could do at that moment," the coach said. Brazil were lacking injured star forward Neymar, but Scolari said his presence would not have made a difference. "There's no regret, but it didn't work out in 10 minutes of the match today. The German team was fantastic," he said. "They probably could have done it with Neymar on the field as well. "Let's not try to find an excuse. What happened is that Germany had a fantastic rhythm and defined the match. Germany made use of those moments and Neymar has nothing to do with that. He would not have made a difference to defend all of the goals. Germany would have done this regardless." Brazil were also missing centre-back Thiago Silva, who was suspended after earning his second yellow card, leaving David Luiz to manage the back with Dante, who was making his debut at the tournament. Luiz was left in tears after the match as he walked off the pitch. "I am sorry we couldn't give the fans happiness," he said. "We didn't get it and I ask all of Brazil to forgive me. I only wanted to see all of Brazil smile. This was the most important match of my life." David Luiz and Brazil's defence were shredded without Thiago Silva on the pitch. Right-back Dani Alves was at a loss for solutions to Brazil's first-half problems. "This has been like a nightmare you have about football," he said. "Never in football match has this ever happened to me. Theirs is a team very well put together, very complete in all zones. We lost the match in six minutes. In all of my 31 years I have never seen six minutes that cannot be explained as ours were." Scolari said he tried to rally his players after the early setback, just as he will have to rally them to compete in the third-place match against the loser of Argentina and the Netherlands on Saturday. "I did my job as I've always done it anywhere. I did what I thought was best," Scolari said. "It was a terrible defeat because of the result, but we tried to make it respectable. We all lost, but don't forget there's a match on Saturday, and we can still be third." Scolari also took solace in the fact that many of his players will return for the 2018 World Cup, while implying Germany's players were nearing the edge of their careers. "This team of Germany played the 2008 Euro and 2010 World Cup. Half of our team will play at the next World Cup," Scolari said. "We will see at least 13, 14, 15 players in 2018. It's our worst loss, but we have to learn how to deal with it." It remains to be seen if Scolari will be retained to guide his players in Russia, though Scolari would not admit any regrets on Tuesday night. "Regret what?" he asked. "I don't have any regrets for the choices I made, but I have to put up with the consequences."	sports
Germany striker Miroslav Klose sets new World Cup scoring record - ESPN FC	Miroslav Klose netted in Germany's 7-1 win over Brazil in the semifinals on Tuesday to become the all-time leading World Cup goalscorer with 16. Klose, 36, had already pulled level with Brazilian legend Ronaldo when he scored in the 71st minute of Germany's clash with Ghana and went one better in the semis in Belo Horizonte. The striker -- who became the first player to ever appear in four World Cup semifinals -- put Joachim Low's side into a 2-0 lead with a 23rd-minute strike.  Top World Cup goalscorers 16 - Miroslav Klose (GER) -  23 games 15 - Ronaldo (BRA) - 19 games 14 - Gerd Muller (GER) - 13 games 13 - Just Fontaine (FRA) - 6 games 12 - Pele (BRA) - 14 games 11 - Sandor Kocsis (HUN) - 5 games 11 - Jurgen Klinsmann (GER) - 17 games 10 - Helmut Rahn - (GER) - 10 games 10 - Gabriel Batistuta (ARG) - 12 games 10 - Teofilo Cubillas (PER) - 13 games Klose's 15th goal came in his 20th World Cup appearance against Ghana and, after failing to score against the USA or make an appearance against Algeria in the round of 16, his 16th goal came in his 23rd, and he has scored at four consecutive tournaments -- only the third player to achieve that feat after Brazil legend Pele and West Germany's Uwe Seeler.  "One strike is not enough for me. I need to add more," Klose said before breaking the record. "I've got brutal mind, always prepare for everything. I don't take any offence [when not starting], I know that I can always help the team, in whatever way. I am ready, you already saw that against Ghana." In 2002, Klose scored five goals, all of them headers as an ageing Germany side progressed to the final. He added another five on home soil in 2006, where he also won the Golden Boot, before netting four more in South Africa in 2010.

Alejandro Sabella hails Lionel Messi has best player in the world - ESPN FC	SAO PAULO -- Normally a reserved man who avoids hype, Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella isn't shy about declaring Lionel Messi to be the best player in the world. Comparing the Argentina captain with Arjen Robben of the Netherlands and Brazil's Neymar, Sabella on Tuesday held up Messi as the undisputed No. 1. "Robben is a great player. He is very important for Holland. Like Neymar is for Brazil and Messi for Argentina," Sabella said. "Each of them is important for their teams, but Messi is the best of them all." After a disappointing World Cup four years ago, Messi has carried Argentina into the semifinals in Brazil, scoring four goals -- the same tally Neymar reached before injury ruled him out of the tournament. Robben, who faces Argentina in the second semifinal on Wednesday, has scored three. Though he's been named world player of the year for times for his accomplishments with Barcelona, Messi hasn't had the same kind of success with Argentina, who haven't won a major title since the 1993 Copa America. Lionel Messi is more important to Argentina than any other player is to any other team, says Alejandro Sabella. This is the first time since 1990 that Argentina have reached a World Cup semifinal, which Sabella said was a victory in itself. "After 24 years Argentina is among the four best teams in the world," Sabella said. "I think this group of players has already won. Let's see if we can win even more." If they do win the semifinal, Argentina won't have to worry about rivals Brazil in the title game. Sabella was just as stunned as everyone else to see Brazil lose 7-1 to Germany in the first semifinal, a game Argentina's players watched the end of on TV at Itaquerao Stadium, even delaying their training session for around 20 minutes. Sabella said the heavy defeat for Brazil was clearly "not normal." "But in football you have to expect these things," Sabella said. "It's football. It's the most illogical of sports. Things happen that you cannot foresee."	sports
Robin van Persie doubtful for Argentina tie - ESPN FC	Netherlands captain Robin van Persie may miss Wednesday's World Cup semifinal against Argentina, as he is struggling with an upset stomach. Van Persie, who has looked off the pace during the Oranje's two knockout-stage matches so far, trained away from the main group of players on Tuesday along with defender Daryl Janmaat. Netherlands vs. Argentina: July 9, 4 ET (ESPN and WatchESPN) - Stats: Diego Maradona vs. Lionel Messi - McIntyre: Superstars collide in Messi vs. Robben - Brewin: Van Gaal's management style - Brassell: Semifinalists have much to lose - Honigstein: Kuyt an unsung hero for the Dutch - Cox: Key semifinal matchups - Marcotti: Then there were four at the World Cup - Five Aside: Dutch, Argentina look to overcome past And Netherlands coach Louis van Gaal confirmed on the eve of the Albiceleste game in Sao Paulo that the striker, who has scored three goals in Brazil, is a serious doubt. "He has a stomach problem, an intestinal problem. I don't know [if he will play],'' Van Gaal told his prematch news conference. "I will decide [on Wednesday]. "Van Persie is our captain, so he is very important to us. In principle my captain always plays, but he has to be fit. "In general, I give the players two days to recover, so if you have one day less it's an issue, a problem. But a top athlete can perform, so my players will be in shape.'' There was better news for midfielder Nigel de Jong, who went through his paces along with the rest of the team in training in a bid to regain his place in Van Gaal's starting XI. De Jong injured his groin early in the second-round victory over Mexico, and there were fears his tournament was over after the Dutch team said he likely would need two to four weeks to recover. But Van Gaal said: "If his reaction is good and he can play, then the miracle can come true." There was further good news for the Netherlands coach on Tuesday, as injury doubts Ron Vlaar and Leroy Fer both trained. Meanwhile, Van Gaal's decision to bring on Tim Krul in the 120th minute of the quarterfinal win against Costa Rica was hailed as a masterstroke. Krul saved two penalties after replacing Jasper Cillessen, but the Newcastle man will not start the semifinal. "No. I ruled that out straight away,'' Van Gaal said when asked whether he would play Krul. "Jasper is doing a wonderful job, it was just that stopping a penalty is something that the others [Krul and third choice Michel Vorm] are better at.'' Although Argentina are yet to hit peak form in Brazil, they are the bookmakers' favourites for the match at the Arena Corinthians. Van Gaal, though, believes there is nothing between the two sides. "I don't think there is a favourite,'' he said. "The countries are at the same level. It's a 50-50 match and we have to be a bit lucky too.'' Key to Netherlands' chances of making the final will be how they deal with the threat posed by Lionel Messi, who has finally transferred his domestic form with Barcelona onto the international stage. "He has been voted the world's best player before, and you don't get that for nothing,'' Van Gaal said. "He has always found it hard to show his form at international level. "He wants to do it at this tournament, and we want to stop him. That will be a challenge.''	sports

Real Madrid duo Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale pay tribute to Alfredo Di Stefano - ESPN FC	Real Madrid captain Iker Casillas and galacticos Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale have continued the tributes to club legend Alfredo Di Stefano, who has died aged 88. - Alvarez: Alfredo Di Stefano: 1926-2014 - Rigg: Di Stefano's lasting legacy in Madrid - Vickery: Di Stefano: South America's greatest Di Stefano passed away in a Madrid hospital on Monday, having suffered a heart attack while celebrating his 88th birthday last weekend. Blancos president Florentino Perez called the Argentine-born former Spain international "the greatest player ever," while leading figures from Spanish, Argentine and world football have also been quick to remember a player who won five European Cups, eight La Liga trophies and two Ballon d'Or awards. Thousands of fans are expected to say a final goodbye to Di Stefano at the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu, where his remains will be on public view all day Tuesday. Madrid players including Casillas will also be present, and the long-serving goalkeeper tweeted his thoughts on hearing the news on Monday evening: "Rest in peace Don Alfredo, the greatest," Casillas said. "Legend of madridismo, with us always. I will always remember you maestro." DEP Don Alfredo, el más grande. Leyenda del madridismo, siempre con nosotros. Siempre le recordaré MAESTRO. pic.twitter.com/qsdlF8TT96 - Iker Casillas (@CasillasWorld) July 7, 2014 Cristiano Ronaldo also used twitter to communicate his sadness on hearing the news.

Such widespread tributes were fitting for a man who had also played for River Plate, Millionarios of Bogota and Espanyol, and coached Elche, Boca Juniors, Valencia, Real Madrid, Sporting Lisbon, Rayo Vallecano, Castellon and River Plate. Alfredo di Stefano (July 4, 1926 - July 7, 2014) • 308 goals in 11 seasons for Real Madrid. • Two-time Ballon d'Or winner (1957, 1959). • Eight La Liga titles, five European Cups with Madrid. • Scored 50 goals in 60 European Cup matches. • 31 international caps for Spain, scoring 23 goals. • Argentina born, he also played six times for the Albiceleste.  • Also played for River Plate, Millionarios (COL). Espanyol (ESP). • Coached eight teams, including Real Madrid and Valencia. • Real Madrid Castilla play at Alfredo di Stefano Stadium. Madrid's rivals Barcelona and Atletico Madrid offered their condolences, as did many leading figures from the world of football including Lionel Messi, Pele, Alex Ferguson, Jose Mourinho, Diego Simeone and Sepp Blatter. Among the tributes is a collection of archive footage compiled by Real Madrid TV which shows Di Stefano through six decades of association with the club, and ends with a moving clip taken from a biopic made in 1956.	sports

Marca's front cover on Tuesday was a simple tribute, while AS showed Di Stefano celebrating a goal as a player with the headline: "Di Stefano -- from Madrid to heaven." #LaPortada con la que rendimos nuestro particular homenaje a Di Stéfano #EternoDiStéfano pic.twitter.com/5JEYD6IhWx - MARCA (@marca) July 7, 2014 In Catalonia there was also an outpouring of support, with Mundo Deportivo bidding 'Goodbye to a Legend'. Such widespread tributes were fitting for a man who had also played for River Plate, Millionarios of Bogota and Espanyol, and coached Elche, Boca Juniors, Valencia, Real Madrid, Sporting Lisbon, Rayo Vallecano, Castellon and River Plate. Alfredo di Stefano (July 4, 1926 - July 7, 2014) • 308 goals in 11 seasons for Real Madrid. • Two-time Ballon d'Or winner (1957, 1959). • Eight La Liga titles, five European Cups with Madrid. • Scored 50 goals in 60 European Cup matches. • 31 international caps for Spain, scoring 23 goals. • Argentina born, he also played six times for the Albiceleste.  • Also played for River Plate, Millionarios (COL). Espanyol (ESP). • Coached eight teams, including Real Madrid and Valencia. • Real Madrid Castilla play at Alfredo di Stefano Stadium. Madrid's rivals Barcelona and Atletico Madrid offered their condolences, as did many leading figures from the world of football including Lionel Messi, Pele, Alex Ferguson, Jose Mourinho, Diego Simeone and Sepp Blatter. Among the tributes is a collection of archive footage compiled by Real Madrid TV which shows Di Stefano through six decades of association with the club, and ends with a moving clip taken from a biopic made in 1956.	sports
Germany defender Mats Hummels has knee injury, status for World Cup final uncertain - ESPN FC	Germany defender Mats Hummels' status for the World Cup final is uncertain as he deals with a knee injury. Hummels came off at halftime of Germany's 7-1 semifinal victory against Brazil on Tuesday, with Die Mannschaft already comfortably ahead 5-0. The centre-back said the problem was not major, but it may be able to keep him out of Sunday's final, when Germany will face the winners of Argentina and the Netherlands. Hummels hurt his left knee in Germany's opening match against Portugal but returned for the next game. Mats Hummels left Germany's win at halftime with a knee injury that could rule him out of the final. He also sat out their round of 16 match against Algeria with the flu, but then scored the only goal in their quarterfinal win over France. "More problems with my knee," Hummels told German radio ARD. "We will find out the exact diagnosis [on Wednesday]. "There won't be a horror diagnosis and there is hope that it works again in five days. I will definitely need intensive treatment. "If I can't train on Saturday I wouldn't go and say I can play on Sunday." Hummels helped set up Germany's fifth goal on Tuesday with a dashing run through the midfield.	sports
Lazar Markovic set for Liverpool medical - ESPN FC	Lazar Markovic is set to have a medical later this week as Liverpool close in on their fourth summer signing. The Reds should secure the 20 million pound deal for the Benfica winger within the next few days, sources have told ESPN FC. Markovic is due on Merseyside to put the finishing touches to the transfer as manager Brendan Rodgers continues to add to his squad with the departure of Luis Suarez pending. The 20-year-old, who moved to Portugal from Partizan Belgrade in June 2013, helped Benfica to last season's Europa League final -- although he missed the defeat against Sevilla in Turin because of suspension. Lazar Markovic scored five goals in 25 games for Benfica last season. Rodgers has brought in three players so far this summer -- England internationals Rickie Lambert and Adam Lallana from Southampton and Germany Under-21 midfielder Emre Can from Bayer Leverkusen -- and is looking to strengthen further. A deal worth an initial fee of six million pounds for Lille's Belgian midfielder Divock Origi is in the pipeline. And Liverpool are also still pursuing moves for Sevilla left-back Alberto Moreno and Southampton centre-back Dejan Lovren, although they are not close to agreeing a fee for either player. Talks over the proposed 75 million pound sale of Uruguay striker Suarez to Barcelona are continuing, with the sticking point believed to be the structuring of payments rather than the fee itself. Rodgers is also looking to sell goalkeeper Pepe Reina -- who spent last season on loan in Serie A at Napoli -- but has had no offers so far.	sports

Blancos president Florentino Perez called the Argentine-born former Spain international "the greatest player ever," while leading figures from Spanish, Argentine and world football have also been quick to remember a player who won five European Cups, eight La Liga trophies and two Ballon d'Or awards. Thousands of fans are expected to say a final goodbye to Di Stefano at the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu, where his remains will be on public view all day Tuesday. Madrid players including Casillas will also be present, and the long-serving goalkeeper tweeted his thoughts on hearing the news on Monday evening: "Rest in peace Don Alfredo, the greatest," Casillas said.

Napoli voice support for Colombia full-back Juan Zuniga - ESPN FC	Napoli have come out in defence of their Colombia full-back Juan Zuniga in response to criticism following Neymar's World Cup-ending injury. The Brazil forward was kneed in the back by Zuniga during the quarterfinal clash on Friday and suffered a fractured vertebra that has ruled him out for the remainder of the tournament. Neymar out of the World Cup - Ex-ref blames FIFA for Neymar injury - FIFA to investigate Neymar injury - Referee Carballo faces criticism - Jones: The morning after the night before - Duarte: The World Cup's crushing loss - World Cup Tonight: How will Brazil cope? - Young: Brazilian media reacts - Uersfeld: German media reaction - Lang: Five players who must step up - Neymar injury dampens celebration Zuniga, who did not receive a card for the challenge, has come under fire for the incident, while the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) had pushed for disciplinary action against the 28-year-old, only to be knocked back by FIFA's disciplinary committee, which said the referee had seen the incident. Napoli issued a statement on Tuesday in support of their player which read: "Napoli are sorry for the accident that occurred that will prevent Neymar from playing in the semifinal against Germany [on Tuesday]. "For the Brazilian champion we send our best wishes for a speedy recovery. Brazil vs. Germany: Tuesday, 4 ET, 9 BST (ESPN and WatchESPN) - Marcotti: Titans collide in the semifinals - Honigstein: Bierhoff's technological focus - Torre: Scolari lightens the mood - Brewin: Battered Brazil vs. vulnerable Germany - Smith: Jogo bonito the exception, not the rule - 50-50 Challenge: Brazil vs. Germany - Duarte: Brazil move past star absences - Cox: Brazil and Germany's role reversal "At the same time, the club expresses its support for Zuniga, who has been subjected to fierce criticism and threats of all kinds, for a foul in play that was not malicious but unfortunate in its consequences. "We note with relief that, in addition to the referee and his assistants, FIFA's disciplinary committee stated that there were no bad intentions on Zuniga's part.'' Neymar is expected to be sidelined for at least four weeks.	sports

Marcotti: A shocking exit for Scolari and Brazil - ESPN FC	BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil -- Eventually, you run out of ideas. At 1-0, the yellow-clad population of the Estadio Mineirao groaned. A bloody nose, yes. But stick some cotton in and suck it up. At 2-0, there was incredulity. A young lady in the stands raised her hand, thumb in, digits extended over her open mouth. 3-0 and 4-0 were one and the same. Two stabs from Toni Kroos in the space of 69 seconds, the fastest brace in the history of the World Cup. Like burning yourself on a hot stove and then stubbing your toe when you jump away in pain. Hurt and more hurt. No time in between to react. But afterward, it was defiance. Chants of "Bra-sil! Bra-sil!" Not lame but full-throated, perhaps as a way of venting anger at the players. At 5-0, folks began to make their way to the exits. Twenty-nine minutes had passed. Read it again. TWENTY-NINE. But people had seen enough. It wasn't a majority, obviously, not even a significant plurality, but enough that you would notice. They filed away silently, looking away from the pitch, a yellow goo oozing toward the stairwells. Halftime was predictable: boos and cat-calls rained down mercilessly and echoed in the cavernous Mineirao. If, prior to kickoff, the ground's acoustics had amplified the Brazilians' sound, now -- after five goals -- it was a roar. At 6-0, the wrath seemed focused on one man. Fred, the mustachioed centre-forward who for the past weeks had flailed in carrying the torch passed on by the legendary Selecao strikers of yesteryear, from Ronaldo and Romario all the way back to Pele and Artur Friedenreich. In truth, the insults, expletives and bile vomited in his direction had begun at the start of the second half, perhaps when the realization he was still on the pitch hit. They rose to a crescendo after Andre Schurrle made it six, and Fred laconically made way for Willian. At 7-0, it was simple. They rose as one and offered up an ovation. Schurrle's goal -- his second -- was pretty, but it wasn't Diego Maradona-against-England-in-1986 pretty. Were they applauding him? The Germans? Were they being sarcastic? Was it all of the above? Or was this merely the last possible reaction they could think of, having exhausted all others? By the time Oscar fixed the final score at 7-1, there had been scuffles in the stands (at least five distinct ones -- all among Brazil fans -- visible from the press tribune). There had also been a period of "oles" at every German touch. Fans do this when they're well ahead, either to celebrate their own side's supremacy or to mock their opponent's futility ("See? They finally strung two passes together."). This was different. It was perhaps as unprecedented as a nation with five stars above its crest losing 7-1 at home in a World Cup semifinal. There is no script for this. It's virgin territory for everyone involved. You don't know how to react. Luiz Felipe Scolari, looking as if he had sailed with Charles Marlowe into the heart of darkness (only, instead of finding Kurtz, he found Kroos), insisted afterward that life goes on. It does. It just won't be the same. "We tried to do what we could, and we did what we thought was best," he said. "But in six or seven minutes, they scored three or four goals [four in six minutes actually, but you wouldn't blame the shell-shocked Scolari for getting it wrong], and they did it in an extraordinary manner. It was one after the other. We tried [from the bench] to talk to them, to get them to stop for a second, but we just could not." In a situation such as this, you wonder if it's even worthwhile talking about tactics. Schemes and formations, after all, often mutate after one goal, usually after two and, well, when you're 5-0 down inside the time it takes to watch a rerun of Glee, there really is no such thing anymore. Scolari was devoid of his best player, Neymar, and his captain and defensive stalwart, Thiago Silva, but to his credit, he didn't use the absences as an excuse. "It would have made no difference," he said. "What was Neymar going to do?" Scolari tried to channel emotions and turn a negative into a neutral or maybe even a positive. David Luiz and Julio Cesar held up the missing talisman's No. 10 jersey, and even the mascots ("player escorts," as FIFA like to call them) sang their little lungs out during a raucous rendition of the Brazilian anthem. Scolari had gone for the jugular, with the same 4-2-3-1 formation he's played throughout the tournament, which many thought he'd abandon against the Germans. Little Bernard, all 5-foot-5 of him, the hometown hero, slotted into the wing, with Oscar shifting inside while Fernandinho and the returning Luiz Gustavo were ready to do battle. There were moments in the first few minutes when it looked like the old-style 4-2-4 Vicente Feola might have used in 1958. But that lasted until the first German goal in the 11th minute, when David Luiz somehow lost Thomas Muller in the penalty box and gifted him the easiest of side-foot finishes from a few yards out. Scolari's dream of winning a second World Cup as Brazil coach ended in humiliating fashion. "Everything was organized, everything was calm until the goal was scored," Scolari said. "Then everything became disorganized, everything was panicked." For his part, Joachim Low offered up the same formation that beat France -- with Phillip Lahm tucked in at right-back -- but with one crucial tweak. When he saw Scolari's lineup, he shifted Sami Khedira from his role alongside Bastian Schweinsteiger in front of the back four to one further forward next to Kroos. 4-2-3-1 became 4-1-4-1 or, if you like your lingo, from triangle up to triangle down. Kroos-Khedira became a two-man gang of outlaws plundering the Brazilian passing lanes and scything their way past the feeble yellow barriers. They prompted the next four goals, including the one that allowed Miroslav Klose to become the all-time leading scorer in World Cup history by passing Ronaldo's mark of 15. "They suddenly were not so well organized, they were hitting long balls, and we took advantage," Low said. "We hit them with fast counterattacks, and we knew that it would cause them problems." The game was over at halftime, except for the record books that would record Schurrle's brace and Oscar's strike. (Don't call it a "consolation goal." Don't you dare.) Afterward, David Luiz apologized in a tearful television interview. Oscar was a fountain of tears too, alternately cuddled by Thiago Silva, himself bawling, and Schurrle, his club teammate. Julio Cesar said that, in place of this, he would much rather have lost 1-0 while making the mistake that cost his team the game. That way, there would only be one scapegoat. Brazil 1-7 Germany -- reaction - Marcotti: Scolari at a loss to explain - Jones: Seven stages of grief for Brazil - Duarte: Haunting defeat for the Selecao - Delaney: Three Points - Brazil broken by Germany - Low: German plan worked perfectly - Behind the Numbers: Germany's historic win - Photo Gallery: Best of Brazil vs. Germany - Klose breaks World Cup goals record | Highlight - Social reaction: Brazil, did that just happen? Instead, there are many. "I am responsible," Scolari said. "I pick the team, I prepare the team. Though if you ask my players, they will also say they're responsible because we are a team and we share victories and defeats. But for me, when I look at my life as a player, a coach, a teacher ... yes, it is the worst day of my life. I will be remembered as the man who lost 7-1 in Brazil in a World Cup semifinal." Low was as magnanimous as he could be, given the circumstances. After all, eight years ago, as Jurgen Klinsmann's assistant, he too saw his team come up short as host nation in a World Cup semifinal. "I know how Scolari feels," he said. "I remember 2006 and losing to Italy and the disappointment of a nation." He was being kind. As gut-wrenching as 2006 might have been to Germany, giving up a goal in the 119th minute of a match is not the same as giving up five within 30 minutes and losing 7-1, after 39 years of avoiding defeat in competitive matches on home soil. Low knows there isn't much you can take from this game, other than the result. His men found themselves in a freakish situation, they kept their heads, and they executed. If he's concerned about his troops being grounded and not getting carried away, he can take solace in the words of Kroos. "For a minute, we had trouble believing we were really 5-0 up," he said. "I mean, when do you ever win a semifinal 7-1?" "But we have one more game to go," he continued. "Nobody has ever become world champion in the semifinals." Those are the words of a young man who knows what he wants and knows how to get -- and they're just what Low wanted to hear. Germany and Brazil entered a Twilight Zone on Tuesday. One nation emerged to find itself 90 minutes from becoming champion of the world. The other has wounds that won't heal for a long time.

Miroslav Klose fittingly pushes past Ronaldo on World Cup goal charts - ESPN FC	BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil -- The center forward might be an endangered species on Germany's national team these days, but as Miroslav Klose showed in Tuesday's 7-1 demolition of Brazil, it's not extinct just yet. Now, after scoring his 16th career World Cup goal, he has a spot in the record books all by himself. No doubt, Germany's shocking World Cup semifinal triumph over the hosts owed itself to numerous factors. The displays of Toni Kroos and Sami Khedira were devastating, although the midfield errors committed by the hosts will be part of the autopsy performed on this edition of the Selecao. Brazil also had no answer for the mobility, passing and scoring of Thomas Muller, reminding everyone that at this point in its history, Germany is blessed with a preponderance of playmakers. Such a development has made Klose, 36, more of a peripheral figure for the Nationalmannschaft these days. His start against Brazil was just his second of the tournament. Yet on a night when he was officially credited with less than 58 minutes of work, it proved to be enough time to inflict his share of the damage. He harassed from the front, at one point forcing Brazil goalkeeper Julio Cesar to clear a ball straight out of bounds. He also linked up well with his teammates in critical moments, like in the 23rd minute when he put home his own rebound to make the score 2-0. On a night that saw Germany pummel the hosts, it seemed appropriate that he pushed a Brazilian into second place on the all-time World Cup scoring list, that being Ronaldo. Of course, you don't set a record like the one Klose just took ownership of without the considerable help of teammates, especially when one considers that every single one of Klose's World Cup goals came from 14 yards or closer. Afterward, Klose made it clear where his focus lies. "For me definitely [the goal] is very big, but I'm one of the team players and I want to win the World Cup with the team, that's the most important thing," he said in the postmatch mixed zone. "At the moment of the goal, I tried to give another assistance to Muller, but I was blocked for a Brazilian player. So I tried to score for myself and fortunately I was successful." On the day Germany dismantled Brazil, Miroslav Klose took away Ronaldo's greatest individual achievement. Given that Germany put seven goals past the beleaguered Cesar, it would be easy to play down the importance of Klose's goal. After all, it's difficult to pin down which tally sucked the most belief out of the hosts. But Germany manager Joachim Low felt that Klose's strike was significant, as it started an avalanche that saw Germany score four times in six minutes. "After 2-0, you realized that [Brazil] were confused," he said at his postmatch news conference. "And they never [regained] their original organization. ... We realized that they were cracking up." It was a goal that also showed where Klose's game is at this point in his career. When he first burst on the scene at the 2002 World Cup, he made his mark as an imperious aerial presence. In that tournament, all five of Klose's goals were scored with his head. But over the years, as the legs have started to go a bit, he's relied more on the clever off-the-ball movement that has always been a part of his game. In this instance, he spotted Muller's diagonal run into the box, as well as Kroos' sublime entry pass. He then timed his run perfectly to latch on to Muller's layoff. While Cesar did well to save Klose's initial effort, the German was there to slot home the rebound for his second goal of this World Cup. It marked the first time Klose had scored a World Cup goal in a match that took place beyond the quarterfinals. Brazil 1-7 Germany -- reaction - Marcotti: Scolari at a loss to explain - Jones: Seven stages of grief for Brazil - Duarte: Haunting defeat for the Selecao - Delaney: Three Points - Brazil broken by Germany - Low: German plan worked perfectly - Behind the Numbers: Germany's historic win - Photo Gallery: Best of Brazil vs. Germany - Klose breaks World Cup goals record | Highlight - Social reaction: Brazil, did that just happen? Afterward, Low insisted it was a mark that the entire team could take pride in. "It really means a lot to all of us," he said. "This is a record that only Muller could one day beat. But it's something really great. It's great for Klose because if you have scored the most goals in history of World Cup it's not just a sensational performance. There's something more. We believe that he really deserves it. At his age he's still playing at highest possible level, and he's still dangerous when it comes to scoring goals." Low is right to mention Muller, of course. In just his second World Cup, the Bayern Munich attacker already has 10 career goals, the same number that Klose had after his first two tournaments. Longevity is a difficult attribute to predict, however, and who knows how long Muller will be able to be so prolific. As for Klose, the record is now his, and it's clear he still has something left to give. Lucas Borges contributed to this report.	sports

Marcotti: A shocking exit for Scolari and Brazil - ESPN FC	BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil -- Eventually, you run out of ideas. At 1-0, the yellow-clad population of the Estadio Mineirao groaned. A bloody nose, yes. But stick some cotton in and suck it up. At 2-0, there was incredulity. A young lady in the stands raised her hand, thumb in, digits extended over her open mouth. 3-0 and 4-0 were one and the same. Two stabs from Toni Kroos in the space of 69 seconds, the fastest brace in the history of the World Cup. Like burning yourself on a hot stove and then stubbing your toe when you jump away in pain. Hurt and more hurt. No time in between to react. But afterward, it was defiance. Chants of "Bra-sil! Bra-sil!" Not lame but full-throated, perhaps as a way of venting anger at the players. At 5-0, folks began to make their way to the exits. Twenty-nine minutes had passed. Read it again. TWENTY-NINE. But people had seen enough. It wasn't a majority, obviously, not even a significant plurality, but enough that you would notice. They filed away silently, looking away from the pitch, a yellow goo oozing toward the stairwells. Halftime was predictable: boos and cat-calls rained down mercilessly and echoed in the cavernous Mineirao. If, prior to kickoff, the ground's acoustics had amplified the Brazilians' sound, now -- after five goals -- it was a roar. At 6-0, the wrath seemed focused on one man. Fred, the mustachioed centre-forward who for the past weeks had flailed in carrying the torch passed on by the legendary Selecao strikers of yesteryear, from Ronaldo and Romario all the way back to Pele and Artur Friedenreich. In truth, the insults, expletives and bile vomited in his direction had begun at the start of the second half, perhaps when the realization he was still on the pitch hit. They rose to a crescendo after Andre Schurrle made it six, and Fred laconically made way for Willian. At 7-0, it was simple. They rose as one and offered up an ovation. Schurrle's goal -- his second -- was pretty, but it wasn't Diego Maradona-against-England-in-1986 pretty. Were they applauding him? The Germans? Were they being sarcastic? Was it all of the above? Or was this merely the last possible reaction they could think of, having exhausted all others? By the time Oscar fixed the final score at 7-1, there had been scuffles in the stands (at least five distinct ones -- all among Brazil fans -- visible from the press tribune). There had also been a period of "oles" at every German touch. Fans do this when they're well ahead, either to celebrate their own side's supremacy or to mock their opponent's futility ("See? They finally strung two passes together."). This was different. It was perhaps as unprecedented as a nation with five stars above its crest losing 7-1 at home in a World Cup semifinal. There is no script for this. It's virgin territory for everyone involved. You don't know how to react. Luiz Felipe Scolari, looking as if he had sailed with Charles Marlowe into the heart of darkness (only, instead of finding Kurtz, he found Kroos), insisted afterward that life goes on. It does. It just won't be the same. "We tried to do what we could, and we did what we thought was best," he said. "But in six or seven minutes, they scored three or four goals [four in six minutes actually, but you wouldn't blame the shell-shocked Scolari for getting it wrong], and they did it in an extraordinary manner. It was one after the other. We tried [from the bench] to talk to them, to get them to stop for a second, but we just could not." In a situation such as this, you wonder if it's even worthwhile talking about tactics. Schemes and formations, after all, often mutate after one goal, usually after two and, well, when you're 5-0 down inside the time it takes to watch a rerun of Glee, there really is no such thing anymore. Scolari was devoid of his best player, Neymar, and his captain and defensive stalwart, Thiago Silva, but to his credit, he didn't use the absences as an excuse. "It would have made no difference," he said. "What was Neymar going to do?" Scolari tried to channel emotions and turn a negative into a neutral or maybe even a positive. David Luiz and Julio Cesar held up the missing talisman's No. 10 jersey, and even the mascots ("player escorts," as FIFA like to call them) sang their little lungs out during a raucous rendition of the Brazilian anthem. Scolari had gone for the jugular, with the same 4-2-3-1 formation he's played throughout the tournament, which many thought he'd abandon against the Germans. Little Bernard, all 5-foot-5 of him, the hometown hero, slotted into the wing, with Oscar shifting inside while Fernandinho and the returning Luiz Gustavo were ready to do battle. There were moments in the first few minutes when it looked like the old-style 4-2-4 Vicente Feola might have used in 1958. But that lasted until the first German goal in the 11th minute, when David Luiz somehow lost Thomas Muller in the penalty box and gifted him the easiest of side-foot finishes from a few yards out. Scolari's dream of winning a second World Cup as Brazil coach ended in humiliating fashion. "Everything was organized, everything was calm until the goal was scored," Scolari said. "Then everything became disorganized, everything was panicked." For his part, Joachim Low offered up the same formation that beat France -- with Phillip Lahm tucked in at right-back -- but with one crucial tweak. When he saw Scolari's lineup, he shifted Sami Khedira from his role alongside Bastian Schweinsteiger in front of the back four to one further forward next to Kroos. 4-2-3-1 became 4-1-4-1 or, if you like your lingo, from triangle up to triangle down. Kroos-Khedira became a two-man gang of outlaws plundering the Brazilian passing lanes and scything their way past the feeble yellow barriers. They prompted the next four goals, including the one that allowed Miroslav Klose to become the all-time leading scorer in World Cup history by passing Ronaldo's mark of 15. "They suddenly were not so well organized, they were hitting long balls, and we took advantage," Low said. "We hit them with fast counterattacks, and we knew that it would cause them problems." The game was over at halftime, except for the record books that would record Schurrle's brace and Oscar's strike. (Don't call it a "consolation goal." Don't you dare.) Afterward, David Luiz apologized in a tearful television interview. Oscar was a fountain of tears too, alternately cuddled by Thiago Silva, himself bawling, and Schurrle, his club teammate. Julio Cesar said that, in place of this, he would much rather have lost 1-0 while making the mistake that cost his team the game. That way, there would only be one scapegoat. Brazil 1-7 Germany -- reaction - Marcotti: Scolari at a loss to explain - Jones: Seven stages of grief for Brazil - Duarte: Haunting defeat for the Selecao - Delaney: Three Points - Brazil broken by Germany - Low: German plan worked perfectly - Behind the Numbers: Germany's historic win - Photo Gallery: Best of Brazil vs. Germany - Klose breaks World Cup goals record | Highlight - Social reaction: Brazil, did that just happen? Instead, there are many. "I am responsible," Scolari said. "I pick the team, I prepare the team. Though if you ask my players, they will also say they're responsible because we are a team and we share victories and defeats. But for me, when I look at my life as a player, a coach, a teacher ... yes, it is the worst day of my life. I will be remembered as the man who lost 7-1 in Brazil in a World Cup semifinal." Low was as magnanimous as he could be, given the circumstances. After all, eight years ago, as Jurgen Klinsmann's assistant, he too saw his team come up short as host nation in a World Cup semifinal. "I know how Scolari feels," he said. "I remember 2006 and losing to Italy and the disappointment of a nation." He was being kind. As gut-wrenching as 2006 might have been to Germany, giving up a goal in the 119th minute of a match is not the same as giving up five within 30 minutes and losing 7-1, after 39 years of avoiding defeat in competitive matches on home soil. Low knows there isn't much you can take from this game, other than the result. His men found themselves in a freakish situation, they kept their heads, and they executed. If he's concerned about his troops being grounded and not getting carried away, he can take solace in the words of Kroos. "For a minute, we had trouble believing we were really 5-0 up," he said. "I mean, when do you ever win a semifinal 7-1?" "But we have one more game to go," he continued. "Nobody has ever become world champion in the semifinals." Those are the words of a young man who knows what he wants and knows how to get -- and they're just what Low wanted to hear. Germany and Brazil entered a Twilight Zone on Tuesday.

A haunting defeat for Brazil - ESPN FC	BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil -- You have got to hand it to the Brazilian players. A few minutes after suffering the worst drubbing in the history of their national team, they did not resort to evasive tactics when it was time to explain what had just happened on the Estadio Mineirao pitch. The problem was none of them seemed to know the answer to the question. One by one, they negotiated the maze called the mixed zone with looks that gave away a feeling many people watching the semifinal against Germany had been able to preempt: This generation of Selecao stars will be forever marked by Tuesday's events in Belo Horizonte. Dani Alves, dropped from the team after the Chile game in the round of 16, led the saddest of parades. "We have lost the game, and that hurts more than anything else," the Barcelona full-back said. "We are out of the final, and that would have been difficult to handle even if we had lost 1-0." There was nowhere to hide from a score that kept flashing on the many monitors spread around the maze. Brazil 1-7 Germany -- reaction - Marcotti: Scolari at a loss to explain - Jones: Seven stages of grief for Brazil - Duarte: Haunting defeat for the Selecao - Delaney: Three Points - Brazil broken by Germany - Low: German plan worked perfectly - Behind the Numbers: Germany's historic win - Photo Gallery: Best of Brazil vs. Germany - Klose breaks World Cup goals record | Highlight - Social reaction: Brazil, did that just happen? Seven goals to one. It is a result that will mark a generation of footballers, supporters and -- why not -- journalists. The fact that Brazil still have a chance to save some face in Saturday's playoff for third place in Brasilia seemed much less a consolation prize than a nuisance for athletes who had just been humiliated on the biggest stage of their careers, in front of their own fans. "We have to take it like men and try to bounce back," Willian said, with his gaze focusing on everything other than his interlocutor's eyes. "We are all family bread-winners and people with feelings. We know this defeat might haunt us for the rest of our lives." Still, Brazil will have to take the field once more, and avoiding another debacle has become a matter of urgency for Luiz Felipe Scolari, who could not have looked more deflated. Gone was his dream of emulating Italy's Vittorio Pozzo as the only manager to win two World Cups, and in the same stride, he might have kissed goodbye to aspirations of a triumphant return to European football to resume a project abruptly aborted when he was dismissed by Chelsea in 2009. As expected, Big Phil attempted to shoulder the blame. "Who is responsible for team selection and tactical choices? I am," he said. "So I am the person who will be remembered for the worst defeat, but we took a risk, and now we have to assimilate and keep living." Scolari, it should be noted, put on the pitch a first XI that had never trained together. Even victory in Saturday's third-place match will do little to shake the memories of Brazil's Belo Horizonte humiliation. Saturday's game will actually be the start of the Selecao's long walk of shame toward the 2018 World Cup. For a start, it will probably be the last time we will see a good number of players in a Brazil shirt. Julio Cesar, who turns 35 in September, all but ruled himself out of future caps -- "maybe the next World Cup is beyond my reach" -- when trying to talk about the future of the team. The defeat was particularly hard on the goalkeeper, not only because of the number of balls in the back of his net but also due to the feeling that his teammates have a lot of work to do to shake off this Mineirazo. "I wish we had lost 1-0, and I had made mistake," he said. "It's very hard what happened today. They simply scored four goals in six minutes, and all of a sudden we were all over the place. We lost our focus, and that was fatal against a team like Germany. These guys have been playing together for six years and contested a series of European Championships and World Cup semifinals. They are experienced and pounced on our mistakes." Oscar, who was propped up by Scolari on the pitch and seemingly admonished by the manager for weeping, was the image of somebody dreading to think about the next few months or years. "I am gutted, it was impossible not to feel like crying after a game like this," the scorer of Brazil's goal said. In an attempt to pick up the pieces, David Luiz, whose first official game as Brazil captain ended with the horrendous sound of home fans booing the Selecao after applauding the Germans' seventh goal, called for calm. "Life is not over," he said. "It's perhaps the hardest moments in our lives, but we need to be mature and own up to our mistakes. We have a chance to leave this World Cup with our heads up". It will be much easier said than done. The drubbing in Belo Horizonte has, ironically, finally turned the Maracanazo, Brazil's famous defeat to Uruguay in the final match of the 1950 World Cup, into a thing of the ancient past. Haunting the Selecao now -- and for the foreseeable future -- is a night in which they were humbled, outclassed and made to look ordinary. It is impossible not to think they are main witnesses to the moment Brazilian football as we know it died a horrible and painful death at the hands of Germany. Bouncing back from that will take a lot more than words and promises.

"I am gutted, it was impossible not to feel like crying after a game like this," the scorer of Brazil's goal said. In an attempt to pick up the pieces, David Luiz, whose first official game as Brazil captain ended with the horrendous sound of home fans booing the Selecao after applauding the Germans' seventh goal, called for calm. "Life is not over," he said. "It's perhaps the hardest moments in our lives, but we need to be mature and own up to our mistakes. We have a chance to leave this World Cup with our heads up". It will be much easier said than done. The drubbing in Belo Horizonte has, ironically, finally turned the Maracanazo, Brazil's famous defeat to Uruguay in the final match of the 1950 World Cup, into a thing of the ancient past. Haunting the Selecao now -- and for the foreseeable future -- is a night in which they were humbled, outclassed and made to look ordinary. It is impossible not to think they are main witnesses to the moment Brazilian football as we know it died a horrible and painful death at the hands of Germany. Bouncing back from that will take a lot more than words and promises.

German media rave over epic World Cup win over Brazil - ESPN FC	Following a historic night in Belo Horizonte, German media raved about the Nationalmannschaft, who recorded the largest World Cup semifinal win ever in beating Brazil 7-1 on Tuesday. "7-1! Low XI ecstatic. Into the final," the football mag kicker headlined. "Unbelievable. Historic. Madness. Germany beats Brazil 7-1 in the World Cup semifinal. In words. Seven to one," the paper wrote in their match report. "What a bizarre football match!" "In a frenzy to Rio," the broadsheet Suddeutche Zeitung headlined their match report. In the player ratings, they praised the Man of the Match, Toni Kroos. "After setting up the first goal, nothing and no one was the same as before. Brazil was no longer Brazil. And Kroos was no longer Kroos. He blended Xavi (from his best days) with Iniesta (from his best days) with Kroos (in his best form). He won balls in defense and hammered them into the danger zone," the paper wrote. "The miracle of Belo Horizonte is legendary already" was Die Welt's take on the match. "Unleashed? Unique? World Cup winning? Germany beat Brazil with a performance which can't even be measured with historic parameters." Die Welt also noted that Miroslav Klose's taking the all-time scoring record from Ronaldo in Brazil -- and surpassing Brazil in the total number of World Cup goals scored -- was "the ultimate humiliation for the hosts."

Miroslav Klose fittingly pushes past Ronaldo on World Cup goal charts - ESPN FC	BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil -- The center forward might be an endangered species on Germany's national team these days, but as Miroslav Klose showed in Tuesday's 7-1 demolition of Brazil, it's not extinct just yet. Now, after scoring his 16th career World Cup goal, he has a spot in the record books all by himself. No doubt, Germany's shocking World Cup semifinal triumph over the hosts owed itself to numerous factors. The displays of Toni Kroos and Sami Khedira were devastating, although the midfield errors committed by the hosts will be part of the autopsy performed on this edition of the Selecao. Brazil also had no answer for the mobility, passing and scoring of Thomas Muller, reminding everyone that at this point in its history, Germany is blessed with a preponderance of playmakers. Such a development has made Klose, 36, more of a peripheral figure for the Nationalmannschaft these days. His start against Brazil was just his second of the tournament. Yet on a night when he was officially credited with less than 58 minutes of work, it proved to be enough time to inflict his share of the damage. He harassed from the front, at one point forcing Brazil goalkeeper Julio Cesar to clear a ball straight out of bounds. He also linked up well with his teammates in critical moments, like in the 23rd minute when he put home his own rebound to make the score 2-0. On a night that saw Germany pummel the hosts, it seemed appropriate that he pushed a Brazilian into second place on the all-time World Cup scoring list, that being Ronaldo. Of course, you don't set a record like the one Klose just took ownership of without the considerable help of teammates, especially when one considers that every single one of Klose's World Cup goals came from 14 yards or closer. Afterward, Klose made it clear where his focus lies. "For me definitely [the goal] is very big, but I'm one of the team players and I want to win the World Cup with the team, that's the most important thing," he said in the postmatch mixed zone. "At the moment of the goal, I tried to give another assistance to Muller, but I was blocked for a Brazilian player. So I tried to score for myself and fortunately I was successful." On the day Germany dismantled Brazil, Miroslav Klose took away Ronaldo's greatest individual achievement. Given that Germany put seven goals past the beleaguered Cesar, it would be easy to play down the importance of Klose's goal. After all, it's difficult to pin down which tally sucked the most belief out of the hosts. But Germany manager Joachim Low felt that Klose's strike was significant, as it started an avalanche that saw Germany score four times in six minutes. "After 2-0, you realized that [Brazil] were confused," he said at his postmatch news conference. "And they never [regained] their original organization. ... We realized that they were cracking up." It was a goal that also showed where Klose's game is at this point in his career. When he first burst on the scene at the 2002 World Cup, he made his mark as an imperious aerial presence. In that tournament, all five of Klose's goals were scored with his head. But over the years, as the legs have started to go a bit, he's relied more on the clever off-the-ball movement that has always been a part of his game. In this instance, he spotted Muller's diagonal run into the box, as well as Kroos' sublime entry pass. He then timed his run perfectly to latch on to Muller's layoff. While Cesar did well to save Klose's initial effort, the German was there to slot home the rebound for his second goal of this World Cup. It marked the first time Klose had scored a World Cup goal in a match that took place beyond the quarterfinals. Brazil 1-7 Germany -- reaction - Marcotti: Scolari at a loss to explain - Jones: Seven stages of grief for Brazil - Duarte: Haunting defeat for the Selecao - Delaney: Three Points - Brazil broken by Germany - Low: German plan worked perfectly - Behind the Numbers: Germany's historic win - Photo Gallery: Best of Brazil vs. Germany - Klose breaks World Cup goals record | Highlight - Social reaction: Brazil, did that just happen? Afterward, Low insisted it was a mark that the entire team could take pride in. "It really means a lot to all of us," he said. "This is a record that only Muller could one day beat. But it's something really great. It's great for Klose because if you have scored the most goals in history of World Cup it's not just a sensational performance. There's something more. We believe that he really deserves it. At his age he's still playing at highest possible level, and he's still dangerous when it comes to scoring goals." Low is right to mention Muller, of course. In just his second World Cup, the Bayern Munich attacker already has 10 career goals, the same number that Klose had after his first two tournaments. Longevity is a difficult attribute to predict, however, and who knows how long Muller will be able to be so prolific. As for Klose, the record is now his, and it's clear he still has something left to give. Lucas Borges contributed to this report.	sports

A haunting defeat for Brazil - ESPN FC	BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil -- You have got to hand it to the Brazilian players. A few minutes after suffering the worst drubbing in the history of their national team, they did not resort to evasive tactics when it was time to explain what had just happened on the Estadio Mineirao pitch. The problem was none of them seemed to know the answer to the question. One by one, they negotiated the maze called the mixed zone with looks that gave away a feeling many people watching the semifinal against Germany had been able to preempt: This generation of Selecao stars will be forever marked by Tuesday's events in Belo Horizonte. Dani Alves, dropped from the team after the Chile game in the round of 16, led the saddest of parades. "We have lost the game, and that hurts more than anything else," the Barcelona full-back said. "We are out of the final, and that would have been difficult to handle even if we had lost 1-0." There was nowhere to hide from a score that kept flashing on the many monitors spread around the maze. Brazil 1-7 Germany -- reaction - Marcotti: Scolari at a loss to explain - Jones: Seven stages of grief for Brazil - Duarte: Haunting defeat for the Selecao - Delaney: Three Points - Brazil broken by Germany - Low: German plan worked perfectly - Behind the Numbers: Germany's historic win - Photo Gallery: Best of Brazil vs. Germany - Klose breaks World Cup goals record | Highlight - Social reaction: Brazil, did that just happen? Seven goals to one. It is a result that will mark a generation of footballers, supporters and -- why not -- journalists. The fact that Brazil still have a chance to save some face in Saturday's playoff for third place in Brasilia seemed much less a consolation prize than a nuisance for athletes who had just been humiliated on the biggest stage of their careers, in front of their own fans. "We have to take it like men and try to bounce back," Willian said, with his gaze focusing on everything other than his interlocutor's eyes. "We are all family bread-winners and people with feelings. We know this defeat might haunt us for the rest of our lives." Still, Brazil will have to take the field once more, and avoiding another debacle has become a matter of urgency for Luiz Felipe Scolari, who could not have looked more deflated. Gone was his dream of emulating Italy's Vittorio Pozzo as the only manager to win two World Cups, and in the same stride, he might have kissed goodbye to aspirations of a triumphant return to European football to resume a project abruptly aborted when he was dismissed by Chelsea in 2009. As expected, Big Phil attempted to shoulder the blame. "Who is responsible for team selection and tactical choices? I am," he said. "So I am the person who will be remembered for the worst defeat, but we took a risk, and now we have to assimilate and keep living." Scolari, it should be noted, put on the pitch a first XI that had never trained together. Even victory in Saturday's third-place match will do little to shake the memories of Brazil's Belo Horizonte humiliation. Saturday's game will actually be the start of the Selecao's long walk of shame toward the 2018 World Cup. For a start, it will probably be the last time we will see a good number of players in a Brazil shirt. Julio Cesar, who turns 35 in September, all but ruled himself out of future caps -- "maybe the next World Cup is beyond my reach" -- when trying to talk about the future of the team. The defeat was particularly hard on the goalkeeper, not only because of the number of balls in the back of his net but also due to the feeling that his teammates have a lot of work to do to shake off this Mineirazo. "I wish we had lost 1-0, and I had made mistake," he said. "It's very hard what happened today. They simply scored four goals in six minutes, and all of a sudden we were all over the place. We lost our focus, and that was fatal against a team like Germany. These guys have been playing together for six years and contested a series of European Championships and World Cup semifinals. They are experienced and pounced on our mistakes." Oscar, who was propped up by Scolari on the pitch and seemingly admonished by the manager for weeping, was the image of somebody dreading to think about the next few months or years. "I am gutted, it was impossible not to feel like crying after a game like this," the scorer of Brazil's goal said. In an attempt to pick up the pieces, David Luiz, whose first official game as Brazil captain ended with the horrendous sound of home fans booing the Selecao after applauding the Germans' seventh goal, called for calm. "Life is not over," he said. "It's perhaps the hardest moments in our lives, but we need to be mature and own up to our mistakes. We have a chance to leave this World Cup with our heads up". It will be much easier said than done. The drubbing in Belo Horizonte has, ironically, finally turned the Maracanazo, Brazil's famous defeat to Uruguay in the final match of the 1950 World Cup, into a thing of the ancient past.

Three points - History made as Brazil broken by rampant Germany - ESPN FC	BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil -- Three thoughts on a record-breaking night as Brazil were humiliated by a rampant Germany side on the march towards the World Cup final.  1. An eternal embarrassment After so many goals, there was only one description: Minerazo. This was not as painfully dramatic as the 1950 loss to Uruguay -- forever remembered as the Maracanazo -- but that was only because it was possibly worse: It was so humiliatingly excruciating. The details of Germany's 7-1 win -- and the sheer numbers alone are searing -- remain difficult to register. It revealed so much that the first boos were not heard until the 44th minute, long after the fifth goal had been scored. It was as if that was how long it took for the utter shock to wear off, to realise just how bad this was. The dimensions to this defeat were as plentiful as Germany's goals. Given the history, the context, the politics, this may well be the most stunning World Cup match of all time. It is extremely difficult to think of a result or event that compares in football history as a whole. After a World Cup that Brazil had waited two generations for, they have now suffered a defeat that will take generations to forget. The circumstances are almost cruel. The scale of the defeat certainly was. The competition Brazil have dominated and won more than any other country has also left them with their two most painful defeats. They are of the type of defeats that very few victories can erode, that almost nothing can rectify. Brazil now has so much to consider. On their team bus for the World Cup, the message read: "Brace Yourself -- The Sixth is Coming." That took on dark tones. The game itself took on a scarcely believable gloom. There was no sixth trophy. There was only a 7-1 defeat. Read it. It remains shocking. Brazil will never want to look at it again. 2. Brazil was finally found out As stunning as this event was, the elements were not that surprising. The signs were there. As their campaign went on, it did not seem as if they were building up to anything special. Instead, it felt like they were just about keeping it together, that they were set to crumble. In virtually all of their games, they came perilously close to the edge. Chile were inches away from knocking them out, while a frantic physicality was needed to eliminate Colombia. The very fact it came to that in the quarterfinal, however, revealed so much about this team. They never had the quality to win this World Cup. By the end, too, the loss of their single world-class attacker in Neymar felt irrelevant. He couldn't have prevented this. There was always the danger of it happening, that they would unravel against a better side. Yet it's still difficult not to think the hysterical reaction fed into the historic nature of this humiliation. The frenzy the entire country worked itself into saw the equal but opposite reaction on this pitch. Once the deeper problems were exposed, it all gave way. Brazil are not this bad. They are not 7-1 bad. This was about something else. This semifinal as an event was certainly something else. 3. Germany's champion credentials Then there was Germany. What a statement. The story is all about Brazil's collapse, but they were the driving force -- in so many ways. It was not just about the implosion of the hosts. Germany imposed that upon them. Sure, Brazil's awful defensive problems were the direct cause of that tone-setting first goal, as Thomas Muller plundered the ball into the net from close in. Thereafter, though, the Germans brutally expanded the gap between the sides. You only had to look at the interchange for the fourth goal, the emphatic finishes of the third and seventh, as Toni Kroos hammered in one and Andre Schurrle powered in the next. Before all that, there was Miroslav Klose's second. What a situation in which to break a legendary Brazilian's record. Ronaldo was forced to congratulate the forward for his 16th goal on national television, adding insult to injury. The only question is whether such a ridiculously handsome win is actually healthy for Germany, whether they could have benefited from a bigger challenge, whether this will blunt them. After a semifinal against the most successful nation in World Cup history, that seems an astonishing thing to say. This was just an astonishing event.

Brazil's 7 stages of grief against Germany in the World Cup - ESPN FC	SAO PAULO -- The fireworks, blasts like cannons, were going off hours before the game. Not very many went off after. Anticipation had given way to humiliation, and by now this giant city seems to have accepted it. Brazil's historic defeat by the Germans might have been just bad enough to save us. There have been fears, spoken of surprisingly often and openly, about what terrible things would happen if Brazil failed to win this World Cup -- something seen by some here almost as a divine right, a function of pure destiny. Mostly, people had talked about how sideways the world might go if the hosts lost to the hated Argentines in the final. Then every clamp and governor that had been thrown onto this crackling country -- most of the pre-tournament anger having subsided once the games began -- would be released. In the absence of any reason for unity, a potentially violent division would return. It turns out a more decisive cataclysm was coming. Tens of thousands, fenced in by police and metal barricades, packed into the FIFA Fan Fest in Sao Paulo's downtown core before Tuesday night's game. There were concerts and banners and sloshing cups of beer, the familiar motions of celebration, but in truth it was already a kind of limited buoyancy. With Neymar's injury and Thiago Silva's suspension, local hopes had been muted. But they were still there, if under the surface. The anthem wasn't sung so much as it was shouted, and then the whistle blew. Brazil 1-7 Germany -- reaction - Marcotti: Scolari at a loss to explain - Jones: Seven stages of grief for Brazil - Duarte: Haunting defeat for the Selecao - Delaney: Three Points - Brazil broken by Germany - Low: German plan worked perfectly - Behind the Numbers: Germany's historic win - Photo Gallery: Best of Brazil vs. Germany - Klose breaks World Cup goals record | Highlight - Social reaction: Brazil, did that just happen? Then the Germans did what they did -- and so quickly -- with each of their seven goals serving as another of the makeshift stages of accelerated Brazilian grief. The first was met with anxiety, the second with anger, the third with disappointment, the fourth with disbelief. Then came bemusement, surprisingly enough -- some percentage of the thinning crowd that remained actually began cheering for the Germans -- and then understanding and finally acceptance. If there were still a bomb set to go off, the late Brazilian goal, that slim measure of pride, cut the last wire. By then, though, there was no longer any sense of real danger here, no feeling that riots were about to kick off. There were too many police, for starters, but more importantly, there wasn't really anything for the crowd to be angry about. This was a brutal defeat, but it contained no injustice or heartbreak. Brazil -- this Brazil -- just weren't good enough to win the World Cup, even given the advantages of home. They had barely beaten Chile, and they had struggled to hold on against the Colombians. Brazilians had remained hopeful their boys would continue to win, but it felt more and more as though they had stopped believing they would. After they had been made doubtless, they left and went home, or they stumbled into bars in search of one last commiserating drink. Some even thought to blow their air horns, almost ironic screams of defiance against the dark. Maybe the coming days will turn ugly, and fears will come true. Maybe this country will feel the way any of us does when houseguests linger too long. Maybe, for the first time in its history, Brazil will want the party to be over. But right now it doesn't feel that way. It doesn't feel like much of anything. Right now Sao Paulo feels like any other city in the world, except bigger, lit up, buzzing and perhaps even relieved to have joined the World Cup's ever expanding ranks of the abruptly detached.	sports

They are not 7-1 bad. This was about something else. This semifinal as an event was certainly something else. 3. Germany's champion credentials Then there was Germany. What a statement. The story is all about Brazil's collapse, but they were the driving force -- in so many ways. It was not just about the implosion of the hosts. Germany imposed that upon them. Sure, Brazil's awful defensive problems were the direct cause of that tone-setting first goal, as Thomas Muller plundered the ball into the net from close in. Thereafter, though, the Germans brutally expanded the gap between the sides. You only had to look at the interchange for the fourth goal, the emphatic finishes of the third and seventh, as Toni Kroos hammered in one and Andre Schurrle powered in the next. Before all that, there was Miroslav Klose's second. What a situation in which to break a legendary Brazilian's record. Ronaldo was forced to congratulate the forward for his 16th goal on national television, adding insult to injury. The only question is whether such a ridiculously handsome win is actually healthy for Germany, whether they could have benefited from a bigger challenge, whether this will blunt them. After a semifinal against the most successful nation in World Cup history, that seems an astonishing thing to say. This was just an astonishing event.

Brazil's 7 stages of grief against Germany in the World Cup - ESPN FC	SAO PAULO -- The fireworks, blasts like cannons, were going off hours before the game. Not very many went off after. Anticipation had given way to humiliation, and by now this giant city seems to have accepted it. Brazil's historic defeat by the Germans might have been just bad enough to save us. There have been fears, spoken of surprisingly often and openly, about what terrible things would happen if Brazil failed to win this World Cup -- something seen by some here almost as a divine right, a function of pure destiny. Mostly, people had talked about how sideways the world might go if the hosts lost to the hated Argentines in the final. Then every clamp and governor that had been thrown onto this crackling country -- most of the pre-tournament anger having subsided once the games began -- would be released. In the absence of any reason for unity, a potentially violent division would return. It turns out a more decisive cataclysm was coming. Tens of thousands, fenced in by police and metal barricades, packed into the FIFA Fan Fest in Sao Paulo's downtown core before Tuesday night's game. There were concerts and banners and sloshing cups of beer, the familiar motions of celebration, but in truth it was already a kind of limited buoyancy. With Neymar's injury and Thiago Silva's suspension, local hopes had been muted. But they were still there, if under the surface. The anthem wasn't sung so much as it was shouted, and then the whistle blew. Brazil 1-7 Germany -- reaction - Marcotti: Scolari at a loss to explain - Jones: Seven stages of grief for Brazil - Duarte: Haunting defeat for the Selecao - Delaney: Three Points - Brazil broken by Germany - Low: German plan worked perfectly - Behind the Numbers: Germany's historic win - Photo Gallery: Best of Brazil vs. Germany - Klose breaks World Cup goals record | Highlight - Social reaction: Brazil, did that just happen? Then the Germans did what they did -- and so quickly -- with each of their seven goals serving as another of the makeshift stages of accelerated Brazilian grief. The first was met with anxiety, the second with anger, the third with disappointment, the fourth with disbelief. Then came bemusement, surprisingly enough -- some percentage of the thinning crowd that remained actually began cheering for the Germans -- and then understanding and finally acceptance. If there were still a bomb set to go off, the late Brazilian goal, that slim measure of pride, cut the last wire. By then, though, there was no longer any sense of real danger here, no feeling that riots were about to kick off. There were too many police, for starters, but more importantly, there wasn't really anything for the crowd to be angry about. This was a brutal defeat, but it contained no injustice or heartbreak. Brazil -- this Brazil -- just weren't good enough to win the World Cup, even given the advantages of home. They had barely beaten Chile, and they had struggled to hold on against the Colombians. Brazilians had remained hopeful their boys would continue to win, but it felt more and more as though they had stopped believing they would. After they had been made doubtless, they left and went home, or they stumbled into bars in search of one last commiserating drink. Some even thought to blow their air horns, almost ironic screams of defiance against the dark. Maybe the coming days will turn ugly, and fears will come true. Maybe this country will feel the way any of us does when houseguests linger too long. Maybe, for the first time in its history, Brazil will want the party to be over. But right now it doesn't feel that way. It doesn't feel like much of anything. Right now Sao Paulo feels like any other city in the world, except bigger, lit up, buzzing and perhaps even relieved to have joined the World Cup's ever expanding ranks of the abruptly detached.	sports
Dutch on verge of eclipsing forebears - ESPN FC	SAO PAULO -- Sundown, Soccer City, Soweto, July 10, 2010. Dutch players complete the last training session before they take the stage for their nation's third World Cup final. Wesley Sneijder is at shooting practice as Dirk Kuyt and Mark van Bommel serve as a surrogate crowd, cheering and booing successful and unsuccessful attempts. They are a tactile bunch. Many an embrace is exchanged. They look to be enjoying each other's company. "They have to be themselves and have to have the courage to play football against Spain," says coach Bert van Marwijk in the news conference that follows. "I'm not going to tell you how I'm going to play. We just have to be ourselves." Fast-forward 28 hours and Van Marwijk's team were vilified for their role in perhaps the World Cup's most shameful final. That previously jolly bunch became cloggers, responsible for dragging South Africa's showpiece down. Spain's players acted up. During the first half, their play-acting was almost as putrefying, but the act of violence committed by Nigel de Jong, who unleashed a chest-high karate kick on Xabi Alonso, was the flashpoint. "Having seen it again from my armchair, I would red-card him," English referee Howard Webb later admitted. De Jong acquired a deeper pariah status than Johnny Heitinga, later sent off for two very bookable offences. Perhaps if Webb had enjoyed a better view of the incident -- he was unsighted behind Alonso -- then the Dutch players might have become "10 lions and one stupid boy," to borrow the Daily Mirror headline that heralded England's players and targeted David Beckham at France '98. The team that lost 2010's final will never be remembered as fondly as those who fell at the last hurdles of 1974 and 1978 -- Johan Cruyff's Brilliant Oranje, and then Rob Rensenbrink's shot against the post in the belly of the Argentine beast in Buenos Aires. Netherlands vs. Argentina: July 9, 4 ET (ESPN and WatchESPN) - Stats: Diego Maradona vs. Lionel Messi - McIntyre: Superstars collide in Messi vs. Robben - Brewin: Van Gaal's management style - Brassell: Semifinalists have much to lose - Honigstein: Kuyt an unsung hero for the Dutch - Cox: Key semifinal matchups - Marcotti: Then there were four at the World Cup - Five Aside: Dutch, Argentina look to overcome past Netherlands managers work with public expectation of playing open, creative football in the tradition of Cruyff, although that forgets that his generation was no stranger to the dark arts. At the 1976 European championship, the Dutch exited from the semifinals to Czechoslovakia when both Johan Neeskens and Wim van Hanegem were dismissed, and Cruyff received, for dissent, the yellow card that would keep him from the final. Even before Soccer City, Van Marwijk faced criticism of his chosen style of play. The use of Van Bommel and De Jong as a double pivot was a constant source of tension with the straight-talking Dutch press corps, even after a thrilling semifinal victory over Uruguay. Van Marwijk's reputation never recovered. In February 2012, after his team had beaten England 3-2 at Wembley, he got into a lengthy, heated news conference discussion with a Dutch journalist. "I don't want to translate it all, but he thinks Holland should play better and he doesn't agree," explained the interpreter. Euro 2012 was disastrous, and ended with the infighting that usually accompanies Dutch failure. Van Bommel and De Jong's partnership was again criticised as their team bombed in Ukraine. In Brazil, Louis van Gaal had to bear similar criticism for beating Chile by soaking up a significant deficit in possession and scoring two goals on the break. Van Gaal is even more combative than his predecessor, but there is a sense that the Dutch media are much more impressed with this outfit than in 2010. Going so far in South America was not expected, even if the Dutch did reach that final in 1978. Nigel de Jong has transitioned from villain to a central figure in Louis van Gaal's Dutch side. A flurry of goals in the group stage, especially in destroying their 2010 conquerors, has bought Van Gaal admiration. The main players are the same, but Arjen Robben is now the most important. Robben looked like being remembered for missing two chances in 2010's final but he arrived in Sao Paulo as perhaps the outstanding remaining player in the tournament, with only Lionel Messi in his way. "Look how important he is to us with his threat," Stefan de Vrij -- one of the generation of Dutch-based defenders with whom Van Gaal has replaced Van Marwijk's functional and experienced back line -- said about Robben. Van Marwijk usually stuck to a rigid four, but now Van Gaal has switched formations throughout, including using Kuyt as a very effective wing-back. "I'm a coach who likes to work with an established system," Van Marwijk said a month ago while expressing worries about Van Gaal's switches to 5-3-2. Van Gaal has proved himself to be exactly the opposite, while the bravery of his switches -- the introduction of Tim Krul against Costa Rica, in particular -- has masked flat spots like those against Australia, Mexico and in the weekend's quarterfinal. De Jong has been resurrected as a key man, a lone holder to please the Dutch aesthetic, and there was much hope on Tuesday that he could return from his thigh injury. What would seem a less able squad than 2010's, with considerably less experience, has reached the edge of matching, and maybe even surpassing, their fated forebears.	sports

Three points - History made as Brazil broken by rampant Germany - ESPN FC	BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil -- Three thoughts on a record-breaking night as Brazil were humiliated by a rampant Germany side on the march towards the World Cup final.  1. An eternal embarrassment After so many goals, there was only one description: Minerazo. This was not as painfully dramatic as the 1950 loss to Uruguay -- forever remembered as the Maracanazo -- but that was only because it was possibly worse: It was so humiliatingly excruciating. The details of Germany's 7-1 win -- and the sheer numbers alone are searing -- remain difficult to register. It revealed so much that the first boos were not heard until the 44th minute, long after the fifth goal had been scored. It was as if that was how long it took for the utter shock to wear off, to realise just how bad this was. The dimensions to this defeat were as plentiful as Germany's goals. Given the history, the context, the politics, this may well be the most stunning World Cup match of all time. It is extremely difficult to think of a result or event that compares in football history as a whole. After a World Cup that Brazil had waited two generations for, they have now suffered a defeat that will take generations to forget. The circumstances are almost cruel. The scale of the defeat certainly was. The competition Brazil have dominated and won more than any other country has also left them with their two most painful defeats. They are of the type of defeats that very few victories can erode, that almost nothing can rectify. Brazil now has so much to consider. On their team bus for the World Cup, the message read: "Brace Yourself -- The Sixth is Coming." That took on dark tones. The game itself took on a scarcely believable gloom. There was no sixth trophy. There was only a 7-1 defeat. Read it. It remains shocking. Brazil will never want to look at it again. 2. Brazil was finally found out As stunning as this event was, the elements were not that surprising. The signs were there. As their campaign went on, it did not seem as if they were building up to anything special. Instead, it felt like they were just about keeping it together, that they were set to crumble. In virtually all of their games, they came perilously close to the edge. Chile were inches away from knocking them out, while a frantic physicality was needed to eliminate Colombia. The very fact it came to that in the quarterfinal, however, revealed so much about this team. They never had the quality to win this World Cup. By the end, too, the loss of their single world-class attacker in Neymar felt irrelevant. He couldn't have prevented this. There was always the danger of it happening, that they would unravel against a better side. Yet it's still difficult not to think the hysterical reaction fed into the historic nature of this humiliation. The frenzy the entire country worked itself into saw the equal but opposite reaction on this pitch. Once the deeper problems were exposed, it all gave way. Brazil are not this bad. They are not 7-1 bad. This was about something else. This semifinal as an event was certainly something else. 3. Germany's champion credentials Then there was Germany. What a statement. The story is all about Brazil's collapse, but they were the driving force -- in so many ways. It was not just about the implosion of the hosts. Germany imposed that upon them. Sure, Brazil's awful defensive problems were the direct cause of that tone-setting first goal, as Thomas Muller plundered the ball into the net from close in. Thereafter, though, the Germans brutally expanded the gap between the sides. You only had to look at the interchange for the fourth goal, the emphatic finishes of the third and seventh, as Toni Kroos hammered in one and Andre Schurrle powered in the next. Before all that, there was Miroslav Klose's second. What a situation in which to break a legendary Brazilian's record. Ronaldo was forced to congratulate the forward for his 16th goal on national television, adding insult to injury. The only question is whether such a ridiculously handsome win is actually healthy for Germany, whether they could have benefited from a bigger challenge, whether this will blunt them.

Epic rivals reunite in Sao Paulo - ESPN FC	Having settled it like no one else could, Dennis Bergkamp summed it up like no one else could. "You're in that moment," the former Netherlands No. 10 told UK Magazine The Blizzard. "That moment", of course, was the goal; his historic and hysterically excellent strike in the Netherlands' 2-1 victory over Argentina in the 1998 World Cup quarterfinals. "That's the feeling," Bergkamp enthused. "After the first two touches, that moment! You give absolutely everything. It's like your life has led up this moment. "You never play the perfect game. But the moment itself was, I think, perfect." It's certainly difficult to dispute. Consider the dimensions, and not just of Frank De Boer's supremely flighted long-range diagonal pass to find Bergkamp in the first place. That came in the last minute of a match in which both sides were dramatically reduced to 10 men but all had given 100 percent. Somehow, Bergkamp still had more to offer. Dennis Bergkamp's spectacular winner against Argentina is still one of the greatest goals ever in the World Cup. He provided a finesse that transcended such figures, that went beyond normal descriptions. It went beyond normal talent. Sprinting at almost full pace, the forward still had the awareness and precision to kill the ball with one touch, take Roberto Ayala completely out of the picture with the next, and then deliver the deftest of finishes. The economy of touch and space were the inverse of the outlandish excellence. Rarely has one moment seen such a maximisation of talent in such minimalist circumstances. Rarely has one action so defined and reflected a single player's entire career. Rarely has such a high-profile and brilliant match seen such an appropriate crescendo. Speaking on the eve of the latest rematch between the Netherlands and Argentina, on the even more elevated World Cup stage of the semifinals, Javier Mascherano recalled his emotions. The midfielder, who was 14 at the time, can remember exactly where he was, but then few could forget it. "I was at home watching it on television and I was just as disappointed as everyone else." Well, every one else who was Argentinean, that is. The rest of the football-watching world couldn't help but be uplifted, even elated. It has also been something of a theme of this fixture. If Bergkamp is right and there is no "perfect game", these two countries possibly provide the perfect knockout pairing. Getting Ready For Argentina vs. Netherlands: - McIntyre: Argentina's defense rising to occasion - Delaney: Old foes reunite in Argentina vs. Netherlands - McIntyre: Superstars collide in Messi vs. Robben - Cox: Four teams, four key battles - Marcotti: Previewing the World Cup semifinals - World Cup Power Rankings: Germany on top - Ames: Gamesmanship alive and well Although the rivalries of Argentina-England and Italy-Germany can stand alongside it, very few other fixtures have fostered such a concentration of quality and combination of so many different dramatic elements over the span of so many years. Even their first match, a 4-0 Dutch win in the 1974 second group stage, heralded the full rise of Rinus Michels' Total Football team. Since then, two knockout matches -- the 1978 final (an 3-1 win for Argentina) and 1998 quarterfinal -- have raised the pulse. Those games saw relentless action, attacking football, star players making defining statements, so many individual moments of brilliance, historic teams coming together, and awful lot of controversy, and barely believable climaxes. It says so much that both of those games came down to the final minute and the tightest of margins. The 1978 final, in Argentina's capital Buenos Aires, was played under the most oppressive of circumstances. Given the political situation in Argentina at the time, it almost seems trivial to discuss a football match in that context, but the influence of the military regime undeniably conditioned some of this match. The Argentine squad were themselves under huge pressure, but also subjected Italian referee Segio Gonella to some. The home squad complained about a arm cast bandage worn by Rene van der Kerkhof, which led to immediate reactions from the Dutch and threats to walk off. The situation was eventually resolved, but the game kicked off late and led to an atmosphere that the Netherlands camp later described as "boiling." That could be seen all too quickly, as brutal tackles began to fly in. The tournament's outstanding player, Mario Kempes, still kept his cool as hit his fifth goal of the World Cup to give Argentina a 1-0 lead in the 38th minute before Dirk Nanninga hit an equaliser at the 82nd minute. Kempes would then hit the effective winner 15 minutes into extra-time, before Daniel Bertoni rounded things off. Mario Kempes scored the game-deciding goal for Argentina in the 1978 final against the Netherlands. The ticker-tape fell at the Estadio Monumental and the World Cup had one of its most evocative sights, but it could have all gone so differently. After Nanninga's leveler, at the 90th minute, his teammate Rob Rensenbrink was presented with the chance for the winner. It rolled against the post. "If the trajectory of my shot had been five centimetres different, we would have been world champions," Rensenbrink himself told David Winner for the book "Brilliant Orange" years later. "On top of that, I would have been crowned top scorer and perhaps chosen as the best player of the tournament -- all in the same match. That's why I keep things in perspective." Bergkamp certainly displayed perspective 20 years later, as that quarterfinal worked out so differently. It could also have gone in a rather different direction, as the Netherlands' 2-1 victory remains one of the great World Cup games of the modern era. It was not just its unpredictable and immensely entertaining pattern. It was the high tempo and quality at which it was all played out. Wim Jonk set a certain standard with a brilliant snap-shot early on. It may have hit the post, but the bar was raised. Bergkamp himself then foreshadowed what was to come with a gorgeous cushioned header to set up Patrick Kluivert's sharp opening goal, before Claudio Lopez then played poker with Edwin van der Sar before finishing just as excellently. From there, the game flowed, multiple chances were created, two players were sent off. Arthur Numan received a second booking, Ariel Ortega was red-carded for headbutting van der Sar. The game still hadn't reached true boiling point. Bergkamp would raise the temperature. This is what the match in Sao Paulo has to live up to. At least the fixture has perfect form.

Even their first match, a 4-0 Dutch win in the 1974 second group stage, heralded the full rise of Rinus Michels' Total Football team. Since then, two knockout matches -- the 1978 final (an 3-1 win for Argentina) and 1998 quarterfinal -- have raised the pulse. Those games saw relentless action, attacking football, star players making defining statements, so many individual moments of brilliance, historic teams coming together, and awful lot of controversy, and barely believable climaxes. It says so much that both of those games came down to the final minute and the tightest of margins. The 1978 final, in Argentina's capital Buenos Aires, was played under the most oppressive of circumstances. Given the political situation in Argentina at the time, it almost seems trivial to discuss a football match in that context, but the influence of the military regime undeniably conditioned some of this match. The Argentine squad were themselves under huge pressure, but also subjected Italian referee Segio Gonella to some. The home squad complained about a arm cast bandage worn by Rene van der Kerkhof, which led to immediate reactions from the Dutch and threats to walk off. The situation was eventually resolved, but the game kicked off late and led to an atmosphere that the Netherlands camp later described as "boiling." That could be seen all too quickly, as brutal tackles began to fly in. The tournament's outstanding player, Mario Kempes, still kept his cool as hit his fifth goal of the World Cup to give Argentina a 1-0 lead in the 38th minute before Dirk Nanninga hit an equaliser at the 82nd minute. Kempes would then hit the effective winner 15 minutes into extra-time, before Daniel Bertoni rounded things off. Mario Kempes scored the game-deciding goal for Argentina in the 1978 final against the Netherlands. The ticker-tape fell at the Estadio Monumental and the World Cup had one of its most evocative sights, but it could have all gone so differently. After Nanninga's leveler, at the 90th minute, his teammate Rob Rensenbrink was presented with the chance for the winner. It rolled against the post. "If the trajectory of my shot had been five centimetres different, we would have been world champions," Rensenbrink himself told David Winner for the book "Brilliant Orange" years later. "On top of that, I would have been crowned top scorer and perhaps chosen as the best player of the tournament -- all in the same match. That's why I keep things in perspective." Bergkamp certainly displayed perspective 20 years later, as that quarterfinal worked out so differently. It could also have gone in a rather different direction, as the Netherlands' 2-1 victory remains one of the great World Cup games of the modern era. It was not just its unpredictable and immensely entertaining pattern. It was the high tempo and quality at which it was all played out. Wim Jonk set a certain standard with a brilliant snap-shot early on. It may have hit the post, but the bar was raised. Bergkamp himself then foreshadowed what was to come with a gorgeous cushioned header to set up Patrick Kluivert's sharp opening goal, before Claudio Lopez then played poker with Edwin van der Sar before finishing just as excellently. From there, the game flowed, multiple chances were created, two players were sent off. Arthur Numan received a second booking, Ariel Ortega was red-carded for headbutting van der Sar. The game still hadn't reached true boiling point. Bergkamp would raise the temperature. This is what the match in Sao Paulo has to live up to. At least the fixture has perfect form.

Dutch on verge of eclipsing forebears - ESPN FC	SAO PAULO -- Sundown, Soccer City, Soweto, July 10, 2010. Dutch players complete the last training session before they take the stage for their nation's third World Cup final. Wesley Sneijder is at shooting practice as Dirk Kuyt and Mark van Bommel serve as a surrogate crowd, cheering and booing successful and unsuccessful attempts. They are a tactile bunch. Many an embrace is exchanged. They look to be enjoying each other's company. "They have to be themselves and have to have the courage to play football against Spain," says coach Bert van Marwijk in the news conference that follows. "I'm not going to tell you how I'm going to play. We just have to be ourselves." Fast-forward 28 hours and Van Marwijk's team were vilified for their role in perhaps the World Cup's most shameful final. That previously jolly bunch became cloggers, responsible for dragging South Africa's showpiece down. Spain's players acted up. During the first half, their play-acting was almost as putrefying, but the act of violence committed by Nigel de Jong, who unleashed a chest-high karate kick on Xabi Alonso, was the flashpoint. "Having seen it again from my armchair, I would red-card him," English referee Howard Webb later admitted. De Jong acquired a deeper pariah status than Johnny Heitinga, later sent off for two very bookable offences. Perhaps if Webb had enjoyed a better view of the incident -- he was unsighted behind Alonso -- then the Dutch players might have become "10 lions and one stupid boy," to borrow the Daily Mirror headline that heralded England's players and targeted David Beckham at France '98. The team that lost 2010's final will never be remembered as fondly as those who fell at the last hurdles of 1974 and 1978 -- Johan Cruyff's Brilliant Oranje, and then Rob Rensenbrink's shot against the post in the belly of the Argentine beast in Buenos Aires. Netherlands vs. Argentina: July 9, 4 ET (ESPN and WatchESPN) - Stats: Diego Maradona vs. Lionel Messi - McIntyre: Superstars collide in Messi vs. Robben - Brewin: Van Gaal's management style - Brassell: Semifinalists have much to lose - Honigstein: Kuyt an unsung hero for the Dutch - Cox: Key semifinal matchups - Marcotti: Then there were four at the World Cup - Five Aside: Dutch, Argentina look to overcome past Netherlands managers work with public expectation of playing open, creative football in the tradition of Cruyff, although that forgets that his generation was no stranger to the dark arts. At the 1976 European championship, the Dutch exited from the semifinals to Czechoslovakia when both Johan Neeskens and Wim van Hanegem were dismissed, and Cruyff received, for dissent, the yellow card that would keep him from the final. Even before Soccer City, Van Marwijk faced criticism of his chosen style of play. The use of Van Bommel and De Jong as a double pivot was a constant source of tension with the straight-talking Dutch press corps, even after a thrilling semifinal victory over Uruguay. Van Marwijk's reputation never recovered. In February 2012, after his team had beaten England 3-2 at Wembley, he got into a lengthy, heated news conference discussion with a Dutch journalist. "I don't want to translate it all, but he thinks Holland should play better and he doesn't agree," explained the interpreter. Euro 2012 was disastrous, and ended with the infighting that usually accompanies Dutch failure. Van Bommel and De Jong's partnership was again criticised as their team bombed in Ukraine. In Brazil, Louis van Gaal had to bear similar criticism for beating Chile by soaking up a significant deficit in possession and scoring two goals on the break. Van Gaal is even more combative than his predecessor, but there is a sense that the Dutch media are much more impressed with this outfit than in 2010. Going so far in South America was not expected, even if the Dutch did reach that final in 1978. Nigel de Jong has transitioned from villain to a central figure in Louis van Gaal's Dutch side. A flurry of goals in the group stage, especially in destroying their 2010 conquerors, has bought Van Gaal admiration. The main players are the same, but Arjen Robben is now the most important. Robben looked like being remembered for missing two chances in 2010's final but he arrived in Sao Paulo as perhaps the outstanding remaining player in the tournament, with only Lionel Messi in his way. "Look how important he is to us with his threat," Stefan de Vrij -- one of the generation of Dutch-based defenders with whom Van Gaal has replaced Van Marwijk's functional and experienced back line -- said about Robben. Van Marwijk usually stuck to a rigid four, but now Van Gaal has switched formations throughout, including using Kuyt as a very effective wing-back. "I'm a coach who likes to work with an established system," Van Marwijk said a month ago while expressing worries about Van Gaal's switches to 5-3-2. Van Gaal has proved himself to be exactly the opposite, while the bravery of his switches -- the introduction of Tim Krul against Costa Rica, in particular -- has masked flat spots like those against Australia, Mexico and in the weekend's quarterfinal. De Jong has been resurrected as a key man, a lone holder to please the Dutch aesthetic, and there was much hope on Tuesday that he could return from his thigh injury. What would seem a less able squad than 2010's, with considerably less experience, has reached the edge of matching, and maybe even surpassing, their fated forebears.	sports
Epic rivals reunite in Sao Paulo - ESPN FC	Having settled it like no one else could, Dennis Bergkamp summed it up like no one else could. "You're in that moment," the former Netherlands No. 10 told UK Magazine The Blizzard. "That moment", of course, was the goal; his historic and hysterically excellent strike in the Netherlands' 2-1 victory over Argentina in the 1998 World Cup quarterfinals. "That's the feeling," Bergkamp enthused. "After the first two touches, that moment! You give absolutely everything. It's like your life has led up this moment. "You never play the perfect game. But the moment itself was, I think, perfect." It's certainly difficult to dispute. Consider the dimensions, and not just of Frank De Boer's supremely flighted long-range diagonal pass to find Bergkamp in the first place. That came in the last minute of a match in which both sides were dramatically reduced to 10 men but all had given 100 percent. Somehow, Bergkamp still had more to offer. Dennis Bergkamp's spectacular winner against Argentina is still one of the greatest goals ever in the World Cup. He provided a finesse that transcended such figures, that went beyond normal descriptions. It went beyond normal talent. Sprinting at almost full pace, the forward still had the awareness and precision to kill the ball with one touch, take Roberto Ayala completely out of the picture with the next, and then deliver the deftest of finishes. The economy of touch and space were the inverse of the outlandish excellence. Rarely has one moment seen such a maximisation of talent in such minimalist circumstances. Rarely has one action so defined and reflected a single player's entire career. Rarely has such a high-profile and brilliant match seen such an appropriate crescendo. Speaking on the eve of the latest rematch between the Netherlands and Argentina, on the even more elevated World Cup stage of the semifinals, Javier Mascherano recalled his emotions. The midfielder, who was 14 at the time, can remember exactly where he was, but then few could forget it. "I was at home watching it on television and I was just as disappointed as everyone else." Well, every one else who was Argentinean, that is. The rest of the football-watching world couldn't help but be uplifted, even elated. It has also been something of a theme of this fixture. If Bergkamp is right and there is no "perfect game", these two countries possibly provide the perfect knockout pairing.

Angel Di Maria injury Argentina - ESPN FC	Angel Di Maria has played a crucial role in helping Argentina reach the semifinals and his absence is a setback for La Albiceleste. In years to come, we might well remember Lionel Messi's pass to Ángel Di María during the first half of Argentina vs. Belgium as one of the best in World Cup history. I suspect, however, that most will be less quick to remember what happened next; a cut inside and a shot from Di María which resulted in him pulling up. Minutes later he had to be substituted and the following day Argentina's head doctor Daniel Martínez confirmed he'll miss Wednesday's semifinal against Netherlands. Di María's technical and tactical abilities are important for Argentina, of course, but they're arguably secondary and tertiary, in some ways, to the one thing that sets him aside from almost every other player in the world: the ability to run, run, run some more and then keep running long after everyone else has stopped. - McIntyre: Robben vs. Messi -- Stars collide - Top Tenner: World Cup semifinals So how will Argentina be affected by not having their Duracell bunny in midfield? There are a couple of possibilities and at the time of writing it's not clear which Alejandro Sabella is going to use. The first is that Argentina stick to the rough 4-4-2 they employed against Belgium, with Ezequiel Lavezzi on the left of midfield, bringing a replacement in on the right. That might be Benfica midfielder Enzo Pérez -- the tactically versatile utility man who had an excellent season just gone as a defensive midfielder but can also play further forward -- or it could be former Liverpool winger Maxi Rodríguez. Pérez replaced Di María against Belgium but of course by the time that happened Argentina were already a goal up, so whether Sabella will go with him from the start if the 4-4-2 is the system of choice isn't clear. All the same, the Benfica player seems to be the favourite at present to start on the right. That could change, however, if Sabella decides that the best way to counter the threat of the Dutch attack is a return to the 5-3-2 used in the opening match against Bosnia-Herzegovina. Marcos Rojo seems set to return from suspension at left back whatever, so the back five would see José Basanta move into the middle and Ezequiel Lavezzi dropped from left midfield to accommodate Rojo; Rojo and Basanta would thus be charged with doubling up on Arjen Robben on the Dutch right. If that strategy is used, it seems most likely that Argentina's midfield three would consist (from right to left) of Pérez, Javier Mascherano and Lucas Biglia. That seems uninspiring, but crucially it has a lot more balance to it than the midfield three used so poorly in the Bosnia-Herzegovina match; Maxi Rodríguez played on the right in that trio (with Mascherano and Di María), and hared up the pitch every time Argentina won the ball back, leaving Mascherano with no-one to give it to. Clearly, however Argentina line up they'll be weaker for Di María's exclusion. Whether he's played well or not, his running has provided a spark from midfield to complement Lionel Messi's iron will and nerves of steel which have defined Argentina's tournament so far. Without Di María, adaptation will be essential for Argentina's survival. On Wednesday, we'll learn a lot about just how versatile this side really are.	sports
Brazil's 7 stages of grief against Germany in the World Cup - ESPN FC	SAO PAULO -- The fireworks, blasts like cannons, were going off hours before the game. Not very many went off after. Anticipation had given way to humiliation, and by now this giant city seems to have accepted it. Brazil's historic defeat by the Germans might have been just bad enough to save us. There have been fears, spoken of surprisingly often and openly, about what terrible things would happen if Brazil failed to win this World Cup -- something seen by some here almost as a divine right, a function of pure destiny. Mostly, people had talked about how sideways the world might go if the hosts lost to the hated Argentines in the final. Then every clamp and governor that had been thrown onto this crackling country -- most of the pre-tournament anger having subsided once the games began -- would be released. In the absence of any reason for unity, a potentially violent division would return. It turns out a more decisive cataclysm was coming. Tens of thousands, fenced in by police and metal barricades, packed into the FIFA Fan Fest in Sao Paulo's downtown core before Tuesday night's game. There were concerts and banners and sloshing cups of beer, the familiar motions of celebration, but in truth it was already a kind of limited buoyancy. With Neymar's injury and Thiago Silva's suspension, local hopes had been muted. But they were still there, if under the surface. The anthem wasn't sung so much as it was shouted, and then the whistle blew. Brazil 1-7 Germany -- reaction - Marcotti: Scolari at a loss to explain - Jones: Seven stages of grief for Brazil - Duarte: Haunting defeat for the Selecao - Delaney: Three Points - Brazil broken by Germany - Low: German plan worked perfectly - Behind the Numbers: Germany's historic win - Photo Gallery: Best of Brazil vs. Germany - Klose breaks World Cup goals record | Highlight - Social reaction: Brazil, did that just happen? Then the Germans did what they did -- and so quickly -- with each of their seven goals serving as another of the makeshift stages of accelerated Brazilian grief. The first was met with anxiety, the second with anger, the third with disappointment, the fourth with disbelief. Then came bemusement, surprisingly enough -- some percentage of the thinning crowd that remained actually began cheering for the Germans -- and then understanding and finally acceptance. If there were still a bomb set to go off, the late Brazilian goal, that slim measure of pride, cut the last wire. By then, though, there was no longer any sense of real danger here, no feeling that riots were about to kick off. There were too many police, for starters, but more importantly, there wasn't really anything for the crowd to be angry about. This was a brutal defeat, but it contained no injustice or heartbreak. Brazil -- this Brazil -- just weren't good enough to win the World Cup, even given the advantages of home. They had barely beaten Chile, and they had struggled to hold on against the Colombians. Brazilians had remained hopeful their boys would continue to win, but it felt more and more as though they had stopped believing they would. After they had been made doubtless, they left and went home, or they stumbled into bars in search of one last commiserating drink. Some even thought to blow their air horns, almost ironic screams of defiance against the dark. Maybe the coming days will turn ugly, and fears will come true. Maybe this country will feel the way any of us does when houseguests linger too long. Maybe, for the first time in its history, Brazil will want the party to be over. But right now it doesn't feel that way. It doesn't feel like much of anything. Right now Sao Paulo feels like any other city in the world, except bigger, lit up, buzzing and perhaps even relieved to have joined the World Cup's ever expanding ranks of the abruptly detached.	sports
Raphael Honigstein - Germany must capitalise on their superb semifinal win over Brazil. - ESPN FC	7-1. It was a historic result in Belo Horizonte, probably the most outrageous scoreline that will ever be recorded in World Cup football. But Germany's aim -- make that their absolute, fundamental need -- will be to make sure they won't just be remembered for that "miracle" against a shell-shocked, completely devastated Brazil. Joachim Low's men, however, have to come home with more than happy memories of a semifinal win. You could see it in the faces of the players of the final whistle. They almost felt sorry for beating the Selecao by such a exuberant margin. They didn't take pleasure in inflicting this amount of pain. They just wanted to get the job done. Celebrations, euphoria? No, thanks. "A bit of humility is in order now," said a very collected Low. "We move on. We have to make sure we will stay focused." Thomas Muller, too, pleaded for a sense of perspective. "After the Algeria game, they slaughtered us," said the Bayern forward and scorer of the all-important first goal. "Now they want to elevate us to the heavens. That's the wrong approach. We are simply a pretty good team." Muller, 24, probably meant it. Germany are a pretty good team. Just doing their thing, playing at an acceptable level. They can still play better. In all likelihood, they will have to play better on Sunday in Rio. Brazil 1-7 Germany -- reaction - Marcotti: Scolari at a loss to explain - Jones: Seven stages of grief for Brazil - Duarte: Haunting defeat for the Selecao - Delaney: Three Points - Brazil broken by Germany - Low: German plan worked perfectly - Behind the Numbers: Germany's historic win - Photo Gallery: Best of Brazil vs. Germany - Klose breaks World Cup goals record | Highlight - Social reaction: Brazil, did that just happen? In that assessment, there was the recognition that Brazil had made it easy by losing their heads and running into an "open knife," as the saying in Germany goes. All Muller & Co. had to do was watch Luiz Felipe Scolari's rudderless, overawed side impale themselves. After the fourth or fifth goal, the law of diminishing returns kicked in. The six Bayern Munich players on the pitch for Germany (Manuel Neuer, Jerome Boateng, Toni Kroos, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Philipp Lahm and Thomas Muller) would have recognised the symptoms: with every additional goal, your achievement becomes smaller, along with the perceived level of quality of the opposition. This Brazil team were still Brazil, however -- in Brazil. General manager Oliver Bierhoff had described Germany's chances to win the World Cup in South America as virtually impossible not long ago, and a lot of people had bought into the argument. Low had dared to disagree at the time, but only quietly. Now, it's no longer a question whether they win but whether they'll somehow not win it. Whoever joins them in the final will be ranked outsiders. That will present its own challenges. But this wasn't the night to start worrying about that. Joachim Low's men have completed the job against Brazil. It's now time to focus on the final. By the end of the 90 minutes in Belo Horizonte, it was churlish to think of this game as revenge for the 2-0 defeat in the 2002 final. There had been no account to settle to begin with. A very different Brazil won in Yokohama against a very different Germany team. Rudi Voller's team didn't expect to make it that far. They shouldn't have made it that far. They got to the final by the skin of their teeth and a series of 1-0 wins (versus USA, Paraguay, South Korea), thanks to an inspired Oliver Kahn in goal, the inspirational captain Michael Ballack, and a disciplined, selfless supporting cast who ran, toiled, ran and toiled. Nobody really thought they should beat the Brazil of Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho. Ironically, Voller's team played their best game of the tournament and nearly caused an upset but upon their return, they were feted like plucky underdogs, enjoyable losers who had done the best with the limited possibilities at their disposal. You don't cry for revenge when you know that your defeat was fully deserved. There was no element of revenge in Germany's 2014 rout -- the 2002 defeat was against a superior opponent. The 7-1 win over the same opponents in what was only the second meeting at this level was not payback, nor retribution, nor did it have much to do with Brazil at all. By reaching their first World Cup final since 2002, a random semi-success sandwiched in between the worst tournament performances since World War II (Euro 2000, Euro 2004), they have done something a bit bigger: They've reestablished themselves at a level and status that they last enjoyed 20 years ago. This Germany, this "pretty good team," are back at the very top of international football. The uncertain, unnerving times of decline (1990-1998), of stagnation (2002), of fragile renaissance (2006) and unfinished improvement (2010-2012) are over. Low's Germany no longer have to wonder where they're going. They have arrived. All that's left to do now is to make sure that they don't come down from the historic highs of this tournament empty-handed.

Thiago Silva proves to be bigger loss than Neymar for Brazil - ESPN FC	When Neymar was stretchered off the field in the dying moments of Brazil's quarterfinal victory over Colombia on Friday, Brazil fans feared the worst. Confirmation came from the hospital soon after: the forward had fractured a vertebra and would miss the rest of the World Cup. Immediately, the speculation began over how Luiz Felipe Scolari would set his side up to counteract the absence of its talisman and top scorer against Germany. Pick an extra central midfielder and hope for a goal from a set piece? Start Willian wide and give Oscar a more central role? No one could replace Neymar's star quality, of course, but there were decisions to be made, plans to be foiled. Yet amid all the bluster, it was almost forgotten that Brazil would be missing another key player in the semifinal. And in the event, Thiago Silva, suspended after picking up a silly booking against Colombia, would prove the more telling loss. It meant Brazil was without the defensive partnership that has proven so fundamental to their form over the past 18 months. The Selecao did not lose a single one of the games Thiago and David Luiz started together -- and won 21. There would be no such safety net against Germany. Although Napoli defender Henrique is an old Palmeiras cohort of Scolari's, there was really only one choice to step into the back line. Dante has long been viewed as a capable enough understudy and had performed well when called upon in the Confederations Cup this past summer, with a vital goal in the win over Italy. He had the added advantage of knowing the Germany players inside out, having spent the past few seasons playing with and against them in the Bundesliga. That experience, Scolari hoped, would prove important at the Mineirao. Dante's Bundesliga experience did little to help him against Germany on Tuesday. In the end, it counted for nothing. Dante and the rest of the Brazilian defence were given the run-around by a Germany side who seemed hell-bent on redefining the word ruthless. As the goals rattled in, cameras cut to Thiago sitting in the stands and watching through his fingers. How he must have wished he could have been out there to steady his teammates. It would be wrong to lay all the blame at Dante's door. This, after all, was a rout mapped out by the metronomic midfield passing triangles upon which Germany's recent success has been built. With Scolari electing to start Bernard instead of Paulinho, Toni Kroos, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Sami Khedira had the run of the midfield and poured forward at will. Luiz Gustavo and Fernandinho were outnumbered and overwhelmed. It was notable, however, that Germany had so much joy down Brazil's left. Thomas Muller slipped into the space between Dante and Marcelo time and again, swapped passes with the oppressively tidy Philipp Lahm and ghosted into the area unchecked. He was an itch the Selecao just could not scratch. On the other flank, Maicon, preferred to Dani Alves once again, had a touch more joy against Mesut Ozil -- but only a touch. There are no defensive heroes in a 7-1 defeat, after all. Brazil 1-7 Germany -- reaction - Marcotti: Scolari at a loss to explain - Jones: Seven stages of grief for Brazil - Duarte: Haunting defeat for the Selecao - Delaney: Three Points - Brazil broken by Germany - Low: German plan worked perfectly - Behind the Numbers: Germany's historic win - Photo Gallery: Best of Brazil vs. Germany - Klose breaks World Cup goals record | Highlight - Social reaction: Brazil, did that just happen? Scolari admitted after the game that Brazil had lost their bearings during that staggering first-half salvo. "I couldn't change anything ... it was one goal after another," the former Chelsea manager said. "There was nothing to be done during that breakdown." Luiz, who entered the field looking steely and left it in floods of tears, was perhaps the most culpable of all Brazil's defenders, having lost Muller for the opener and tried too hard to make amends thereafter. "I want to say sorry to all Brazilians," he sniffed after the final whistle. "It's a day of great sadness, the end of a dream." Really, though, it was more brutal than that -- a nightmare, perhaps. This was a night when Brazil's defence crumbled and, with it, their hopes of lifting the World Cup.	sports
Sporting humiliations after Germany thrash Brazil 7-1 - ESPN FC	Brazil's World Cup hopes were not just ended but shattered in the most emphatic of styles by Germany on Tuesday night. Four goals in the space of just seven first-half minutes silenced an entire nation and the shell-shocked hosts eventually lost their semifinal 7-1. Here are some other results which have resulted in red faces. ENGLAND'S CRICKETERS England toured the West Indies in 1994 and in the Third Test at the Queen's Park Oval in Trinidad, were set 194 to win after Andy Caddick returned six for 65 to put his side in control. But the tourists were soon left reeling with Alec Stewart their only batsman to score double figures with 18. England were humbled out for 46 and lost by 147 runs. Fast forward to 2013 and another England team were torn apart on foreign soil. After retaining the Ashes at home in the Summer, Alastair Cook's men took an alarming fast track to a 5-0 Ashes whitewash with a 281-run defeat inside three days in the final Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Cook's hapless tourists arguably plumbed new depths in an already embarrassing campaign as they collapsed yet again, in notional pursuit of a world-record 448 to win, to 166 all out. MANCHESTER UNITED 1-6 MANCHESTER CITY Mario Balotelli provided the spark as City stormed Old Trafford to humiliate rivals United 6-1 as the Italy striker struck twice against 10-man United, who saw defender Jonny Evans sent off. Edin Dzeko scored twice and Sergio Aguero and David Silva added to the tally, while United claimed a consolation through Darren Fletcher but they were ran ragged in the dying moments as City struck three times after the 88th minute. City's victory lifted them five points clear of rivals United and shattered a host of statistics. In recording only their second win at Old Trafford since 1974, City inflicted United's first home defeat since April 2010 and ended their run of 19 consecutive home league wins. SEATTLE SEAHAWKS 43-8 DENVER BRONCOS The Seattle Seahawks produced one of the most dominant performances in Super Bowl history as Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos were crushed 43-8. Ahead of the clash, much focus was on Manning -- just voted the NFL's MVP for the fifth time in his career having led the most prolific offence of all time this year. But, after being gifted a safety on the first play for the quickest ever Super Bowl score, the anticipated 'contest' quickly became a blow-out as Seattle controlled proceedings throughout. CHELSEA 6-0 ARSENAL Arsenal embarrassingly capitulated in Arsene Wenger's 1,000th match in charge with a 6-0 loss to Premier League leaders Chelsea after a spectacular implosion and an horrendous mistake by referee Andre Marriner. The Frenchman watched on helplessly after two goals in three first-half minutes from Samuel Eto'o and Andre Schurrle gave Chelsea a handsome lead before Marriner sent off Kieran Gibbs for a handball committed by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Eden Hazard converted a penalty to give the Blues a 3-0 advantage, Oscar added a fourth before the interval, a fifth after 66 minutes and Mohamed Salah sealed the win. MIKE TYSON vs. BUSTER DOUGLAS One part humiliation, one part shock for this. Tyson was the undispusted heavyweight champion of the world when he met 42/1 rank outsider Buster Douglas in Tokyo in 1990. 'Iron Mike' got it all horribly wrong, though, and was knocked out in the 10th round for a result that remains one of boxing's most famous. Tyson would never be at the peak of his powers again and his career became more infamous than famous. RORY McILROY, THE MASTERS Northern Irishman McIlroy played near perfect golf across the first three days in Augusta to lead the field by four shots in pursuit of his first major. His fourth round was the worst recorded by any professional leading after the third round of the Masters. One over after the front nine, he still lead, but he signed for 80 and finished tied for 15th. To his credit, though, he headed back to America two months later to win the US Open.	sports
Netherlands vs. Argentina: 50-50 Challenge - ESPN FC	It's a repeat of the 1978 World Cup final as the Netherlands face Argentina in Sao Paulo on Wednesday, with just one more match between the teams and a place at the Maracana. The Netherlands reached the final in 2010 while Argentina, winners 36 years ago, are in the semifinals for the fourth time in their history. Elko Born (Netherlands) and Sam Kelly (Argentina) preview the clash. Sum up your tournament so far Elko Born: The tournament has been a dream so far, with everything going right at exactly the right moment, from Robin van Persie's wonder goal in the first match to Arjen Robben's form and manager Louis van Gaal's audacious substitution against Costa Rica. There is almost a feeling the match against Argentina can hardly go wrong. Should the Argentines take the lead then surely Robben or Van Persie will step up or Van Gaal will come up with more magic. Sam Kelly: Historic. It's not been as free-scoring as Argentina would have liked and it's been very nervy at times, but the Rubicon has been crossed; for the first time since 1930, Argentina have reached a World Cup semifinal without either being the host nation (1978) or having Diego Maradona in the squad (1986 and 1990). And for the first time since losing the 1990 final -- the third World Cup final out of four that Argentina had featured in -- they've got past the quarters. It's not been all sunshine and roses. They've lost Angel Di Maria for the semifinal at least and there might be a minor concern about some of the finishing on Saturday, because in truth given how the game went, Argentina should probably have beaten Belgium by more than one goal. But key changes were made and worked, and key players who hadn't previously stepped up (I'm looking at you, Gonzalo Higuain) did so magnificently. Everything might finally be coming together. World Cup history between the two countries EB: There is, of course, Dennis Bergkamp's classic goal in the quarterfinal of the World Cup in 1998. But the most memorable match between the Netherlands and Argentina was played in 1978, when the countries faced each other in the final of the World Cup. The Netherlands, still disappointed from narrowly missing out on the ultimate prize in 1974, lost 2-1 after extra time and were once again left empty-handed. This, as you can imagine, has not been forgotten. Among fans and in the media, the word "revenge" is being tossed around. SK: This will be the fifth meeting between these nations at the World Cup. The Netherlands have won two -- a 4-0 win in Gelsenkirchen on their way to the final in 1974, and a 2-1 win in Marseille in 1998, decided by that brilliant Bergkamp effort as Elko says. The most recent meeting, during the 2006 group stage, brought the only competitive draw between the sides, a 0-0 in Frankfurt. Argentina's sole World Cup win -- indeed, their only win, because they've never won a friendly -- against the Netherlands was the 3-1 extra-time victory (it had finished 1-1 after 90 minutes) in the Estadio Monumental in the final of the 1978 World Cup. For most Argentines, 1978 is a tainted victory due to the military junta's attempts (very possibly successful) to swing things the home side's way. As such, taking out the Netherlands this time round could also be painted as a win over one of the darker parts of Argentina's own history (off the pitch as well as on it). What are your expectations for the rest of the tournament? EB: Ahead of the tournament most fans did not expect the Netherlands to get very far. Consequently, reaching the semifinal can already be seen as a huge success. But after a series of convincing victories, the Dutch now think they can win the World Cup and with the empowering feeling of confidence now instilled in the Oranje, it is difficult to simply dismiss this assertion completely. After the lost finals of 1974, 1978 and 2010, will it finally happen? Or is desire clouding judgement too much, and have the Dutch been a little lucky to get this far? - Macintosh: Van Gaal has gumption to spare SK: Two very tight semifinals but, just possibly, a more open final. As for how Argentina will do in their final two matches, they need to improve still, but the good news is that they already seem to have begun to step things up somewhat. Excellent in the first half against a Belgium side that offered them more space than they'd had in the previous round, they could have been further ahead but controlled the game pretty effectively even without the ball in the second half. Of the changes last time, Marcos Rojo should return from suspension to replace Jose Basanta at left-back, but Martin Demichelis will surely keep his place alongside Ezequiel Garay in the centre of defence; Demichelis looked far better than Federico Fernandez, and crucially Garay also looked more at ease with the experience of the Manchester City man alongside him. Given their potential for improvement and the fact they've done so in small bursts so far in the tournament, I think Argentina are narrow favourites for the semi -- particularly with Nigel de Jong injured for the Netherlands. Angel Di Maria's injury is a setback for Argentina, who have benefitted from the Real Madrid man's tireless running. Key battle EB: As one of the best footballers of the world, Lionel Messi is the man the Netherlands fear most, and without the injured defensive midfielder Nigel de Jong, the relatively inexperienced Dutch defence will have to be on their guard. In the case of Messi, though -- and in true Dutch fashion -- the best defence might be the attack. The battle between Argentina and the Netherlands will be a battle between Messi and Robben, the Netherlands' star man up front. On the day of the semifinal, who will perform best? And more importantly: Who will score the most goals? SK: Messi vs. Georginio Wijnaldum. In De Jong's absence, Wijnaldum (and Wesley Sneijder) seems likely to be asked to sit a little deeper in midfield to counter Messi's threat in front of the Dutch defence. If that sounds risky, it could well be; we saw in the first half against Belgium how much Messi finally enjoyed being given the space that came with having just one man marking him, as he produced some wonderful probing passes, including probably the through-ball of the finals so far to set Di Maria up for the shot from which the winger seemed to pick up his injury. It's clear -- all but impossible to deny -- that Argentina rely on Messi, and even with their bit-by-bit improvements so far, that's not likely to change here, particularly with Di Maria out of the equation. If Messi gets the space in midfield to pick up a head of steam on the ball, he could be very dangerous -- perhaps decisively so. Elsewhere on the pitch, how Marcos Rojo deals with Arjen Robben on the Dutch right/Argentine left will also prove important. - Vickery: Argentina fail to thrill Prediction EB: Having seen Dennis Bergkamp's wonder goal against Argentina in 1998 as a child, Robben or Van Persie will feel inspired to do something similar in the dying seconds of the match. The Netherlands will win 2-1. SK: It's very tight to call, but I'm going for Argentina to edge it by a goal again; if I were Dutch, the lack of bite in defensive midfield would be a worry coming up against Messi, while Argentina's own defensive errors were notably less of a problem with Demichelis stepping into the back line against Belgium.	sports
Germany's lopsided win makes statistical history - ESPN FC	Germany's remarkable opening half-hour gave them a 5-0 lead against Brazil and made history in a number of ways -- as did Brazil's defeat. A look at the top facts from Tuesday's 7-1 semifinal: High-flying Germany • By scoring Germany's second goal, Miroslav Klose became the most prolific goal scorer in World Cup history. Klose now has 16 World Cup goals in his career, breaking a tie with Brazil's Ronaldo. • Germany scored five goals in the first 29 minutes, the fastest any team has scored five goals in any game in World Cup history. Yugoslavia scored five in 30 minutes against Zaire in 1974. • Germany are the first team to score five goals in the first half of any World Cup game since Poland against Haiti in 1974 (Yugoslavia scored six against Zaire in the first half one day earlier), and the first in a knockout-stage game since Austria beat Switzerland in 1954. • Germany's seven goals broke a record for most scored in a semifinal, previously at six, held by Uruguay and Argentina in 1930, and West Germany in 1954. No one had even scored five in a semi since Brazil beat France 5-2 in 1958.  • The six-goal margin of victory also broke the record of five in World Cup semifinals. • Germany are now the all-time top scoring team in World Cup history with 223 goals. They passed Brazil at 220 in the first half. • Germany have taken a 5-0 lead three previous times in the World Cup -- against Saudi Arabia in 2002 (8-0 final), Mexico in 1978 (6-0) and Switzerland in 1966 (5-0). • Germany reached the World Cup final for the eighth time, more times than any other country. • Thomas Muller is the 13th player to score 10 career World Cup goals, and the second player to score five goals at consecutive World Cups after Klose in 2002 and 2006. Miroslav Klose and Germany flew out to a 5-0 lead in the first half against Brazil en route to a 7-1 win. Grounded Brazil • Brazil's six-goal defeat equals their worst loss in team history -- 6-0 to Uruguay in the 1920 Copa America. • Brazil had not allowed five goals in an entire World Cup since 1998. They allowed four in five matches in 2010, two in five matches in 2006, and four in seven matches in 2002. • Brazil had never before trailed by four goals in any World Cup match. That's 102 previous matches. • Brazil have allowed five goals in official games just eight times -- six in 1940 or earlier, and twice in 1963. Six goals? Not since 1940. Seven? Not since an 8-4 friendly defeat to Yugoslavia in 1934. • The previous worst defeats for a host nation at a World Cup were by three goals -- South Africa's 3-0 loss to Uruguay in 2010, Mexico's 4-1 loss to Italy in 1970 and Sweden's 5-2 loss to Brazil in the 1958 final. • Brazil lost at home in a competitive match for the first time since the 1975 Copa America to Peru -- a period of 63 games. • The last time Brazil lost a World Cup match at home was the 1950 final, which caused the team to change its kit.	sports
Strikers making way for playmakers - ESPN FC	Time is running out for Miroslav Klose. It's precious and of the essence to him. At 36, the Germany striker is playing in his final World Cup. Every game has threatened to be his last since the knockout stage began. Tuesday's semifinal match against Brazil in Belo Horizonte is no different. Klose is hoping to have a place in the starting XI for his fourth consecutive World Cup semifinal. So far in this World Cup, he's made cameo appearances as a substitute and one start, playing only 135 minutes overall. Klose's aim upon making the squad was to score two goals in Brazil. The veteran Lazio forward has managed only one, sliding in at the far post to equalise against Ghana in the group stage. That strike meant Klose matched Ronaldo on 15 goals as the all-time leading scorer in World Cup history. Imagine if Klose were to break the record against Brazil. Wouldn't that be something? If the moment comes, he will have to seize it. And besides, Klose should perhaps consider himself lucky to be in the Germany squad at all. He is the only nominal centre-forward Low decided to take. Germany's talent distribution, after all, is disproportionately in or between the lines of midfield and attack. Still, the prevailing sensation from this World Cup is that it has been hard on the orthodox striker in general. That might sound foolish considering 2.8 goals per game were scored during the group stages. Were centre-forwards not among them? Didn't they take advantage? Not as much as you'd think. Of the players classified as more or less typical No. 9s, only Karim Benzema (even though he wears No. 10), Robin van Persie (a self-proclaimed 9 and a half), Wilfried Bony, Mario Mandzukic, Jackson Martinez, Clint Dempsey, Asamoah Gyan, Islam Slimani and Enner Valencia scored two or more goals. Miroslav Klose needs just one more goal to break Ronaldo's record as the World Cup's all-time record goal scorer. It's perhaps a surprise considering that some countries came into the World Cup with frightening firepower. Argentina looked top-heavy, as did Colombia in spite of Radamel Falcao's injury-enforced absence, while Uruguay's strike partnership of Edinson Cavani and Luis Suarez is about to become the most expensive in aggregated transfer fees (although they played together for only 178 minutes on account of Suarez's recovery from knee surgery and then his bite on Giorgio Chiellini). For several reasons varying from poor form to issues of fitness and not being in the side, few have imposed themselves on the tournament. Argentina's Gonzalo Higuain, for instance, only got on the score sheet in the quarterfinals against Belgium. Many are asking whether he could follow in the footsteps of Italy's Paolo Rossi in 1982. The World Cup winner didn't find the back of the net until his fifth appearance in Spain and then couldn't stop in a blaze of glory. Argentines are sure hoping Higuain imitates Rossi. Argentina's latent potential up front, how they've kept their powder dry (or at least put it in the hands of one man), could yet spark. Brazil, meanwhile, have little or no gunpowder to speak of. Losing Neymar (another player wearing the symbolic No. 10 shirt on his shoulders, and a wide forward, too, rather than one through the centre) has laid bare how, unlike in years gone by, Brazil no longer have a multitude of world-class, go-to goal scorers. Fred, the leading striker at last summer's Confederations Cup, has become a figure of fun, even if it must be recognised that he is or has been a facilitator for Neymar as much as a finisher for Brazil -- not quite Serginho in 1982, but hardly Stephane Guivarc'h in 1998 either. Then there's Jo. There must be regret that more wasn't done to get Diego Costa to commit to Brazil. His forward play would have been more suited to Brazil's style than to Spain's. He chose Spain -- possibly because he wasn't fully fit. And to be fair, the only European striker who has appeared to meet, if not exceed, expectation at the World Cup is Benzema. The other, more prolific players from the Continent are the unclassifiable Muller, his Bayern teammates (Switzerland's Xherdan Shaqiri and Netherlands winger Arjen Robben) and Robin van Persie. Brazil vs. Germany: Tuesday, 4 ET, 9 BST (ESPN and WatchESPN) - Marcotti: Titans collide in the semifinals - Honigstein: Bierhoff's technological focus - Torre: Scolari lightens the mood - Brewin: Battered Brazil vs. vulnerable Germany - Smith: Jogo bonito the exception, not the rule - 50-50 Challenge: Brazil vs. Germany - Duarte: Brazil move past star absences - Cox: Brazil and Germany's role reversal There are no foxes in the box, no bulls at the gate. The scoring charts reflect that. As in 1974 and 2010, when Grzegorz Lato -- a wide player -- and Muller won it, the Golden Boot is likely to go to a non-centre-forward. Colombia's No. 10, James Rodriguez, is still in pole position on six goals. He is pursued by Argentina's Lionel Messi -- one of the greatest goal scorers of all time but not a No. 9. Level with him on four goals, though unable to add to it, is Brazil's Neymar. Then, of course, there's right-place, right-time Muller. What's clear is that there is no Eusebio, Gerd Muller, Mario Kempes, Paolo Rossi, Gary Lineker, Salvatore Schillaci, Hristo Stoichkov, Oleg Salenko, Davor Suker or Ronaldo to speak of. This World Cup has arguably been crying out for one in the knockout stages: six of the eight round-of-16 games were 0-0 at halftime. This has been a World Cup of the No. 1s and No. 10s, not the No. 9s. That's a consequence of modern football -- the prevalence of one-striker and striker-less systems, the preoccupation with not giving your opponent any reference points, and the widening brief of the centre-forward to participate and link up play, to move and drag opponents out of the way to create space for his teammates. Scoring goals used to be his only job. Now a striker is asked to do much more. It brings nostalgia for a Gerd Muller, a Pippo Inzaghi. "He loved goals," Alessandro Del Piero once said of his former Juventus and Italy teammate, "but not as much as the goal loved him." The same is true of Klose. So if you're a neutral fan, will him to score Tuesday night. Do it for your team. Do it for yourself. Do it for the record. But above all, do it for the good old No. 9.

Argentina looked top-heavy, as did Colombia in spite of Radamel Falcao's injury-enforced absence, while Uruguay's strike partnership of Edinson Cavani and Luis Suarez is about to become the most expensive in aggregated transfer fees (although they played together for only 178 minutes on account of Suarez's recovery from knee surgery and then his bite on Giorgio Chiellini). For several reasons varying from poor form to issues of fitness and not being in the side, few have imposed themselves on the tournament. Argentina's Gonzalo Higuain, for instance, only got on the score sheet in the quarterfinals against Belgium. Many are asking whether he could follow in the footsteps of Italy's Paolo Rossi in 1982. The World Cup winner didn't find the back of the net until his fifth appearance in Spain and then couldn't stop in a blaze of glory. Argentines are sure hoping Higuain imitates Rossi. Argentina's latent potential up front, how they've kept their powder dry (or at least put it in the hands of one man), could yet spark. Brazil, meanwhile, have little or no gunpowder to speak of. Losing Neymar (another player wearing the symbolic No. 10 shirt on his shoulders, and a wide forward, too, rather than one through the centre) has laid bare how, unlike in years gone by, Brazil no longer have a multitude of world-class, go-to goal scorers. Fred, the leading striker at last summer's Confederations Cup, has become a figure of fun, even if it must be recognised that he is or has been a facilitator for Neymar as much as a finisher for Brazil -- not quite Serginho in 1982, but hardly Stephane Guivarc'h in 1998 either. Then there's Jo. There must be regret that more wasn't done to get Diego Costa to commit to Brazil. His forward play would have been more suited to Brazil's style than to Spain's. He chose Spain -- possibly because he wasn't fully fit. And to be fair, the only European striker who has appeared to meet, if not exceed, expectation at the World Cup is Benzema. The other, more prolific players from the Continent are the unclassifiable Muller, his Bayern teammates (Switzerland's Xherdan Shaqiri and Netherlands winger Arjen Robben) and Robin van Persie. Brazil vs. Germany: Tuesday, 4 ET, 9 BST (ESPN and WatchESPN) - Marcotti: Titans collide in the semifinals - Honigstein: Bierhoff's technological focus - Torre: Scolari lightens the mood - Brewin: Battered Brazil vs. vulnerable Germany - Smith: Jogo bonito the exception, not the rule - 50-50 Challenge: Brazil vs. Germany - Duarte: Brazil move past star absences - Cox: Brazil and Germany's role reversal There are no foxes in the box, no bulls at the gate. The scoring charts reflect that. As in 1974 and 2010, when Grzegorz Lato -- a wide player -- and Muller won it, the Golden Boot is likely to go to a non-centre-forward. Colombia's No. 10, James Rodriguez, is still in pole position on six goals. He is pursued by Argentina's Lionel Messi -- one of the greatest goal scorers of all time but not a No. 9. Level with him on four goals, though unable to add to it, is Brazil's Neymar. Then, of course, there's right-place, right-time Muller. What's clear is that there is no Eusebio, Gerd Muller, Mario Kempes, Paolo Rossi, Gary Lineker, Salvatore Schillaci, Hristo Stoichkov, Oleg Salenko, Davor Suker or Ronaldo to speak of. This World Cup has arguably been crying out for one in the knockout stages: six of the eight round-of-16 games were 0-0 at halftime. This has been a World Cup of the No. 1s and No. 10s, not the No. 9s. That's a consequence of modern football -- the prevalence of one-striker and striker-less systems, the preoccupation with not giving your opponent any reference points, and the widening brief of the centre-forward to participate and link up play, to move and drag opponents out of the way to create space for his teammates. Scoring goals used to be his only job. Now a striker is asked to do much more. It brings nostalgia for a Gerd Muller, a Pippo Inzaghi. "He loved goals," Alessandro Del Piero once said of his former Juventus and Italy teammate, "but not as much as the goal loved him." The same is true of Klose. So if you're a neutral fan, will him to score Tuesday night. Do it for your team. Do it for yourself. Do it for the record. But above all, do it for the good old No. 9.

Thiago Silva proves to be bigger loss than Neymar for Brazil - ESPN FC	When Neymar was stretchered off the field in the dying moments of Brazil's quarterfinal victory over Colombia on Friday, Brazil fans feared the worst. Confirmation came from the hospital soon after: the forward had fractured a vertebra and would miss the rest of the World Cup. Immediately, the speculation began over how Luiz Felipe Scolari would set his side up to counteract the absence of its talisman and top scorer against Germany. Pick an extra central midfielder and hope for a goal from a set piece? Start Willian wide and give Oscar a more central role? No one could replace Neymar's star quality, of course, but there were decisions to be made, plans to be foiled. Yet amid all the bluster, it was almost forgotten that Brazil would be missing another key player in the semifinal. And in the event, Thiago Silva, suspended after picking up a silly booking against Colombia, would prove the more telling loss. It meant Brazil was without the defensive partnership that has proven so fundamental to their form over the past 18 months. The Selecao did not lose a single one of the games Thiago and David Luiz started together -- and won 21. There would be no such safety net against Germany. Although Napoli defender Henrique is an old Palmeiras cohort of Scolari's, there was really only one choice to step into the back line. Dante has long been viewed as a capable enough understudy and had performed well when called upon in the Confederations Cup this past summer, with a vital goal in the win over Italy. He had the added advantage of knowing the Germany players inside out, having spent the past few seasons playing with and against them in the Bundesliga. That experience, Scolari hoped, would prove important at the Mineirao. Dante's Bundesliga experience did little to help him against Germany on Tuesday. In the end, it counted for nothing. Dante and the rest of the Brazilian defence were given the run-around by a Germany side who seemed hell-bent on redefining the word ruthless. As the goals rattled in, cameras cut to Thiago sitting in the stands and watching through his fingers. How he must have wished he could have been out there to steady his teammates. It would be wrong to lay all the blame at Dante's door. This, after all, was a rout mapped out by the metronomic midfield passing triangles upon which Germany's recent success has been built. With Scolari electing to start Bernard instead of Paulinho, Toni Kroos, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Sami Khedira had the run of the midfield and poured forward at will. Luiz Gustavo and Fernandinho were outnumbered and overwhelmed. It was notable, however, that Germany had so much joy down Brazil's left. Thomas Muller slipped into the space between Dante and Marcelo time and again, swapped passes with the oppressively tidy Philipp Lahm and ghosted into the area unchecked. He was an itch the Selecao just could not scratch. On the other flank, Maicon, preferred to Dani Alves once again, had a touch more joy against Mesut Ozil -- but only a touch. There are no defensive heroes in a 7-1 defeat, after all. Brazil 1-7 Germany -- reaction - Marcotti: Scolari at a loss to explain - Jones: Seven stages of grief for Brazil - Duarte: Haunting defeat for the Selecao - Delaney: Three Points - Brazil broken by Germany - Low: German plan worked perfectly - Behind the Numbers: Germany's historic win - Photo Gallery: Best of Brazil vs. Germany - Klose breaks World Cup goals record | Highlight - Social reaction: Brazil, did that just happen? Scolari admitted after the game that Brazil had lost their bearings during that staggering first-half salvo. "I couldn't change anything ... it was one goal after another," the former Chelsea manager said. "There was nothing to be done during that breakdown." Luiz, who entered the field looking steely and left it in floods of tears, was perhaps the most culpable of all Brazil's defenders, having lost Muller for the opener and tried too hard to make amends thereafter. "I want to say sorry to all Brazilians," he sniffed after the final whistle. "It's a day of great sadness, the end of a dream." Really, though, it was more brutal than that -- a nightmare, perhaps. This was a night when Brazil's defence crumbled and, with it, their hopes of lifting the World Cup.	sports

Strikers making way for playmakers - ESPN FC	Time is running out for Miroslav Klose. It's precious and of the essence to him. At 36, the Germany striker is playing in his final World Cup. Every game has threatened to be his last since the knockout stage began. Tuesday's semifinal match against Brazil in Belo Horizonte is no different. Klose is hoping to have a place in the starting XI for his fourth consecutive World Cup semifinal. So far in this World Cup, he's made cameo appearances as a substitute and one start, playing only 135 minutes overall. Klose's aim upon making the squad was to score two goals in Brazil. The veteran Lazio forward has managed only one, sliding in at the far post to equalise against Ghana in the group stage. That strike meant Klose matched Ronaldo on 15 goals as the all-time leading scorer in World Cup history. Imagine if Klose were to break the record against Brazil. Wouldn't that be something? If the moment comes, he will have to seize it. And besides, Klose should perhaps consider himself lucky to be in the Germany squad at all. He is the only nominal centre-forward Low decided to take. Germany's talent distribution, after all, is disproportionately in or between the lines of midfield and attack. Still, the prevailing sensation from this World Cup is that it has been hard on the orthodox striker in general. That might sound foolish considering 2.8 goals per game were scored during the group stages. Were centre-forwards not among them? Didn't they take advantage? Not as much as you'd think. Of the players classified as more or less typical No. 9s, only Karim Benzema (even though he wears No. 10), Robin van Persie (a self-proclaimed 9 and a half), Wilfried Bony, Mario Mandzukic, Jackson Martinez, Clint Dempsey, Asamoah Gyan, Islam Slimani and Enner Valencia scored two or more goals. Miroslav Klose needs just one more goal to break Ronaldo's record as the World Cup's all-time record goal scorer. It's perhaps a surprise considering that some countries came into the World Cup with frightening firepower. Argentina looked top-heavy, as did Colombia in spite of Radamel Falcao's injury-enforced absence, while Uruguay's strike partnership of Edinson Cavani and Luis Suarez is about to become the most expensive in aggregated transfer fees (although they played together for only 178 minutes on account of Suarez's recovery from knee surgery and then his bite on Giorgio Chiellini).

Angel Di Maria injury Argentina - ESPN FC	Angel Di Maria has played a crucial role in helping Argentina reach the semifinals and his absence is a setback for La Albiceleste. In years to come, we might well remember Lionel Messi's pass to Ángel Di María during the first half of Argentina vs. Belgium as one of the best in World Cup history. I suspect, however, that most will be less quick to remember what happened next; a cut inside and a shot from Di María which resulted in him pulling up. Minutes later he had to be substituted and the following day Argentina's head doctor Daniel Martínez confirmed he'll miss Wednesday's semifinal against Netherlands. Di María's technical and tactical abilities are important for Argentina, of course, but they're arguably secondary and tertiary, in some ways, to the one thing that sets him aside from almost every other player in the world: the ability to run, run, run some more and then keep running long after everyone else has stopped. - McIntyre: Robben vs. Messi -- Stars collide - Top Tenner: World Cup semifinals So how will Argentina be affected by not having their Duracell bunny in midfield? There are a couple of possibilities and at the time of writing it's not clear which Alejandro Sabella is going to use. The first is that Argentina stick to the rough 4-4-2 they employed against Belgium, with Ezequiel Lavezzi on the left of midfield, bringing a replacement in on the right. That might be Benfica midfielder Enzo Pérez -- the tactically versatile utility man who had an excellent season just gone as a defensive midfielder but can also play further forward -- or it could be former Liverpool winger Maxi Rodríguez. Pérez replaced Di María against Belgium but of course by the time that happened Argentina were already a goal up, so whether Sabella will go with him from the start if the 4-4-2 is the system of choice isn't clear. All the same, the Benfica player seems to be the favourite at present to start on the right. That could change, however, if Sabella decides that the best way to counter the threat of the Dutch attack is a return to the 5-3-2 used in the opening match against Bosnia-Herzegovina. Marcos Rojo seems set to return from suspension at left back whatever, so the back five would see José Basanta move into the middle and Ezequiel Lavezzi dropped from left midfield to accommodate Rojo; Rojo and Basanta would thus be charged with doubling up on Arjen Robben on the Dutch right. If that strategy is used, it seems most likely that Argentina's midfield three would consist (from right to left) of Pérez, Javier Mascherano and Lucas Biglia. That seems uninspiring, but crucially it has a lot more balance to it than the midfield three used so poorly in the Bosnia-Herzegovina match; Maxi Rodríguez played on the right in that trio (with Mascherano and Di María), and hared up the pitch every time Argentina won the ball back, leaving Mascherano with no-one to give it to. Clearly, however Argentina line up they'll be weaker for Di María's exclusion. Whether he's played well or not, his running has provided a spark from midfield to complement Lionel Messi's iron will and nerves of steel which have defined Argentina's tournament so far. Without Di María, adaptation will be essential for Argentina's survival. On Wednesday, we'll learn a lot about just how versatile this side really are.	sports

Superstars collide in Messi vs. Robben - ESPN FC	SAO PAULO -- The eyes of 200 million Brazilians will be turned to the short-handed hosts' do-or-die match against Germany on Tuesday in Belo Horizonte. But it's this World Cup's other marquee semifinal -- between Argentina and the Netherlands -- that will showcase the top two remaining players in the tournament in Lionel Messi and Arjen Robben. That might not have been the case even if Selecao icon Neymar hadn't been forced to withdraw from the competition with a broken back. His injury, which has sent the already-fatalistic outlook of the locals toward even greater depths, came in Friday's win against a Colombia squad led by James Rodriguez, whose six goals lead the competition. Now, it's all about the two leading men in Wednesday's match when it comes to individual supremacy. That opportunity will be in front of them when they face off at Arena Corinthians. The Dutch and Albiceleste are mediocre teams led by exceptional singular talents. Usually, those squads get found out early. Not here, though. Part of the reason Brazil 2014 has been the most entertaining Cup in recent memory is that no team has truly distinguished itself. That means one brilliant individual performance could make the difference. It means there's a good chance that whoever performs better, Robben or Messi, could determine which side advances to Sunday's grand finale in Rio. Most of the attention will be on Messi, of course. The two biggest stars remaining in the World Cup -- Argentina's Lionel Messi and the Netherlands' Arjen Robben -- face off Wednesday. What's at stake for the tiny genius isn't lost on anyone. A World Cup win -- on Brazilian soil, no less -- would be the Albicleleste's first in 28 years, when Argentine deity Diego Maradona carried another decidedly average squad, quite literally single-handedly, to the title. Messi and Maradona are compared everywhere but in their shared homeland, which Messi left as a child and for which he has never been able to duplicate his exploits for club side Barcelona. Victory here may be the best chance he'll ever have of changing that, and it would also cement his legacy as one of the sport's true greats. But first, he'll have to get through the Oranje. And in what's guaranteed to be a tight game -- both teams have prioritized defense in the knockout rounds -- it could come down to one special moment. Odds are against this match being a classic, unlike their epic quarterfinal meeting in 1998. "Argentina was just stopping and slamming on the brakes," was Netherlands coach Louis van Gaal's assessment of the Albiceleste's 1-0 quarterfinal victory over Belgium. Getting Ready For Argentina vs. Netherlands: - McIntyre: Argentina's defense rising to occasion - Delaney: Old foes reunite in Argentina vs. Netherlands - McIntyre: Superstars collide in Messi vs. Robben - Cox: Four teams, four key battles - Marcotti: Previewing the World Cup semifinals - World Cup Power Rankings: Germany on top - Ames: Gamesmanship alive and well Meantime, the Dutch have found it difficult to score, managing just one goal from the run of play in two elimination games. Robben, though, was their best player in both. The Bayern Munich star's embellishment -- and the furor surrounding it -- has overshadowed that somewhat. Costa Rica's only answer for him on Saturday was to hack him down every time he got loose on the right wing. He tired to sell those fouls, sure, but fouls they were. With the ball at his feet, Robben has been the most dangerous player in the tournament so far, and he's finished three chances himself -- just one fewer than Messi. His leadership has also been crucial for the Dutch. "If players say something, that hits home much more than if I do," van Gaal said when asked about Robben's spirited address to his teammates before extra time commenced against the Ticos. Van Gaal praised the camaraderie of this team, a lack of which has famously torpedoed previous Dutch squads. There is a sense that this group is mentally tougher than its predecessors; Saturday's match marked the first time they'd won an extra-time match on the global stage in five tries. That bodes well for them on Wednesday. So does the improving form of playmaker Wesley Sneijder and the expected absence of injured Argentine midfielder Angel Di Maria. Still, not much separates these squads, and Argentina remains the slight odds (3-2) favorite. In the end, expect Robben or Messi to decide the outcome.

Carlos Bianchi the logical candidates are in the semifinals - ESPN FC	BUENOS AIRES -- A few days ago, before the round of 16, I started to write a column saying that the logical semifinals would be Germany-Brazil and Argentina-Holland. But I thought it was very probable that there would be surprises, given that there was not a huge difference between those four teams and those they were up against. In the end there were no surprises, although a few teams came close: Switzerland took Argentina all the way, Brazil had to wait for penalties to knock Chile out, and Holland did the same against Costa Rica. There were several moments in those games where one small incident (the goalpost, a poor finish, a refereeing mistake) was the difference between the winner and the loser. That does not mean that the four semifinalists are not there on merit. Theu were, no doubt, the ones who had the upper hand and always offered more than their opponents. It is no coincidence that they have history and are used to these situations, and in the long run they made that experience count. It is true, though, that not one of the four looked comfortable. They were never far ahead, either on the scoreboard or on the field. Everyone knows that they were better and they deserve to be where they are, but at the same time everyone knows they are in debt. Indeed, that explains why all four are practically equal candidates: They each have something that makes them dare to dream of winning the Cup, but at the same time they also have some problem that might leave them by the wayside. Germany-Brazil Of the four left standing, Germany is the only team that has not had to withstand so much pressure. It also seems to be the only one that has its whole squad fit without any significant absentee. The injuries to Neymar, Angel Di María and Nigel De Jong will certainly have an impact on how the Brazilian, Argentine and Dutch teams respectively perform. Germany lost only Reuss before the tournament, but today it has all its players fit, or at least so it appears. We will soon see if, at some point, they will pay the physical price of having paid so many midday games (three of five) in hot places, as well as the tiring journeys over practically the whole country (Manaus, Salvador, Recife, Porto Alegre and Río de Janeiro, as well as Belo Horizonte on Tuesday). With not many natural forwards, the Germans have found a way to create enough chances anyway. Against France, if they had been more clinical in the final third, the difference would have been bigger. For now, Germany's buildup play is far better than their finishing. Brazil vs. Germany: Tuesday, 4 ET, 9 BST (ESPN and WatchESPN) - Marcotti: Titans collide in the semifinals - Honigstein: Bierhoff's technological focus - Torre: Scolari lightens the mood - Brewin: Battered Brazil vs. vulnerable Germany - Smith: Jogo bonito the exception, not the rule - 50-50 Challenge: Brazil vs. Germany - Duarte: Brazil move past star absences - Cox: Brazil and Germany's role reversal Brazil's defense, which will also be missing their captain Thiago Silva, suspended after another yellow card, doesn't look the best prepared to stop that superpopulated midfield, which can get through on goal anywhere in different ways. If Germany improves its finishing, it has a big chance of getting through to the final in the Maracanã. Germany has, as I see it, two problems: The first is that its defense doesn't instil confidence. Ghana exposed it, and France could have if they had gone for it instead of choosing to lose with dignity. But the big problem for the Germans is that they are playing against the hosts. We still don't know how much that support will add to a Brazil team that is not overendowed in any department and is missing its captain and its star, but there is no doubt that Felipe Scolari's men will take the field with the desire to beat the Europeans just as they did the Colombians. In general, Brazil's first-half performances have been good, with a lot of energy, but as the time has passed that intensity has decreased. David Luiz has been, up to now, the standard-bearer with his displays and his aggressiveness, and the fans applaud that as if they were also aware of the limitations of a team that is not at the level required by its tradition, at least when it comes to playing good football. Indeed, what is missing from Brazil is football: They do not have creativity in midfield or up front, Hulk gives everything but he is a goal-scorer by trade and Fred so far has not justified his inclusion. Now without Neymar, it is difficult to see who will supply the goals the Barcelona player did and how. We will see how they set up for the game on Tuesday. It will be interesting to see what happens after the first goal, particularly if that goal is scored by Germany and the hosts have to come out and chase the game. Argentina-Netherlands Paradoxically, Holland was the team that created the most chances against their opponents in the 90 minutes, but the only team taken to extra time and penalties. Between the woodwork and Keylor Navas, Costa Rica survived 120 minutes before falling in the penalties. Arjen Robben still makes the difference, but Robin van Persie missed chances, and so the game got more difficult for the Netherlands. Without De Jong, we will have to see how they set up to defend against a team like Argentina, which asks more questions of them both through their attitude and individual abilities. We will have to wait as well to see how much more attacking Argentina will do, knowing that they don't want to be left at the mercy of a team set up for the counterattack like Louis van Gaal's Holland. Getting Ready For Argentina vs. Netherlands: - McIntyre: Argentina's defense rising to occasion - Delaney: Old foes reunite in Argentina vs. Netherlands - McIntyre: Superstars collide in Messi vs. Robben - Cox: Four teams, four key battles - Marcotti: Previewing the World Cup semifinals - World Cup Power Rankings: Germany on top - Ames: Gamesmanship alive and well Against Belgium, the match was opened up very early for Alejandro Sabella's men, thanks to Gonzalo Higuain's excellent technique that resulted in a goal. But against the Netherlands, if the match remains scoreless, it is much more likely that the teams will study each other and, returning to boxing metaphors, neither one will be looking to land the knockout blow knowing it might leave them open to being knocked down themselves. Argentina also looked more defensively solid in the round of 16. It is strange to think they might turn their back on what was so difficult to achieve in search of a more attacking formation that would leave them exposed against the speed of Robben and co. Robin van Persie and Lionel Messi take center stage in the Netherlands-Argentina semifinal. Anyhow, I still think that Argentina is, within the existing parity, the team with the biggest advantage, the best forwards. It is true that they have lost Di Maria, who today is the player who makes the biggest difference after Lionel Messi. It is also true that Sergio Aguero is not 100 percent fit and that Higuain only made his appearance in the fifth game. But in spite of all that, they still have strength in depth and attacking options. As well as having a certain Messi, of course. In such closed games, I repeat that it is those players who have the goal etched between their eyes who should make those small but decisive differences. Finally, I was surprised that Belgium manager Marc Wilmots said that Argentina had not impressed him and that they are a run-of-the-mill team. It would be good to know what his team did to make a better impression in the 82 minutes they had to turn the game around. Just like France, they gave the feeling that they settled for losing by a small margin, when at this stage of the tournament, it is better to take a risk and go all-in, since any defeat is simply that -- a farewell. It's anybody's tournament In short, all four semifinalists could be champions. Not one has clearly dominated, all have won by the smallest margin. Those players who have made a difference, not by coincidence are the tournament's top scorers, yet have left their mark with fleeting appearances, like Messi, Muller, Neymar or even Robben. It is a shame that a World Cup that started with so much excitement should have gradually been deflating, but it is understandable given the great parity in world football. At this point, when each game is all or nothing, do not expect to see anybody taking too many risks. Much less with the heat and the times of the matches, which oblige teams to ration their energy. Once more, it is sure to be certain players at specific moments who make the difference.

Carlos Bianchi the logical candidates are in the semifinals - ESPN FC	BUENOS AIRES -- A few days ago, before the round of 16, I started to write a column saying that the logical semifinals would be Germany-Brazil and Argentina-Holland. But I thought it was very probable that there would be surprises, given that there was not a huge difference between those four teams and those they were up against. In the end there were no surprises, although a few teams came close: Switzerland took Argentina all the way, Brazil had to wait for penalties to knock Chile out, and Holland did the same against Costa Rica. There were several moments in those games where one small incident (the goalpost, a poor finish, a refereeing mistake) was the difference between the winner and the loser. That does not mean that the four semifinalists are not there on merit. Theu were, no doubt, the ones who had the upper hand and always offered more than their opponents. It is no coincidence that they have history and are used to these situations, and in the long run they made that experience count. It is true, though, that not one of the four looked comfortable. They were never far ahead, either on the scoreboard or on the field. Everyone knows that they were better and they deserve to be where they are, but at the same time everyone knows they are in debt. Indeed, that explains why all four are practically equal candidates: They each have something that makes them dare to dream of winning the Cup, but at the same time they also have some problem that might leave them by the wayside.

Small margins for Argentina and Netherlands at the World Cup - ESPN FC	Memories of 1978's final and Dennis Bergkamp's goal at France in 1998 flooded back as soon as Netherlands and Argentina were paired for Sao Paulo's semifinal World Cup match. Both might have a sense of owing the other one. The Dutch's progress to this stage would seem a shock when considering that many thought they would struggle to get out of Group B. But since a 5-1 devastation of Spain, they have held themselves together, and despite slackening off from the fireworks of Salvador, have negotiated two troublesome assignments in Mexico and Costa Rica. Netherlands vs. Argentina: July 9, 4 ET (ESPN and WatchESPN) - Stats: Diego Maradona vs. Lionel Messi - McIntyre: Superstars collide in Messi vs. Robben - Brewin: Van Gaal's management style - Brassell: Semifinalists have much to lose - Honigstein: Kuyt an unsung hero for the Dutch - Cox: Key semifinal matchups - Marcotti: Then there were four at the World Cup - Five Aside: Dutch, Argentina look to overcome past There is, however, the possibility that the Dutch trajectory -- they do seem a little weary -- may be going in the opposite direction to Argentina, whose victory over Belgium was collected with ease. This time Lionel Messi was not the match winner, though -- as expected -- his movements made the whole thing possible. GOALKEEPER This has suddenly become an area of increased interest. Jasper Cillessen has done just fine in normal play for the Dutch, only to be replaced by Tim Krul as Louis van Gaal introduced his version of the baseball "closer." This was Krul's big moment and he grasped it with both hands, going the right way each time a Costa Rican took his kick. The likelihood is that Cillessen will return to his normal job. Or else, Van Gaal is even more ruthless than we thought. Sergio Romero, meanwhile, may well be the lesser goalkeeper left in the tournament, with due nod to Julio Cesar. He has not completely convinced in Brazil, though his showing as Iran piled on the pressure in a group-stage match was as much a match-winner as Messi proved. Still, he has the full faith of Alejandro Sabella, just as he had when Diego Maradona was coach in 2010. Edge: Netherlands Although subbed off for the penalty shoot-out against Costa Rica, Jasper Cillessen is expected to start for the Netherlands in the semifinal. DEFENCE Premier League fans may not be able to believe it, but the injury worry against Ron Vlaar may prove crucial. The Aston Villa stopper has been a relative rock amid a defence that has never looked truly solid. His experience would be missed in Arena Corinthians as the rest of the bunch are callow and far rawer. As ever with Dutch teams, the players are expected to be versatile, and "LVG" may either try a four- or three-man defence. More surprise for Premier League followers: Martin Demichelis' addition made Argentina look more solid than they had for their previous four matches. He is likely to keep his place ahead of Federico Fernandez, while Marcos Rojo, back from suspension, should replace Jose Basanta, who did well enough in Brasilia. Much still depends on the leadership of Ezequiel Garay, and the dedication of Pablo Zabaleta. Edge: Argentina Marcos Rojo, left, and Ezequiel Garay, right, will be relied upon to keep the formidable Dutch attack quiet. MIDFIELDERS The Dutch midfield is all about providing a platform for the three main men to perform, which is not too different from Argentina's approach. Daley Blind, versatile enough to play both defence and midfield, plays as the holder in the absence of Nigel De Jong and he, Georginio Wijnaldum and the redoubtable Dirk Kuyt, who played at left-back against Chile, do the work for Wesley Sneijder to try and create. The absence of Angel di Maria would clearly be a hindrance to Argentina. It is the Real Madrid speedster's running that has been the best counterpoint to Messi. Without him, Argentina's midfield looks like a collection of holders, and without pace. Enzo Perez did fine against the Belgians but the Dutch may increase the need for a greater dynamism. Edge: Netherlands The versatility of Daley Blind has been pivotal for Louis van Gaal. FORWARDS Robin van Persie has slowed down from the brilliance of his performance on the first Friday of the tournament. A series of tough visits to some hot locations around Brazil has not helped him return to the sharpness he showed back then. It has left a considerable burden on Arjen Robben, a leading contender for player of the tournament, but under which this flying Dutchman has flourished. He is certain to be key in Sao Paulo. Lionel Messi, then. We know all about him, but can he be stopped? It may end up being the leading question of World Cup 2014. The Dutch cause may not have been helped by Gonzalo Higuain finally locating his scoring touch in Brasilia, though a loose second-half finish suggested that he is not yet totally deadly. Sergio Aguero is likely to come from the bench, though Sabella suggested on Sunday he has made an "excellent" recovery from his latest muscle problem. Edge: Argentina Sergio Aguero's return from injury could prove timely for Argentina. RESERVES Van Gaal is not blessed with riches beyond his first-team selections, though he has made use of most of his squad -- even the reserve goalie, of course. He has been well served by his subs so far, in fact, with Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scoring the match-winning penalty against Mexico after replacing Van Persie. Sergio Aguero might prove to be a high-grade super-sub for Sabella in Sao Paulo. Sabella has options in attack and midfield with the likes of Rodrigo Palacio, Maxi Rodriguez and Ricky Alvarez. Few of them provide a true variation from what Sabella chooses to start with, though Palacio's switch to midfield against Switzerland did produce Di Maria's winning goal. Edge: Argentina Alejandro Sabella may have to rely on his bench to get Argentina over the line on Wednesday. COACHES Van Gaal is happy to assume credit for his team's successes so far, but then again he probably deserves it, too. No coach in the tournament has shown off such a varied set of formations and tactics, and few are willing to take on such tough calls like those Huntelaar and Krul introductions. Sabella is a strange cove given to talking deep philosophical doggerel in his news conferences. He clearly feels the deep pressure that an expectant nation places on him. Last week he complained that too many back home think his team should win. His furrowed brow is usually on show, as it was when he performed that falling-back exasperation at a Higuain miss that became an instant Vine hit. He has done well in getting Argentina to the semis for the first time since 1990, but looks as if he needs a long holiday. Edge: Netherlands Louis van Gaal cuts an imposing figure both in the dressing room and on the sidelines. INTANGIBLES Both these countries have had, over the years, the ability to come apart at the seams at the wrong time. Sao Paulo may see one of them -- or possibly both -- do just that. There is a sense that the Dutch have hit their target while Argentina and Messi in particular think the World Cup is on. A blue and white backing to the tune of Creedence Clearwater Revival is sure to be heard as the noisy neighbours descend on Brazil's biggest city. PREDICTION Argentina victory, with Messi at the centre. A predictable prediction, perhaps.	sports

Argentina 2-0 Belgium, 1986 It's a nice story to say that Diego Maradona won the World Cup on his own in 1986, but he of course had plenty of help -- their defence was strong, conceding only three goals before the final, while Jorge Valdano scored four goals and there were plenty of other top-drawer players in that team. That said, Maradona's performance that year was utterly extraordinary and is defined by two absurdly brilliant goals, the first the slaloming effort in the quarterfinal against England, the second another solo strike against Belgium in the semifinal, in which he picked up the ball 35 yards out and burst through a space that looked impossible to negotiate and smashed the ball home. In truth, this was a relatively routine victory for Argentina (as routine as a World Cup semifinal can be), but it displayed one of the greatest players the world has ever seen at the very peak of his powers, so for that reason alone deserves a place on this list. At His Peak: Maradona slaloms through the Belgian defence. 9. England 2-1 Portugal, 1966 The finest moment in English football history very nearly didn't happen -- or at least wouldn't have done if Eusebio had managed to complete an unlikely comeback in the semifinal. Bobby Charlton gave England the lead after half an hour, then doubled it with 10 minutes remaining, and Alf Ramsey's men began half-celebrating a place in the final. However, Eusebio scored a penalty a couple of minutes later, and a late onslaught very nearly took the game away from the English, but they managed to hold on thanks to some fine saves by Gordon Banks. Unlike England's bad-tempered win over Argentina in the quarterfinal, this was a game conducted in an atmosphere of mutual respect, so much so that Portuguese coach Otto Gloria congratulated the English after the game and correctly predicted they would win the final. "England plays football as it should be played. Germany relies on force," he said. 8. England 1-1 West Germany (West Germany won 4-3 on penalties), 1990 "It's the one thing, looking back, that I've got a tinge of disappointment about," Gary Lineker said a few years ago about the 1990 semifinal. "We were on the brink of getting to the final, and I think if we had got there, we would have been strong favourites. I had this conversation with him [Bobby Robson] once or twice. I remember the frustration, getting that close." This was of course more than just a single game in the story of English football, but a turning point in the rehabilitation of the sport after the stigmatised 1980s, and it perhaps says something about the English psyche that it took glorious failure to connect with the public at large. There were more than enough moments that those estranged from the game could identify with, from Lineker telling Robson to keep tabs on Paul Gascoigne after the yellow card that would put him out of the final, to the tears of Stuart Pearce and Chris Waddle. It was, of course, also a very exciting game, with Waddle inches away from putting England through without penalties, his extra-time shot crashing against the post. But for Lineker, Waddle, Pearce, Gascoigne and Robson, it will always be the great 'what if.' Paul Gascoigne, left, is consoled by teammate Steve McMahon after their semifinal penalty defeat. 7. Uruguay 6-1 Yugoslavia, 1930 Before the World Cup, the only real international football tournament was the Olympics, and in the years prior to 1930, Uruguay were the dominant force. They won the gold medal in 1924 and 1928, taking Yugoslavia apart on their way to the former, thrashing them 7-0, and they almost repeated the feat on a bigger stage in 1930. Yugoslavia actually took a surprise lead through Dorde Vujadinovic, but Uruguay quickly struck back through Pedro Cea then Peregrimo Anselmo, to go 2-1 up. However, the Yugoslavs were then the victim of some 'questionable' refereeing, as Brazilian official Gilberto de Almeida Rego firstly denied them a goal by an offside flag that we shall simply say 'could have gone either way,' then Uruguay scored a goal after the ball went out of play only to be put straight back in by a watching policeman. Uruguay went on to run away with the match, Cea scoring another couple to complete his hat trick, and, of course, went on to lift the first World Cup with a victory over Argentina in the final. 6. Germany 0-2 Italy, 2006 Winning the 2006 World Cup was a matter of hope rather than expectation for Germany. Sure, they had made the final in 2002, but they had limped out of the 2004 European Championships at the first-round stage without winning a game, and the brilliant generation of players who currently populate the side had yet to come through. Still, they made it to the semifinal, where they played Italy in a throbbing Westfalenstadion in Dortmund, and 118 minutes of goalless tension meant that penalties seemed inevitable. Then, Fabio Grosso, of all people, swept in a remarkable deadlock-breaker, before Alessandro del Piero, appearing as if from nowhere on a counter-attack as Germany desperately looked for an equaliser, finished it off. "I am drunk with joy," said Grosso after the game. "I haven't got much to say only that it is a victory for a strong group of people." Fabio Grosso, right, celebrates his unlikely match winner against World Cup hosts Germany. 5. Brazil 4-2 Chile, 1962 The 1962 World Cup was one of remarkable violence, of course most famously in the game between Chile and Italy in the first round. However, it would permeate the whole tournament, and not least in the semifinal between the hosts and the defending champions, when Chile tried to kick Garrincha, Brazil's star in the absence of the injured Pele and their player of the tournament, out of the game. That didn't work, but it did succeed in riling the bow-legged genius so much that after 83 minutes of fouls, he finally snapped and booted Chile midfielder Eladio Rojas in the stomach, for which he was, of course, sent off. Brazil launched a rather optimistic appeal on the basis that Garrincha had been goaded by the crowd, and remarkably it worked, and he was allowed to play in the final. Garrincha had given Brazil the lead with two first-half goals, Chile pulled one back through Jorge Toro, before a couple from Vava sealed the victory despite one more comeback attempt through a goal by Leonel Sanchez. 4. Hungary 4-2 Uruguay 1954 The progress of Hungary in the 1954 World Cup is often painted as a breeze all the way until the final, where they were defeated by West Germany in the 'miracle of Bern,' but that isn't quite the case. For a start, they were without Ferenc Puskas for the quarter and semifinal, after he was hobbled by a rake to his Achilles in the group game against the Germans. In the semifinal against defending champions Uruguay, Zoltan Czibor and Nandor Hidegkuti put them ahead, and it looked like they would cruise through to the final until Juan Hohberg scored in the 75th and 86th minutes to level things. So excited and exhausted was Hohberg that he fainted after the second strike and had to be revived by the attendant first-aiders. The game went to extra-time, where Sandor Koscis bagged two quick goals, and this time the Magyars held on and made the final, where most expected them to lift the trophy, only for one of the most extraordinary upsets in World Cup history to deny them. Sandor Kocsis celebrates as the ball rolls past Uruguayan goalkeeper Gaston Roque Maspoli into the net. 3. Brazil 5-2 France, 1958 Pele nearly didn't make it to the 1958 World Cup, a knee injury putting his selection in serious doubt until his teammates insisted on him travelling to Sweden. He didn't play in the first two games and appeared but didn't score in the third before netting the winner in Brazil's quarterfinal victory over Wales. However, he truly announced his arrival in the semifinal against France, scoring a second-half hat trick to give Brazil an emphatic 5-2 victory and a place in the final, where Pele would cement his status as the newest superstar in world football. It takes something for a player to eclipse another who scored 13 goals at a World Cup, but 1958 will always be known as Pele's tournament, not Just Fontaine's. 2. West Germany 3-3 France (West Germany win 5-4 on penalties), 1982 This game is, of course, best remembered for Harald Schumacher's assault on Patrick Battiston, and while football always likes a bogeyman to point at and scorn, it is rather a shame that the rest of the match isn't remembered quite so fondly, for it was a corker. "That was my most beautiful game," said Michel Platini, which from a man who won five league titles, the European Cup and the European Championships, is quite a statement. "What happened in those two hours encapsulated all the sentiments of life itself. No film or play could ever recapture so many contradictions and emotions. It was complete. So strong. It was fabulous." Pierre Litbarski gave the Germans the lead after 18 minutes, but shortly after Platini equalised from the penalty spot, and that's how it stayed until full time. France then looked like they had the game in the bag after extra-time goals by Marius Tresor and Alain Giresse, only for Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Karl Fischer with a bicycle kick to level things. The teams missed one penalty apiece in the initial five in the shootout, before Schumacher, who of course should not have been on the pitch, saved from Didier Six, and the Germans were in the final. West German goalkeeper Harald Schumacher, right, jumps past the ball as he gets ready to collide with French defender Patrick Battiston. 1. West Germany 3-4 Italy, 1970 Many will argue that this is the greatest World Cup match full stop, never mind the best semifinal; indeed, so astonishing was it that to this day there remains a plaque commemorating the occasion outside the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City. Roberto Boninsegna put the Italians ahead early on, and utilising their brilliant and sometimes brutal defence, led by Giacinto Facchetti, they tried to shut up shop, holding on until the final minute when Karl-Heinz Schnellinger equalised for the Germans. Gerd Muller then scored four minutes into extra time, then Italy took the lead through Tarcisio Burgnich and Gigi Riva, before Muller scored again, only for Gianni Rivera to score the winner just a minute later. Of course, Franz Beckenbauer dislocated his shoulder in the second half, but because the Germans had already made both permitted substitutions, he had to play on, arm strapped across his chest like a striding, 6-foot Napoleon. The Italians would go on to put up only half a fight in the final, losing 4-1 to Brazil, the stuffing, energy and spirit knocked out of them by this most bruising of encounters.	sports

Tim Vickery explores if Alejandro Sabella is an artist or artisan - ESPN FC	For years, Argentine football was defined by a battle for its soul between two rival schools of thought. There was that of Cesar Luis Menotti, a left-leaning intellectual, coach of the team who won the World Cup in 1978, who saw football as art. In the other corner was the camp of Carlos Bilardo, a World Cup-winning coach in 1986, for whom football is war and winning is the only objective. Curiously, Alejandro Sabella's 2014 team might be seen as straddling both sides, with an identity that incorporates bits of both, lurching back and forth between the two. Sabella was thrown in the deep end in 2011, appointed just before the start of the World Cup qualifiers and given an obvious mission -- get the best out of Lionel Messi, the little genius who had consistently failed to show his club form for his country. The new coach got off to a sticky start. Argentina had been beaten by Venezuela and held at home by Bolivia. They were then losing away to Colombia until Sergio Aguero was introduced at the interval and, together with Messi, turned the game around. Sabella found himself inching toward a 4-3-3 formation, with Messi operating behind two strikers, Aguero and Gonzalo Higuain. Behind Messi, there was a midfield trio, made up of three players with very different functions. Javier Mascherano protected the fort, Fernando Gago passed the ball (usually to Messi) and Angel Di Maria provided left-footed attacking thrust. There was an obvious similarity here with Menotti's 1978 side. True, then there was no Messi, and the attacking trio was totally different -- a centre-forward and two wingers rather than a pair of genuine strikers and a false nine/playmaker. But there was a striking similarity about the midfield three; 36 years ago Americo Gallego was the tough little tackler who rarely crossed the halfway line, Osvaldo Ardiles knitted the team together with his high-tempo passing, and Mario Kempes was the left-footed "matador," a constant threat with his attacking runs from deep. Netherlands vs. Argentina: July 9, 4 ET (ESPN and WatchESPN) - Stats: Diego Maradona vs. Lionel Messi - McIntyre: Superstars collide in Messi vs. Robben - Brewin: Van Gaal's management style - Brassell: Semifinalists have much to lose - Honigstein: Kuyt an unsung hero for the Dutch - Cox: Key semifinal matchups - Marcotti: Then there were four at the World Cup - Five Aside: Dutch, Argentina look to overcome past There was always a feeling that Sabella was concerned that the 4-3-3 formation left his team too open. "There are times when the opposition are attacking," he commented last year, "when all I can do is shut my eyes and pray." Argentina's coach seemed to lose his nerve when he arrived in Brazil. For the opening game against Bosnia he went with an ultra-cautious system with three centre-backs. It was a disaster, and after a dismal first 45 minutes he was obliged to revert to 4-3-3 at halftime. After the match Messi made it clear that this was his preferred way of playing, and that seemed to have settled the matter. But never underestimate the importance of what former British Prime Minister Harold MacMillan once referred to as "events, dear boy." In this case, the events were injuries to a couple of key members of the team. Aguero, who had never looked 100 percent, limped off in the third game against Nigeria and has yet to return -- though he could come off the bench in the semifinal against the Dutch. And then, in the quarterfinal against Belgium, Di Maria was a casualty. He will certainly miss the match against Holland. Alejandro Sabella's team lurches back and forth between being both creative and combative. Aguero was replaced by Ezequiel Lavezzi. This may have appeared a like-for-like switch, one striker for another. In reality, it was a big change. Aguero is a penalty-box predator, Lavezzi a winger. The new man patrolled the flank, and was happy to track back into midfield. In effect, Argentina were now playing 4-4-2, with Messi and Higuain up front and Lavezzi and Di Maria on the flanks, frequently swapping wings. The loss of Di Maria tends to emphasise this change further. The most likely scenario is one in which Enzo Perez starts the match against Holland -- he did well after coming on for Di Maria on Saturday. Perez is a player of considerable dynamism, but there is no doubt that his inclusion further tilts the balance of the midfield toward defence. Suddenly, we are a long way from the open 4-3-3, which Messi enjoys so much. In fact, we are moving closer to the Bilardo formula of 1986. This is not an exact comparison; Bilardo was a pioneer of the three-centre-back system, while Sabella's team still look more likely to take the field in Sao Paulo with a back four. But there is a similarity in the basic idea: keep compact, have numbers behind the ball and trust in the flashes of inspiration from a genius at No. 10, Diego Maradona in 1986, and Lionel Messi 26 years later.

Tim Vickery explores if Alejandro Sabella is an artist or artisan - ESPN FC	For years, Argentine football was defined by a battle for its soul between two rival schools of thought. There was that of Cesar Luis Menotti, a left-leaning intellectual, coach of the team who won the World Cup in 1978, who saw football as art. In the other corner was the camp of Carlos Bilardo, a World Cup-winning coach in 1986, for whom football is war and winning is the only objective. Curiously, Alejandro Sabella's 2014 team might be seen as straddling both sides, with an identity that incorporates bits of both, lurching back and forth between the two. Sabella was thrown in the deep end in 2011, appointed just before the start of the World Cup qualifiers and given an obvious mission -- get the best out of Lionel Messi, the little genius who had consistently failed to show his club form for his country. The new coach got off to a sticky start. Argentina had been beaten by Venezuela and held at home by Bolivia. They were then losing away to Colombia until Sergio Aguero was introduced at the interval and, together with Messi, turned the game around. Sabella found himself inching toward a 4-3-3 formation, with Messi operating behind two strikers, Aguero and Gonzalo Higuain. Behind Messi, there was a midfield trio, made up of three players with very different functions. Javier Mascherano protected the fort, Fernando Gago passed the ball (usually to Messi) and Angel Di Maria provided left-footed attacking thrust. There was an obvious similarity here with Menotti's 1978 side. True, then there was no Messi, and the attacking trio was totally different -- a centre-forward and two wingers rather than a pair of genuine strikers and a false nine/playmaker. But there was a striking similarity about the midfield three; 36 years ago Americo Gallego was the tough little tackler who rarely crossed the halfway line, Osvaldo Ardiles knitted the team together with his high-tempo passing, and Mario Kempes was the left-footed "matador," a constant threat with his attacking runs from deep. Netherlands vs. Argentina: July 9, 4 ET (ESPN and WatchESPN) - Stats: Diego Maradona vs. Lionel Messi - McIntyre: Superstars collide in Messi vs. Robben - Brewin: Van Gaal's management style - Brassell: Semifinalists have much to lose - Honigstein: Kuyt an unsung hero for the Dutch - Cox: Key semifinal matchups - Marcotti: Then there were four at the World Cup - Five Aside: Dutch, Argentina look to overcome past There was always a feeling that Sabella was concerned that the 4-3-3 formation left his team too open. "There are times when the opposition are attacking," he commented last year, "when all I can do is shut my eyes and pray." Argentina's coach seemed to lose his nerve when he arrived in Brazil. For the opening game against Bosnia he went with an ultra-cautious system with three centre-backs. It was a disaster, and after a dismal first 45 minutes he was obliged to revert to 4-3-3 at halftime. After the match Messi made it clear that this was his preferred way of playing, and that seemed to have settled the matter. But never underestimate the importance of what former British Prime Minister Harold MacMillan once referred to as "events, dear boy." In this case, the events were injuries to a couple of key members of the team. Aguero, who had never looked 100 percent, limped off in the third game against Nigeria and has yet to return -- though he could come off the bench in the semifinal against the Dutch. And then, in the quarterfinal against Belgium, Di Maria was a casualty. He will certainly miss the match against Holland. Alejandro Sabella's team lurches back and forth between being both creative and combative. Aguero was replaced by Ezequiel Lavezzi. This may have appeared a like-for-like switch, one striker for another. In reality, it was a big change. Aguero is a penalty-box predator, Lavezzi a winger. The new man patrolled the flank, and was happy to track back into midfield. In effect, Argentina were now playing 4-4-2, with Messi and Higuain up front and Lavezzi and Di Maria on the flanks, frequently swapping wings. The loss of Di Maria tends to emphasise this change further. The most likely scenario is one in which Enzo Perez starts the match against Holland -- he did well after coming on for Di Maria on Saturday. Perez is a player of considerable dynamism, but there is no doubt that his inclusion further tilts the balance of the midfield toward defence. Suddenly, we are a long way from the open 4-3-3, which Messi enjoys so much. In fact, we are moving closer to the Bilardo formula of 1986.

Raphael Honigstein pays tribute to Dirk Kuyt, the unsung hero of the Netherlands' World Cup campaign. - ESPN FC	On Sunday night, half a dozen members of the Netherlands squad were having a few quiet drinks at a Rio de Janeiro rooftop bar. Their press officer was with them, so this was obviously happening with the blessing of Louis van Gaal, who can be very strict about these things. (It didn't look as if anyone had any alcohol.) A regular at the bar told us that the Dutch, who had been staying in a nearby hotel on Ipanema beach until Monday (they hadn't been able to book the rooms for longer), had come quite often to escape the confines of their rooms and chill a bit. So far, so unremarkable. That's just the sort of thing the Dutch do. But there was something interesting about this group. All the players were wearing dark tops, and some also had baseball caps, with the overall effect that they almost disappeared into the darkness. The only Dutchman who wasn't at all concerned with keeping a low profile was Dirk Kuyt. The 33-year-old wore a white and orange training jacket, and his blond locks were visible from the distance. Maybe, at his age, he's simply past caring. Or maybe he actually enjoyed a bit of attention during what promises to be his last tournament. Kuyt, it's fair to say, has played a surprisingly big role in the Oranje's progress to the semifinals. He's been a starter in their past three games and should feature again against Argentina on Wednesday. Dirk Kuyt's versatility and commitment have been priceless for the Dutch this summer. The Fenerbahce striker has never been the sort of forward that the Dutch truly appreciate. His game is based on effort, endurance and positional intelligence. As a centre-forward, he's always had better players ahead of him and on the flanks; various coaches have preferred true wingers. Kuyt has been a different sort of specialist: a defensive wide forward. At club level, Rafael Benítez used him most effectively in that hybrid role during his time at Liverpool (2006-12) -- "Mr Duracell," the Spaniard used to call him. Under Marco van Basten, Kuyt played very well on the right in a counterattacking 4-2-3-1 Dutch side at Euro 2008. At the World Cup in South Africa two years later, his work rate contributed, as Bert van Marwijk's well-organised but largely uninspiring side made it to the final. His involvement in Poland/Ukraine 2012, where internal rifts and poor performances resulted in an early exit, only amounted to 12 minutes in two substitute appearances. Few expected the veteran from Katwijk aan Zee, a small city on the North Sea coast, to see so much action in Brazil, but perhaps we should have known something was up after one of the training sessions before the opening game against Spain. Van Gaal had requisitioned Kuyt from the reserves to train with the first-team forwards in Estadio da Gavea -- as a defender. Arjen Robben, Wesley Sneijder, Robin van Persie and a couple of others always outnumbered a two-, three- and four-man defence marshalled by Kuyt as the main centre-back, but they hardly got behind them to score any goals. Kuyt's men were too well positioned. The Dutch media later reported that since May van Gaal had been practising with the former Feyenoord man in various defensive positions. It's easier to list the positions he hasn't played at this World Cup. Apart from goalkeeper and the centre of defence, Kuyt has featured everywhere on the pitch for van Gaal. Against Mexico in the round of 16, Kuyt was used in four different roles by the 62-year-old coach. "He is fantastic; he is ready for everything, from the first to the last second," Kuyt said about van Gaal after the penalty win over Costa Rica. Super-sub Krul inspires Netherlands - Macintosh: Van Gaal has gumption to spare - Van Gaal planned Tim Krul switch all along - McIntyre: Van Gaal's gamble pays dividends - Van Gaal: We could have easily lost - Krul makes the difference in penalties - Dream come true for keeper Tim Krul All those frequent tactical changes are only possible because in Kuyt, the future Man United manager has a player who will selflessly do any task asked of him, and he will do it with maximum effort. "Robben might be the star, Sneijder might be the tragic hero who has sacrificed himself ... but the symbol of this team is Dirk Kuyt," said Johan Cruyff, the high priest of Oranje, who never had too much time for hard workers in the past. "You are blessed with someone like Kuyt. You can go everywhere with him, tactically." The son of a fisherman -- Kuyt himself worked on the trawlers as a teenager before starting his career at Utrecht -- represents the more pragmatic, physical Rotterdam style, but he has ironically become the last link to the old idea of Total Football, too. Dutch footballers were supposed to play in any position and interchange frequently, according to the 1970s textbook, but Cruyff et al never had good, honest runners such as Kuyt in mind. Yet the former Barcelona coach seems to have relaxed his criteria in line with the changed mood in the Netherlands. "They have given up on the way of football we developed," the 67-year-old said. "But something has come in the place of that creativity and dominance. And it works. It is direct and effective, and it is built on passion and team spirit." The actual football is being played by the three guys further up the pitch. Kuyt's importance, however, cannot be underestimated. Not only is his ultra-professional attitude exemplary, but he also helps the dressing room with his sunny and endearingly positive disposition. It's telling that van Gaal appointed him vice-captain when he took over; Kuyt continued in this role despite getting little playing time in the World Cup qualifiers. Kuyt's importance, stamina and versatility cannot be underestimated. On the occasion of his 100th cap for the Netherlands, the round of 16 clash with Mexico, van Persie presented Kuyt with a little gift and gave a short speech. Kuyt became only the seventh "centurion" in the history of the KNVB (Royal Dutch Football Association), and the day coincided with the seventh anniversary of his father's death, too. "I knew that my father would have been proud, but not just for me -- for all the players and the staff," he said. That might not have been the last emotional, historic day for the second-oldest player (behind Germany's Miroslav Klose) left in the competition. "We have a lot of quality, and we will show it to Argentina." Having come this far, Mr. Duracell is not about to slow down now.

Small margins for Argentina and Netherlands at the World Cup - ESPN FC	Memories of 1978's final and Dennis Bergkamp's goal at France in 1998 flooded back as soon as Netherlands and Argentina were paired for Sao Paulo's semifinal World Cup match. Both might have a sense of owing the other one. The Dutch's progress to this stage would seem a shock when considering that many thought they would struggle to get out of Group B. But since a 5-1 devastation of Spain, they have held themselves together, and despite slackening off from the fireworks of Salvador, have negotiated two troublesome assignments in Mexico and Costa Rica. Netherlands vs. Argentina: July 9, 4 ET (ESPN and WatchESPN) - Stats: Diego Maradona vs. Lionel Messi - McIntyre: Superstars collide in Messi vs. Robben - Brewin: Van Gaal's management style - Brassell: Semifinalists have much to lose - Honigstein: Kuyt an unsung hero for the Dutch - Cox: Key semifinal matchups - Marcotti: Then there were four at the World Cup - Five Aside: Dutch, Argentina look to overcome past There is, however, the possibility that the Dutch trajectory -- they do seem a little weary -- may be going in the opposite direction to Argentina, whose victory over Belgium was collected with ease. This time Lionel Messi was not the match winner, though -- as expected -- his movements made the whole thing possible. GOALKEEPER This has suddenly become an area of increased interest. Jasper Cillessen has done just fine in normal play for the Dutch, only to be replaced by Tim Krul as Louis van Gaal introduced his version of the baseball "closer." This was Krul's big moment and he grasped it with both hands, going the right way each time a Costa Rican took his kick. The likelihood is that Cillessen will return to his normal job. Or else, Van Gaal is even more ruthless than we thought. Sergio Romero, meanwhile, may well be the lesser goalkeeper left in the tournament, with due nod to Julio Cesar. He has not completely convinced in Brazil, though his showing as Iran piled on the pressure in a group-stage match was as much a match-winner as Messi proved. Still, he has the full faith of Alejandro Sabella, just as he had when Diego Maradona was coach in 2010. Edge: Netherlands Although subbed off for the penalty shoot-out against Costa Rica, Jasper Cillessen is expected to start for the Netherlands in the semifinal. DEFENCE Premier League fans may not be able to believe it, but the injury worry against Ron Vlaar may prove crucial. The Aston Villa stopper has been a relative rock amid a defence that has never looked truly solid. His experience would be missed in Arena Corinthians as the rest of the bunch are callow and far rawer. As ever with Dutch teams, the players are expected to be versatile, and "LVG" may either try a four- or three-man defence. More surprise for Premier League followers: Martin Demichelis' addition made Argentina look more solid than they had for their previous four matches. He is likely to keep his place ahead of Federico Fernandez, while Marcos Rojo, back from suspension, should replace Jose Basanta, who did well enough in Brasilia. Much still depends on the leadership of Ezequiel Garay, and the dedication of Pablo Zabaleta. Edge: Argentina Marcos Rojo, left, and Ezequiel Garay, right, will be relied upon to keep the formidable Dutch attack quiet. MIDFIELDERS The Dutch midfield is all about providing a platform for the three main men to perform, which is not too different from Argentina's approach. Daley Blind, versatile enough to play both defence and midfield, plays as the holder in the absence of Nigel De Jong and he, Georginio Wijnaldum and the redoubtable Dirk Kuyt, who played at left-back against Chile, do the work for Wesley Sneijder to try and create. The absence of Angel di Maria would clearly be a hindrance to Argentina. It is the Real Madrid speedster's running that has been the best counterpoint to Messi. Without him, Argentina's midfield looks like a collection of holders, and without pace. Enzo Perez did fine against the Belgians but the Dutch may increase the need for a greater dynamism. Edge: Netherlands The versatility of Daley Blind has been pivotal for Louis van Gaal. FORWARDS Robin van Persie has slowed down from the brilliance of his performance on the first Friday of the tournament. A series of tough visits to some hot locations around Brazil has not helped him return to the sharpness he showed back then. It has left a considerable burden on Arjen Robben, a leading contender for player of the tournament, but under which this flying Dutchman has flourished. He is certain to be key in Sao Paulo. Lionel Messi, then. We know all about him, but can he be stopped? It may end up being the leading question of World Cup 2014. The Dutch cause may not have been helped by Gonzalo Higuain finally locating his scoring touch in Brasilia, though a loose second-half finish suggested that he is not yet totally deadly. Sergio Aguero is likely to come from the bench, though Sabella suggested on Sunday he has made an "excellent" recovery from his latest muscle problem. Edge: Argentina Sergio Aguero's return from injury could prove timely for Argentina. RESERVES Van Gaal is not blessed with riches beyond his first-team selections, though he has made use of most of his squad -- even the reserve goalie, of course. He has been well served by his subs so far, in fact, with Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scoring the match-winning penalty against Mexico after replacing Van Persie. Sergio Aguero might prove to be a high-grade super-sub for Sabella in Sao Paulo. Sabella has options in attack and midfield with the likes of Rodrigo Palacio, Maxi Rodriguez and Ricky Alvarez. Few of them provide a true variation from what Sabella chooses to start with, though Palacio's switch to midfield against Switzerland did produce Di Maria's winning goal. Edge: Argentina Alejandro Sabella may have to rely on his bench to get Argentina over the line on Wednesday. COACHES Van Gaal is happy to assume credit for his team's successes so far, but then again he probably deserves it, too. No coach in the tournament has shown off such a varied set of formations and tactics, and few are willing to take on such tough calls like those Huntelaar and Krul introductions. Sabella is a strange cove given to talking deep philosophical doggerel in his news conferences. He clearly feels the deep pressure that an expectant nation places on him. Last week he complained that too many back home think his team should win. His furrowed brow is usually on show, as it was when he performed that falling-back exasperation at a Higuain miss that became an instant Vine hit. He has done well in getting Argentina to the semis for the first time since 1990, but looks as if he needs a long holiday. Edge: Netherlands Louis van Gaal cuts an imposing figure both in the dressing room and on the sidelines. INTANGIBLES Both these countries have had, over the years, the ability to come apart at the seams at the wrong time. Sao Paulo may see one of them -- or possibly both -- do just that. There is a sense that the Dutch have hit their target while Argentina and Messi in particular think the World Cup is on. A blue and white backing to the tune of Creedence Clearwater Revival is sure to be heard as the noisy neighbours descend on Brazil's biggest city. PREDICTION Argentina victory, with Messi at the centre. A predictable prediction, perhaps.	sports

Top Ten World Cup Semifinals - ESPN FC	With the World Cup in Brazil now at the semifinal stage, we look at 10 of the greatest semifinals from down the years. 10. Argentina 2-0 Belgium, 1986 It's a nice story to say that Diego Maradona won the World Cup on his own in 1986, but he of course had plenty of help -- their defence was strong, conceding only three goals before the final, while Jorge Valdano scored four goals and there were plenty of other top-drawer players in that team. That said, Maradona's performance that year was utterly extraordinary and is defined by two absurdly brilliant goals, the first the slaloming effort in the quarterfinal against England, the second another solo strike against Belgium in the semifinal, in which he picked up the ball 35 yards out and burst through a space that looked impossible to negotiate and smashed the ball home. In truth, this was a relatively routine victory for Argentina (as routine as a World Cup semifinal can be), but it displayed one of the greatest players the world has ever seen at the very peak of his powers, so for that reason alone deserves a place on this list. At His Peak: Maradona slaloms through the Belgian defence. 9. England 2-1 Portugal, 1966 The finest moment in English football history very nearly didn't happen -- or at least wouldn't have done if Eusebio had managed to complete an unlikely comeback in the semifinal. Bobby Charlton gave England the lead after half an hour, then doubled it with 10 minutes remaining, and Alf Ramsey's men began half-celebrating a place in the final. However, Eusebio scored a penalty a couple of minutes later, and a late onslaught very nearly took the game away from the English, but they managed to hold on thanks to some fine saves by Gordon Banks. Unlike England's bad-tempered win over Argentina in the quarterfinal, this was a game conducted in an atmosphere of mutual respect, so much so that Portuguese coach Otto Gloria congratulated the English after the game and correctly predicted they would win the final. "England plays football as it should be played. Germany relies on force," he said. 8. England 1-1 West Germany (West Germany won 4-3 on penalties), 1990 "It's the one thing, looking back, that I've got a tinge of disappointment about," Gary Lineker said a few years ago about the 1990 semifinal. "We were on the brink of getting to the final, and I think if we had got there, we would have been strong favourites. I had this conversation with him [Bobby Robson] once or twice. I remember the frustration, getting that close." This was of course more than just a single game in the story of English football, but a turning point in the rehabilitation of the sport after the stigmatised 1980s, and it perhaps says something about the English psyche that it took glorious failure to connect with the public at large. There were more than enough moments that those estranged from the game could identify with, from Lineker telling Robson to keep tabs on Paul Gascoigne after the yellow card that would put him out of the final, to the tears of Stuart Pearce and Chris Waddle. It was, of course, also a very exciting game, with Waddle inches away from putting England through without penalties, his extra-time shot crashing against the post. But for Lineker, Waddle, Pearce, Gascoigne and Robson, it will always be the great 'what if.' Paul Gascoigne, left, is consoled by teammate Steve McMahon after their semifinal penalty defeat. 7. Uruguay 6-1 Yugoslavia, 1930 Before the World Cup, the only real international football tournament was the Olympics, and in the years prior to 1930, Uruguay were the dominant force. They won the gold medal in 1924 and 1928, taking Yugoslavia apart on their way to the former, thrashing them 7-0, and they almost repeated the feat on a bigger stage in 1930. Yugoslavia actually took a surprise lead through Dorde Vujadinovic, but Uruguay quickly struck back through Pedro Cea then Peregrimo Anselmo, to go 2-1 up. However, the Yugoslavs were then the victim of some 'questionable' refereeing, as Brazilian official Gilberto de Almeida Rego firstly denied them a goal by an offside flag that we shall simply say 'could have gone either way,' then Uruguay scored a goal after the ball went out of play only to be put straight back in by a watching policeman. Uruguay went on to run away with the match, Cea scoring another couple to complete his hat trick, and, of course, went on to lift the first World Cup with a victory over Argentina in the final. 6. Germany 0-2 Italy, 2006 Winning the 2006 World Cup was a matter of hope rather than expectation for Germany. Sure, they had made the final in 2002, but they had limped out of the 2004 European Championships at the first-round stage without winning a game, and the brilliant generation of players who currently populate the side had yet to come through. Still, they made it to the semifinal, where they played Italy in a throbbing Westfalenstadion in Dortmund, and 118 minutes of goalless tension meant that penalties seemed inevitable. Then, Fabio Grosso, of all people, swept in a remarkable deadlock-breaker, before Alessandro del Piero, appearing as if from nowhere on a counter-attack as Germany desperately looked for an equaliser, finished it off. "I am drunk with joy," said Grosso after the game. "I haven't got much to say only that it is a victory for a strong group of people." Fabio Grosso, right, celebrates his unlikely match winner against World Cup hosts Germany. 5. Brazil 4-2 Chile, 1962 The 1962 World Cup was one of remarkable violence, of course most famously in the game between Chile and Italy in the first round. However, it would permeate the whole tournament, and not least in the semifinal between the hosts and the defending champions, when Chile tried to kick Garrincha, Brazil's star in the absence of the injured Pele and their player of the tournament, out of the game. That didn't work, but it did succeed in riling the bow-legged genius so much that after 83 minutes of fouls, he finally snapped and booted Chile midfielder Eladio Rojas in the stomach, for which he was, of course, sent off. Brazil launched a rather optimistic appeal on the basis that Garrincha had been goaded by the crowd, and remarkably it worked, and he was allowed to play in the final. Garrincha had given Brazil the lead with two first-half goals, Chile pulled one back through Jorge Toro, before a couple from Vava sealed the victory despite one more comeback attempt through a goal by Leonel Sanchez. 4. Hungary 4-2 Uruguay 1954 The progress of Hungary in the 1954 World Cup is often painted as a breeze all the way until the final, where they were defeated by West Germany in the 'miracle of Bern,' but that isn't quite the case. For a start, they were without Ferenc Puskas for the quarter and semifinal, after he was hobbled by a rake to his Achilles in the group game against the Germans. In the semifinal against defending champions Uruguay, Zoltan Czibor and Nandor Hidegkuti put them ahead, and it looked like they would cruise through to the final until Juan Hohberg scored in the 75th and 86th minutes to level things. So excited and exhausted was Hohberg that he fainted after the second strike and had to be revived by the attendant first-aiders. The game went to extra-time, where Sandor Koscis bagged two quick goals, and this time the Magyars held on and made the final, where most expected them to lift the trophy, only for one of the most extraordinary upsets in World Cup history to deny them. Sandor Kocsis celebrates as the ball rolls past Uruguayan goalkeeper Gaston Roque Maspoli into the net. 3. Brazil 5-2 France, 1958 Pele nearly didn't make it to the 1958 World Cup, a knee injury putting his selection in serious doubt until his teammates insisted on him travelling to Sweden. He didn't play in the first two games and appeared but didn't score in the third before netting the winner in Brazil's quarterfinal victory over Wales. However, he truly announced his arrival in the semifinal against France, scoring a second-half hat trick to give Brazil an emphatic 5-2 victory and a place in the final, where Pele would cement his status as the newest superstar in world football. It takes something for a player to eclipse another who scored 13 goals at a World Cup, but 1958 will always be known as Pele's tournament, not Just Fontaine's. 2. West Germany 3-3 France (West Germany win 5-4 on penalties), 1982 This game is, of course, best remembered for Harald Schumacher's assault on Patrick Battiston, and while football always likes a bogeyman to point at and scorn, it is rather a shame that the rest of the match isn't remembered quite so fondly, for it was a corker. "That was my most beautiful game," said Michel Platini, which from a man who won five league titles, the European Cup and the European Championships, is quite a statement. "What happened in those two hours encapsulated all the sentiments of life itself. No film or play could ever recapture so many contradictions and emotions. It was complete. So strong. It was fabulous." Pierre Litbarski gave the Germans the lead after 18 minutes, but shortly after Platini equalised from the penalty spot, and that's how it stayed until full time. France then looked like they had the game in the bag after extra-time goals by Marius Tresor and Alain Giresse, only for Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Karl Fischer with a bicycle kick to level things. The teams missed one penalty apiece in the initial five in the shootout, before Schumacher, who of course should not have been on the pitch, saved from Didier Six, and the Germans were in the final. West German goalkeeper Harald Schumacher, right, jumps past the ball as he gets ready to collide with French defender Patrick Battiston. 1. West Germany 3-4 Italy, 1970 Many will argue that this is the greatest World Cup match full stop, never mind the best semifinal; indeed, so astonishing was it that to this day there remains a plaque commemorating the occasion outside the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City. Roberto Boninsegna put the Italians ahead early on, and utilising their brilliant and sometimes brutal defence, led by Giacinto Facchetti, they tried to shut up shop, holding on until the final minute when Karl-Heinz Schnellinger equalised for the Germans. Gerd Muller then scored four minutes into extra time, then Italy took the lead through Tarcisio Burgnich and Gigi Riva, before Muller scored again, only for Gianni Rivera to score the winner just a minute later. Of course, Franz Beckenbauer dislocated his shoulder in the second half, but because the Germans had already made both permitted substitutions, he had to play on, arm strapped across his chest like a striding, 6-foot Napoleon. The Italians would go on to put up only half a fight in the final, losing 4-1 to Brazil, the stuffing, energy and spirit knocked out of them by this most bruising of encounters.	sports
Small margins for Argentina and Netherlands at the World Cup - ESPN FC	Memories of 1978's final and Dennis Bergkamp's goal at France in 1998 flooded back as soon as Netherlands and Argentina were paired for Sao Paulo's semifinal World Cup match. Both might have a sense of owing the other one. The Dutch's progress to this stage would seem a shock when considering that many thought they would struggle to get out of Group B. But since a 5-1 devastation of Spain, they have held themselves together, and despite slackening off from the fireworks of Salvador, have negotiated two troublesome assignments in Mexico and Costa Rica. Netherlands vs. Argentina: July 9, 4 ET (ESPN and WatchESPN) - Stats: Diego Maradona vs. Lionel Messi - McIntyre: Superstars collide in Messi vs. Robben - Brewin: Van Gaal's management style - Brassell: Semifinalists have much to lose - Honigstein: Kuyt an unsung hero for the Dutch - Cox: Key semifinal matchups - Marcotti: Then there were four at the World Cup - Five Aside: Dutch, Argentina look to overcome past There is, however, the possibility that the Dutch trajectory -- they do seem a little weary -- may be going in the opposite direction to Argentina, whose victory over Belgium was collected with ease. This time Lionel Messi was not the match winner, though -- as expected -- his movements made the whole thing possible. GOALKEEPER This has suddenly become an area of increased interest. Jasper Cillessen has done just fine in normal play for the Dutch, only to be replaced by Tim Krul as Louis van Gaal introduced his version of the baseball "closer." This was Krul's big moment and he grasped it with both hands, going the right way each time a Costa Rican took his kick. The likelihood is that Cillessen will return to his normal job. Or else, Van Gaal is even more ruthless than we thought. Sergio Romero, meanwhile, may well be the lesser goalkeeper left in the tournament, with due nod to Julio Cesar. He has not completely convinced in Brazil, though his showing as Iran piled on the pressure in a group-stage match was as much a match-winner as Messi proved. Still, he has the full faith of Alejandro Sabella, just as he had when Diego Maradona was coach in 2010. Edge: Netherlands Although subbed off for the penalty shoot-out against Costa Rica, Jasper Cillessen is expected to start for the Netherlands in the semifinal. DEFENCE Premier League fans may not be able to believe it, but the injury worry against Ron Vlaar may prove crucial. The Aston Villa stopper has been a relative rock amid a defence that has never looked truly solid. His experience would be missed in Arena Corinthians as the rest of the bunch are callow and far rawer. As ever with Dutch teams, the players are expected to be versatile, and "LVG" may either try a four- or three-man defence. More surprise for Premier League followers: Martin Demichelis' addition made Argentina look more solid than they had for their previous four matches. He is likely to keep his place ahead of Federico Fernandez, while Marcos Rojo, back from suspension, should replace Jose Basanta, who did well enough in Brasilia. Much still depends on the leadership of Ezequiel Garay, and the dedication of Pablo Zabaleta. Edge: Argentina Marcos Rojo, left, and Ezequiel Garay, right, will be relied upon to keep the formidable Dutch attack quiet. MIDFIELDERS The Dutch midfield is all about providing a platform for the three main men to perform, which is not too different from Argentina's approach. Daley Blind, versatile enough to play both defence and midfield, plays as the holder in the absence of Nigel De Jong and he, Georginio Wijnaldum and the redoubtable Dirk Kuyt, who played at left-back against Chile, do the work for Wesley Sneijder to try and create. The absence of Angel di Maria would clearly be a hindrance to Argentina. It is the Real Madrid speedster's running that has been the best counterpoint to Messi. Without him, Argentina's midfield looks like a collection of holders, and without pace. Enzo Perez did fine against the Belgians but the Dutch may increase the need for a greater dynamism. Edge: Netherlands The versatility of Daley Blind has been pivotal for Louis van Gaal. FORWARDS Robin van Persie has slowed down from the brilliance of his performance on the first Friday of the tournament. A series of tough visits to some hot locations around Brazil has not helped him return to the sharpness he showed back then. It has left a considerable burden on Arjen Robben, a leading contender for player of the tournament, but under which this flying Dutchman has flourished. He is certain to be key in Sao Paulo. Lionel Messi, then. We know all about him, but can he be stopped? It may end up being the leading question of World Cup 2014. The Dutch cause may not have been helped by Gonzalo Higuain finally locating his scoring touch in Brasilia, though a loose second-half finish suggested that he is not yet totally deadly. Sergio Aguero is likely to come from the bench, though Sabella suggested on Sunday he has made an "excellent" recovery from his latest muscle problem. Edge: Argentina Sergio Aguero's return from injury could prove timely for Argentina. RESERVES Van Gaal is not blessed with riches beyond his first-team selections, though he has made use of most of his squad -- even the reserve goalie, of course. He has been well served by his subs so far, in fact, with Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scoring the match-winning penalty against Mexico after replacing Van Persie. Sergio Aguero might prove to be a high-grade super-sub for Sabella in Sao Paulo. Sabella has options in attack and midfield with the likes of Rodrigo Palacio, Maxi Rodriguez and Ricky Alvarez. Few of them provide a true variation from what Sabella chooses to start with, though Palacio's switch to midfield against Switzerland did produce Di Maria's winning goal. Edge: Argentina Alejandro Sabella may have to rely on his bench to get Argentina over the line on Wednesday. COACHES Van Gaal is happy to assume credit for his team's successes so far, but then again he probably deserves it, too. No coach in the tournament has shown off such a varied set of formations and tactics, and few are willing to take on such tough calls like those Huntelaar and Krul introductions. Sabella is a strange cove given to talking deep philosophical doggerel in his news conferences. He clearly feels the deep pressure that an expectant nation places on him. Last week he complained that too many back home think his team should win. His furrowed brow is usually on show, as it was when he performed that falling-back exasperation at a Higuain miss that became an instant Vine hit. He has done well in getting Argentina to the semis for the first time since 1990, but looks as if he needs a long holiday. Edge: Netherlands Louis van Gaal cuts an imposing figure both in the dressing room and on the sidelines. INTANGIBLES Both these countries have had, over the years, the ability to come apart at the seams at the wrong time. Sao Paulo may see one of them -- or possibly both -- do just that. There is a sense that the Dutch have hit their target while Argentina and Messi in particular think the World Cup is on. A blue and white backing to the tune of Creedence Clearwater Revival is sure to be heard as the noisy neighbours descend on Brazil's biggest city. PREDICTION Argentina victory, with Messi at the centre. A predictable prediction, perhaps.	sports
Alfredo Di Stefano: 1926-2014 - ESPN FC	Perhaps the best summary of the talent of Real Madrid legend Alfredo Di Stefano came from Brazilian star Didí when asked to compare the Argentine and Pelé, both of whom he played with: "Edson is Pelé 10 minutes per match; Alfredo is Di Stefano all 90 of them." When Di Stéfano arrived in Madrid in 1953, he was already a well-established player. At the age of 28, he had played and impressed in his native Argentina, where he had won the Championship with River Plate and the Copa America with the national team. But in 1949 a players' strike stopped the Argentinean Championship and most stars left for Colombia, including Di Stefano, loaned by River Plate to Millonarios de Bogota. There, Di Stefano won four titles in four years. In fact, the Blond Arrow and his teammates became as globally popular as it was possible to be back then, as the aptly nicknamed Ballet Azul (Blue Ballet) -- with Di Stefano, Nestor Rossi, Julio Cozzi and Adolfo Pedernera at its heart -- received constant invitations to play abroad. One of those trips, in 1952, took them to the Bernabeu for Real Madrid's 50th anniversary tournament; Millonarios demolished the hosts 4-2 and it was then that Real president Santiago Bernabeu fell in love with Di Stefano for the first time. He was not the only one, though. Barcelona also wanted the Argentinean and, while Real Madrid courted Millonarios, the Catalans negotiated with the original owners of Di Stefano's rights: River Plate. Thus the most controversial signing in Spanish football history was born, and with it the best known rivalry in Spanish football. The debate continues nowadays as though no time had passed: both clubs still claim to be right. Each signed their respective contracts with Millonarios and River and, after months of arguments that left the player anxiously waiting in Barcelona, in September of 1953 the Spanish FA decided to have Di Stefano play one season for each team during four seasons, starting in the Les Corts -- the Camp Nou's predecessor. Shortly thereafter, in a move that still sparks conspiracy theories, Barcelona sold its rights over the player to Real Madrid. Di Stefano said several times that Barcelona lost interest in him after his first two matches with the Azulgrana showed the toll that six months of no real football had taken on his legs, but the real reasons for his move to Madrid may never be known. Once the chance of forging an amazing partnership with Ladislao Kubala in Barcelona was off the table, the Blond Arrow turned a mediocre Real Madrid, who had gone 20 years without winning a single title in Spain, into one of the best teams ever. He gave the club a crash course in winning, and completely changed its status in both Spanish and European football. In 11 seasons, Di Stefano and the Merengues won eight Liga titles, one Copa del Rey and five consecutive European Cups. He scored relentlessly -- won five scoring titles, reaching 307 goals in 403 matches -- and led by example with amazing dedication, playing every game with unprecedented intensity. On top of that, Di Stefano never restricted his work to the pitch, as he helped to select and hire a handful of players like Jose Emilio Santamaria or Hector Rial, who became instrumental in Real Madrid's decade of dominance. His continuous success with Real Madrid contrasts remarkably with his frustrating record with his two national teams. Argentina did not play the World Cups of 1950 and 1954 while Spain -- he had become a Spanish national in 1956 -- failed to qualify for 1958 and Di Stefano picked up an injury right before the 1962 World Cup (he made the trip to Chile, but did not play). He ended up scoring 23 goals in 31 matches for Spain, but never made the kind of impact he managed in domestic football with La Furia. Indeed, goals and titles with Real Madrid made him grow into a national celebrity in Spain, and he expanded his range of activities. Di Stefano became a pioneer in advertising among sportsmen, endorsing several brands and profiting enormously from it. He even took part in three movies -- Con los mismos colores (1949), Once pares de botas (1954), La batalla del domingo (1963) -- always in one of those "as himself" roles, as his popularity skyrocketed. There are many moments from his career which deserve to be remembered, but its pinnacle could well have happened at Hampden Park, where he scored a hat trick and dominated both offensively and defensively what has become widely considered the best match ever played: Real Madrid's 7-3 win over Eintracht Frankfurt in the 1960 European Cup final. Di Stefano never appeared at the World Cup during a wonderful career. As his physical decline started, the unforgiving president Santiago Bernabeu -- not that long ago his partner in the construction of a sports empire -- forced him to finish his career somewhere else, leaving the Madridistas angry at the treatment of their former idol. Di Stefano did end up playing his last two seasons in Barcelona, but for Espanyol. He retired at age 40, and quickly started to work as a coach; never as successful as his previous decades as a player, but with an impressive experience in any case. He managed nine clubs, including Real Madrid, twice; Valencia, three times; and amazingly enough both Argentine rivals Boca Juniors AND River Plate, whom he took to national titles. In 2000, current Real Madrid president Florentino Perez gave Di Stefano the title of President of Honour. The Argentinean became a de facto ambassador for Real Madrid, his first duty being the reception of FIFA's prize to the Best Club of the 20th Century, an award that could have not possibly happened without him. His titles, but especially his will to win -- a trait Real Madrid kept after he left -- transformed the club into the global powerhouse that it has become nowadays. Di Stefano's greatness can indeed be measured in the amazing amount of trophies he won, in the goals he scored season after season, but especially in the current size of the club he so decisively helped to build. He deserves to be considered one of the best ever; among the very exclusive list that contains the likes of Pele, Diego Maradona and Johan Cruyff.	sports
Di Stefano's lasting legacy in Madrid - ESPN FC	Real Madrid have no shortage of star names in their well-decorated history book, but in Alfredo Di Stefano, who died on Monday after suffering a heart attack, they enjoyed the services of one of the best footballers of all time. "Thank you, Alfredo Di Stefano," said Los Merengues' official website following the announcement of his death at the age of 88. "The best player of all time passes away." Players such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane, Luis Figo, Ronaldo and Raul are among the talent-packed players who have donned the club's famous all-white colours but Argentina-born Di Stefano, who was the club's honorary president, topped the lot. He didn't just shine in his 11 trophy-packed years in the Spanish capital, he helped shape the future of arguably the most famous football club in the world. Here are five reasons the Blond Arrow, as he was affectionately known, was the most important player in the club's history. Success breeds success His individual talent ranked alongside the best players that have ever played the beautiful game. Scoring 308 goals in 396 competitive games for Madrid, Di Stefano set the benchmark for those stars who were to follow in his footsteps. He became the first Real Madrid player to win the Ballon d'Or when he won football's greatest individual prize in 1957 and he added another two years later. To bag the award once is an honour, to do it twice takes a special talent, and the Argentine was certainly that. His artistry rubbed off on the rest of his teammates and he hauled in a huge amount of trophies. Five consecutive European Cups, eight La Liga titles, one Spanish Cup and one Intercontinental Cup were among the vast array of club honours he bagged while with Los Blancos. Alfredo Di Stefano in his third season with Real Madrid. He played, shone and led Madrid's finest period in the club's history and set a winning mentality that continues to this day. Madrid were the leading light during the Blond Arrow's days, something they strive for now more than ever. Di Stefano set that winning mentality firmly in motion. His success has helped breed the success his club enjoy to this day. The start of Madrid's European obsession The European Cup has been an obsession for Madrid and Di Stefano played a key role in ensuring the trophy has become the most sought-after for Los Blancos. The Argentine scored the first goal as Madrid lifted the trophy for the first time in 1956 and it was a crucial strike. His team were 2-0 down against Stade de Reims inside 10 minutes before he scored the goal that got Madrid back into the game and eventually helped them to a thrilling 4-3 success in Paris. Di Stefano scored in each of Madrid's five European Cup final triumphs between 1956 and 1960. The five-star victories ensured Madrid were the team to beat in European competition and that continues to this day. It was therefore fitting that he was able to witness Los Merengues secure their long-awaited La Decima in Lisbon in May. The start of the Galacticos Di Stefano is often recognised as Madrid's first Galactico and can be credited with current president Florentino Perez's obsession with bringing in the best players on the planet. The Argentine was one of the first off-the-pitch stars, as well as shining on the pitch, with a number of appearances on the silver screen as well as being the star attraction during Madrid's golden era. He was big business for the club outside of football, a trend that continues more than ever today. - Carter: Revisiting Di Stefano's move to Madrid - Vickery: Di Stefano South America's greatest His talents caught the attention of Perez, then only a supporter during the Argentine's playing days, and Madrid's president brought his former idol on board at the Bernabeu in the capacity as honorary president during his first term in charge in 2000. That star attraction rubbed off on Perez, who has ensured he brings in a Galactico most of the seasons he's been in charge at the Bernabeu. Zidane, Figo, Ronaldo and David Beckham have led the way. Stars for the club not only on the pitch, but off it, too. Perez and Di Stefano have always been at the side of the new additions when unveiled to the press. El Clasico personified The Blond Arrow has left a huge footprint on Real Madrid but it could so easily have been in Catalonia as Spain's old foes battled it out for his signature. He first caught the attention of Madrid, and then-president Santiago Bernabeu, during a friendly in Madrid when playing for his Colombian club Millonarios, shining in a 4-2 victory for the visitors. It prompted Bernabeu to approach the club for his services to bring him to the Spanish capital, but the deal was not to prove straightforward. Barcelona were also interested and made an approach to the Colombians, as well as his parent club River Plate in Argentina. River accepted the deal but Millonarios did not due to Barca's approach to the deal. Eventually, however, Di Stefano was seemingly heading to Barcelona in 1953 but the Spanish federation refused to ratify the deal because both River and Millonarios could not agree on the deal. FIFA left the decision to the Spanish federation and they set up a deal that would allow the player to play for four seasons in the country -- two with Barca and two with Madrid. Eventually, Di Stefano would manage Madrid on two separate occasions. It was a deal that did not suit Barca and the player ended up in Madrid. It could so easily have been different and it could so easily have been the Blaugrana celebrating his success, and not Los Blancos. Post-playing-day presence Unsurprisingly, Madrid ensured Di Stefano continued to play a key role at Madrid when he retired as a player, although it was not imminent as then-president Bernabeu allowed his departure to Barcelona, albeit Espanyol. Believing the forward's time at the top was over, Bernabeu infuriated many Madrid fans by letting their star man leave the club, but he was sure to return. He came back as manager and played a key role in the emergence of the famous La Quinta del Buitre, led by Emilio Butragueno. His first stint came from 1982 to 1984 and he returned for a second short spell in 1990, his final season in the dugout. Although he won't be remembered for his management spells, the Argentine continued to be involved with the club, and in 2000 was named honorary president by Perez, lifting the Best Club of the 20th Century Trophy, awarded by FIFA. Valdebebas, Madrid's top-of-the-range training facility, also has its main stadium named after him with a statue outside. Madrid's second team, Real Madrid Castilla, play their home matches there, where he will continue to be remembered among Madrid fans and players young and old.	sports
Alfredo Di Stefano: South America's greatest footballer - ESPN FC	There is one question that a writer on South American football can never escape: Who was better, Pele or Diego Maradona? It is not a debate I usually enjoy. The two were obviously extraordinarily gifted players, who gave pleasure to millions and who belong to all humanity. Points can be made in favour of both, without any need for the tone to become adversarial. But all too often the discussion degenerates into an infantile nationalist slanging match. To avoid being involved, I have come out with a defence strategy. Question: Who is the greatest of all time, Pele or Maradona? Answer: Alfredo Di Stefano. Certainly it is hard to think of any player who proved more influential than Di Stefano. One of the last products of the golden age of Argentine football in the 1940s, he played a major role in getting the professional game in Colombia off the ground -- and then, 60 years ago, he embarked on a process that would transform the global game, and maybe even the political history of Europe. It was on September 23, 1953, that Di Stefano played his first game for Real Madrid, a friendly against Nancy of France. Real lost 4-2. Long-term, though, they were the big winners. Alfredo Di Stefano died on July 7, 2014 at the age of 88. A couple of years later, the European Cup was launched. We know it now as the Champions League, the foremost competition in the world, where reputations are made and where, according to the players, the standard of the game is highest. It is an unqualified success. But that was not an inevitable outcome. Back in 1955, when the thing got under way, it was a high-risk endeavour. It was only a decade since Europe had been at war. The process of reconstruction was not yet complete. England, for example, still had not completely eliminated rationing. Feelings of enmity and mistrust abounded. The English FA did not allow Chelsea to compete in the inaugural version. By 1960, when Real won their fifth consecutive European Cup with a famous 7-3 thrashing of Eintracht Frankfurt, it was a different story. The competition was already intrinsically linked with glamour and excitement -- much of that was down to Real, and in turn, much of that was down to Di Stefano. He was the conductor of the orchestra, the hub of everything the team sought to do. Bobby Charlton, then a young Manchester United reserve, will never forget the experience of watching Di Stefano from the stands in the 1957 semi-finals. "I thought 'Who is this man?' as he made his early impact on the game. 'He takes the ball from the goalkeeper; he tells the full-backs what to do; wherever he is on the field he is in a position to take the ball; you can see his influence on everything that is happening.' It was pure revelation. Everything seemed to radiate from him. I had never seen such a complete footballer. It was as though he had set up his own command centre at the heart of the game. He was as strong as he was subtle. The combination of qualities was mesmerising." Alfredo di Stefano (July 4, 1926 - July 7, 2014) • 308 goals in 11 seasons for Real Madrid. • Two-time Ballon d'Or winner (1957, 1959). • Eight La Liga titles, five European Cups with Madrid. • Scored 50 goals in 60 European Cup matches. • 31 international caps for Spain, scoring 23 goals. • Argentina born, he also played six times for the Albiceleste.  • Also played for River Plate, Millionarios (COL). Espanyol (ESP). • Coached eight teams, including Real Madrid and Valencia. • Real Madrid Castilla play at Alfredo di Stefano Stadium.   All around the continent football fans were going through the same epiphany. Everyone wanted to see Real Madrid. Everyone wanted to be Real Madrid. One of the first changes Don Revie made when he took over as manager of Leeds United was to change the club colours to all white, in honour of Di Stefano and his supporting cast. The quality of the spectacle they provided helped cement the European Cup as the pinnacle of the continent's club game -- it even jolted South America into starting an equivalent, the Copa Libertadores, so that its champion could go toe-to-toe with Europe's. The first winners of the new World Club trophy? Di Stefano's Real Madrid. Europe was changed forever. Some would even argue that the style and success of Real improved the image of Spain on the world stage -- the country was ruled at the time by the fascist dictator Francisco Franco -- and hastened the process by which the country became a mass tourist destination and went on to be reintegrated as a democracy into Western Europe. Others might say that this would be taking things too far. But the mere existence of the debate is testimony to the footballing genius of Alfredo Di Stefano, and his remarkable journey. After making his mark in his native Argentina and in Colombia, it was 60 years ago that he kicked off the most celebrated phase of a magnificent career.

Louis van Gaal a drastic change from David Moyes - ESPN FC	As the World Cup comes to its conclusion, next season's Premier League kickoff is just over five weeks away. Those who will find themselves covering Manchester United have a glint in their eye. This Louis van Gaal chap seems like he might provide some good stories win, draw or lose -- though especially lose. The Dutch master has carried himself as if he were the coach of the tournament. His public pronouncements are never slow in awarding himself credit. He has revealed himself to be no respecter of reputations, with the successful removals of Robin van Persie and Jasper Cillessen bringing in match winners for both the Netherlands' knockout matches. The Tim Krul introduction for the penalty shootout did a fine job of shrouding what had been a poor display against Costa Rica. The general who makes his own luck is a fine characteristic to call on in top-level coaching. At such a time, it is difficult not to draw comparisons with David Moyes, Van Gaal's hapless predecessor-to-be or "Poor David," as he became known to many in United circles. Van Gaal, brusque, self-assured and flamboyant, has looked in Brazil like everything Moyes could not be at Old Trafford. Moyes remains well-liked in football, except among those who helped bring about his fall in April. Plenty of goodwill is retained for him. He won much credit among the English press pack when showing up in Miami as the England squad prepared for its embarrassingly premature exit. Away from the glare of the postmatch flash interview or those uncomfortable news conferences that got shorter with each defeat, Moyes is a sociable, clubbable cove and won back the appreciation of those who became his tormentors during that disastrous nine months in charge. Louis van Gaal might not be the friendliest coach, but his management skills are top notch. One thing remains clear: Moyes was never a fit for United. On arrival, the place shrank him, one of British football's finest managers, and he never allowed himself to grow back. Van Gaal does not strike as a man to be so bowed, so humble. If the aim of the Glazer family's appointment is to reduce the residual influence of Sir Alex Ferguson, then such a dominant figure is necessary. Van Gaal has never been known to duck a challenge. Making returns to Barcelona, Ajax and the Dutch team suggests either reckless abandon or total self-assurance. Things did not work out at either club, but a return to the national team has provided vindication. Failing to get a generation containing Ruud van Nistelrooy, Patrick Kluivert, Clarence Seedorf and Edwin van der Sar to the 2002 World Cup was the biggest blot on his résumé, yet with a group of lesser talents, he has gone far beyond expectations in 2014. Like Moyes, Van Gaal is a tracksuit manager, but the evidence suggests that the results of their training ground work are very different. Moyes preached solidity, shape and linear football to players who refused to be converted. Van Gaal's Netherlands have played several different formations in five matches in Brazil, with adaptability, a tenet of "Total Football," at the heart of his dictations. Getting Ready For Argentina vs. Netherlands: - McIntyre: Argentina's defense rising to occasion - Delaney: Old foes reunite in Argentina vs. Netherlands - McIntyre: Superstars collide in Messi vs. Robben - Cox: Four teams, four key battles - Marcotti: Previewing the World Cup semifinals - World Cup Power Rankings: Germany on top - Ames: Gamesmanship alive and well The Netherlands' opening win against Spain will probably end up being the most devastating display of this entire World Cup. It was achieved through Van Gaal striking at the heart of Spain. Where others had previously sat back to be eventually lulled by Spain's possession game, the Dutch asked questions that the ailing holders could no longer answer. Van Persie and Arjen Robben in particular, players beyond their supposed peak years, performed as if given fresh footballing lives. Around them, their teammates always stuck to their coach's rigorous instructions; those United players whose interest dipped under Moyes will not get away with it now. "He is the brain behind everything," said Krul on Monday. "We know before each game what we have to do." In choosing to take on United after a World Cup, Van Gaal, hardly getting any younger at 62, placed great pressure on himself. Had the Dutch exited Group B, as many expected, then he faced arriving in Manchester as a lame duck. Now, no matter what might happen from this point on, he will arrive with his swagger fully justified, his blow-dried head held high. "I'm asking you, if you have such a clever question, if you're going to ask me questions, I'm going to ask you questions" is a sample of his World Cup news conferences. He has not joined Manchester United to make friends. Those expectant journalists are in for a far tougher ride from Van Gaal than they ever gave Moyes.	sports
Alfredo Di Stefano - a tribute - ESPN FC	Alfredo Di Stefano had the power to change a generation of young players. When I was a child, my mother used to take my sister and I to her parents' house every Thursday afternoon. My grandfather Joaquín, a lifelong Madridista and socio since time immemorial was a man of few words and borderline grumpy, but his face lit up when asked about his favourite topic: football. Mostly Real Madrid's golden age in the late 1950s, when the Merengues dominated the European Cup and Alfredo Di Stefano earned his legendary status in world football. Those like Joaquín, lucky enough to have watched Di Stefano play, never fail to touch upon two things: The first was his amazing talent around the ball. "He created new dribble, ways to strike the ball, and performed tricks I've never seen again, like the goal he scored with his backheel, jumping while facing the goal," he once told me. Carried away by his memories, my grandfather then tried to imitate the move -- something vaguely similar to Rene Higuita's signature scorpion kick -- pretending to hit the ball only with one leg. It was by no means the sort of exercise a 70-something-year-old should try, but Joaquín would go any length to impress his grandson and instil the Di Stefano creed in him. The second and probably most remarkable characteristic repeated by Di Stefano's legion of admirers refers to his ability to impact a match in endless ways, one tireless display after another. Despite wearing a very traditional number No. 9 shirt, he refused to occupy one specific position and preferred to roam around the pitch, choosing the areas where he could hurt most the opposition. "He took football from still photos to motion pictures," former Real Madrid player and fellow Argentinean Jorge Valdano once said. Alfredo di Stefano (July 4, 1926 - July 7, 2014) • 308 goals in 11 seasons for Real Madrid. • Two-time Ballon d'Or winner (1957, 1959). • Eight La Liga titles, five European Cups with Madrid. • Scored 50 goals in 60 European Cup matches. • 31 international caps for Spain, scoring 23 goals. • Argentina born, he also played six times for the Albiceleste.  • Also played for River Plate, Millionarios (COL). Espanyol (ESP). • Coached eight teams, including Real Madrid and Valencia. • Real Madrid Castilla play at Alfredo di Stefano Stadium. Don Joaquín mentioned Di Stefano's 'Total Football' approach [long before it had been coined as a term] often enough. My grandfather could spend hours talking about how la Saeta Rubia (the Blond Arrow) appeared omnipresent in the match and carried the side on his shoulders from the moment the ref first blew the whistle; he did so by taking control of the whole stadium as well as by imposing a work ethic that defined the profile of the type of player the Bernabeu still favours 60 years later: the one that, alongside their considerable talent, makes a point of showing effort and commitment in every play. Di Stefano's winning obsession took him to recommend players to be hired by President Bernabeu -- "I know a good player as soon as he steps on the pitch," the Blond Arrow stated in his autobiography "Gracias, vieja" (Thanks, old woman; in reference to the football). Indeed, he preferred to play with his own people as he was often accused of exerting a quite demanding type of leadership in the dressing room. "He was as nasty as they come with his teammates, because of his competitiveness," my grandfather used to say. "I remember a sequence of five matches at the Bernabeu during which he managed to yell at every single member of the team every match. All of them! A friend and I were keeping count. And the squad ended up winning every single one of those matches by a three-goal difference!" Joaquín's -- and most Madridistas' -- only regret regarding the Blond Arrow involved the national team. An Argentinean national during the World Cups of 1950 and 1954, he could not play in those two as his country of origin declined to participate. After he became a Spanish national in 1956, Spain failed to qualify for 1958, and then Di Stefano picked up an injury right before the 1962 World Cup (he made the trip to Chile, but did not play). "A shame, a complete shame. Terrible luck. Thank God I'll always have Hampden Park to remember": Joaquín remembered the epic 1960 European Cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt in Scotland almost every Thursday. Many believe that to be the best match ever played, and Di Stefano's complete domination of proceedings and his incredible hat trick, together with the final 7-3 scoreline, put him on the pantheon of greatest players ever. Di Stefano scores in the 1960 final against Eintracht Frankfurt. When he left to play for Espanyol in 1964, Joaquín could not forgive Santiago Bernabeu, saying: "We Madridistas don't know how to bid farewell to our idols." When Di Stefano moved into coaching, my grandfather followed his career closely, but a hint of disappointment when speaking about those years always showed: "He was never a Di Stefano of the bench, neither he enjoyed having players of his level at any of the clubs he coached". Sadly, when current Real Madrid president Florentino Perez declared Di Stéfano President of Honour in 2000, my grandfather had passed away a few years earlier. He never had the chance of seeing his idol occupy the place he deserved in the club's hierarchy. That said, I couldn't help an emotional moment six months ago, while reading Di Stefano's autobiography. At some point, remembering his favourite goals, Alfredo didn't hesitate: "The best? In my second season with Real Madrid I remember one I scored hitting the ball with my back heel, while I was in the air facing the goal." As I was reading these words I could picture my grandfather 30 years ago jumping on one foot to make his almost incomprehensible impression of the best goal he ever saw, the best one the Blond Arrow himself ever scored. And only then I completely understood how much those Thursdays with Don Joaquin fed my interest in football, and how important a man I never saw play live was for this passion of mine. Now that he's gone, Di Stefano's feats will stay alive in the stories one generation tells the next; inspiring newcomers to learn to love the game in the same way that one of its idols did so much.	sports
Superstars collide in Messi vs. Robben - ESPN FC	SAO PAULO -- The eyes of 200 million Brazilians will be turned to the short-handed hosts' do-or-die match against Germany on Tuesday in Belo Horizonte. But it's this World Cup's other marquee semifinal -- between Argentina and the Netherlands -- that will showcase the top two remaining players in the tournament in Lionel Messi and Arjen Robben. That might not have been the case even if Selecao icon Neymar hadn't been forced to withdraw from the competition with a broken back. His injury, which has sent the already-fatalistic outlook of the locals toward even greater depths, came in Friday's win against a Colombia squad led by James Rodriguez, whose six goals lead the competition. Now, it's all about the two leading men in Wednesday's match when it comes to individual supremacy. That opportunity will be in front of them when they face off at Arena Corinthians. The Dutch and Albiceleste are mediocre teams led by exceptional singular talents. Usually, those squads get found out early. Not here, though. Part of the reason Brazil 2014 has been the most entertaining Cup in recent memory is that no team has truly distinguished itself. That means one brilliant individual performance could make the difference. It means there's a good chance that whoever performs better, Robben or Messi, could determine which side advances to Sunday's grand finale in Rio. Most of the attention will be on Messi, of course. The two biggest stars remaining in the World Cup -- Argentina's Lionel Messi and the Netherlands' Arjen Robben -- face off Wednesday. What's at stake for the tiny genius isn't lost on anyone. A World Cup win -- on Brazilian soil, no less -- would be the Albicleleste's first in 28 years, when Argentine deity Diego Maradona carried another decidedly average squad, quite literally single-handedly, to the title. Messi and Maradona are compared everywhere but in their shared homeland, which Messi left as a child and for which he has never been able to duplicate his exploits for club side Barcelona. Victory here may be the best chance he'll ever have of changing that, and it would also cement his legacy as one of the sport's true greats. But first, he'll have to get through the Oranje. And in what's guaranteed to be a tight game -- both teams have prioritized defense in the knockout rounds -- it could come down to one special moment. Odds are against this match being a classic, unlike their epic quarterfinal meeting in 1998. "Argentina was just stopping and slamming on the brakes," was Netherlands coach Louis van Gaal's assessment of the Albiceleste's 1-0 quarterfinal victory over Belgium. Getting Ready For Argentina vs. Netherlands: - McIntyre: Argentina's defense rising to occasion - Delaney: Old foes reunite in Argentina vs. Netherlands - McIntyre: Superstars collide in Messi vs. Robben - Cox: Four teams, four key battles - Marcotti: Previewing the World Cup semifinals - World Cup Power Rankings: Germany on top - Ames: Gamesmanship alive and well Meantime, the Dutch have found it difficult to score, managing just one goal from the run of play in two elimination games. Robben, though, was their best player in both. The Bayern Munich star's embellishment -- and the furor surrounding it -- has overshadowed that somewhat. Costa Rica's only answer for him on Saturday was to hack him down every time he got loose on the right wing. He tired to sell those fouls, sure, but fouls they were. With the ball at his feet, Robben has been the most dangerous player in the tournament so far, and he's finished three chances himself -- just one fewer than Messi. His leadership has also been crucial for the Dutch. "If players say something, that hits home much more than if I do," van Gaal said when asked about Robben's spirited address to his teammates before extra time commenced against the Ticos. Van Gaal praised the camaraderie of this team, a lack of which has famously torpedoed previous Dutch squads. There is a sense that this group is mentally tougher than its predecessors; Saturday's match marked the first time they'd won an extra-time match on the global stage in five tries. That bodes well for them on Wednesday. So does the improving form of playmaker Wesley Sneijder and the expected absence of injured Argentine midfielder Angel Di Maria. Still, not much separates these squads, and Argentina remains the slight odds (3-2) favorite. In the end, expect Robben or Messi to decide the outcome.
