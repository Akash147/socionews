Football365 - Football News, Views, Gossip and much more...	We cannot imagine this will go down incredibly well with Wayne Rooney but it looks like he will be on the left tonight against Ecuador. "He can do that (role), absolutely," said Hodgson, who also confirmed that Frank Lampard would captain the side and James Milner would start at right-back. "I think Wayne's a very useful player in the sense you don't have to pin him down and say this is the only position he can play." The debate continues...	sports

The Afternoon Gossip | Football Transfer Rumours and Gossip | Football365	Barca plan Â£56m move for Aguero, City close to securing Â£15m Fernando, Arsenal target Morata to join Juve, and... Last Updated: 03/06/14 at 16:32 Post Comment Latest Articles Chelsea in pole position for Fabregas, Spurs target three defensive recruits, Bony to cost Arsenal Â£19m and more... Adam Lallana needs to put in a transfer request to force through Reds move, Balotelli to Arsenal and Cesc to City... All the rumours from Tuesday morning are here... BARCELONA PLOT AGUERO BID It looks like Barcelona won't take 'no' for an answer in their chase for Sergio Aguero. According to the Daily Star, the Catalan club are preparing a bid of Â£56m for the striker, who is also attracting interest from Real Madrid. Aguero's father told COPE radio that his son prefers a move to Barcelona last week, but added that Manchester City are unlikely to let him leave. The Star report: 'New Barcelona manager Luis Enrique has made the 26-year-old his No.1 summer target. 'Cesc Fabregas and Alexis Sanchez are set to leave Barcelona during the close season and Enrique wants to use the funds raised through their sales to finance a deal for Aguero.' FERNANDO SET FOR CITY Manchester City are close to sealing a Â£15m move for Porto midfielder Fernando, report the Daily Mirror. The 26-year-old was tipped for a deadline-day switch to the Etihad in February, but the transfer fell through at the eleventh hour. A deal for Fernando has now been resurrected, though, with City also chasing his teammate Eliaquim Mangala. MORATA WANTS JUVE MOVE After months of speculation linking Alvaro Morata with a move to Arsenal, it seems the Real Madrid forward is now on his way to Juventus. The Daily Express claim that Real are planning to use the 21-year-old as bait in their bid to bring Arturo Vidal to the Santiago Bernabeu. Apparently Carlo Ancelotti sees Vidal as the perfect replacement for the ageing Xabi Alonso, and is willing to let Morata go to secure a transfer. STOKE CLOSING ON DIOUF Stoke are closing in on their second signing of the summer after already completing a deal for Sunderland's Phil Bardsley. The next target on Mark Hughes' wish list is former Manchester United striker Mame Biram Diouf, who was close to joining the Potters last summer. Diouf has caught Hughes' eye after scoring 33 goals in 68 games for Hannover over the past two seasons and it's thought a transfer is close to completion. "We're hopeful that Diouf will be done," Stoke chairman Peter Coates told the BBC. AND THE REST Roberto Martinez has revealed that he has already identified who he wants to sign this summer, and is now working on closing several deals...Arsenal face competition for Toulouse right-back Serge Aurier after his agent said the Ivorian is currently in talks with another English club...Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United are all tracking highly-rated MK Dons youngster Dele Alli...Aleksandar Kolarov has emerged as a target for Bayern Munich...Michael Laudrup is planning to return to management with a 'big club'...and finally, there is a tremendous piece of bulls**t doing the rounds that Manchester United want Luis Suarez for Â£65m. Inventive.	sports

It's a cracking mailbox that also includes a very convoluted rating system... A lot of people think Wayne Rooney should not be playing at all. If he does play, the call is for a diamond formation. We have lots of World Cup mails so thanks... There are only ten days to go before the biggest event of the football calendar and yet we're still having to publish emails about Arsene Wenger.

Despite cruising to a 3-0 win against Peru, England didn't show a great deal to support Matt Stanger's view that they'll get out of the group. He's waiting to judge Wayne Rooney... It's unlikley Peru will provide a similar test to Uruguay simply because they are from the same confederation, but the most important thing for England is to avoid costly injuries...

Ashley Cole showing a genuine emotion, Kallstrom's last match and Newcastle fans actually wanting their club to be run in an ethical manner. These are heady times indeed... It was a performance that encapsulated everything that Mourinho stands for and desires. On a sunny morning in Liverpool, Jose came, he saw and he ruined the party... It's easy to criticise Mike Dean for another catalogue of errors, but he should really be congratulated for such an impressive display of winding-up Rui Faria and Chelsea. Liverpool got the 'fear' at times on Sunday, but Vincent Kompany was there to allow the little kid to carry on sprinting. The sort of mistake that wins or loses a title race...	sports

The Page That Is Planning More Treats | Football365 | Mediawatch	Latest Articles 'Man reminds other men to sing (even though there's no indication they've forgotten)' is the headline on several back pages while Daniel Sturridge has been 'forcing' Roy Hodgson to play him... Which journo has claimed an exclusive on the Lambert story despite citing The Guardian elsewhere? And Robbie Savage thinks that Tim Sherwood is more magic than Harry Potter... Wrong, Wrong, Wrong Ian Wright has launced a staunch defence of Danny Welbeck in The Sun as he struggles to grasp why some fans don't want to see the forward in England's first XI. 'People are constantly having a pop at him but there's not a lot of foundation to that beyond the fact United had such a nightmare season,' writes Wright. 'Of course, he might miss a couple of chances here and there...' A couple of chances, Ian? Only 13 goals in 77 appearances for United over the last two seasons suggests he's missed a lot more than that. Of course, there's still a strong case for Welbeck to start for England, but what irks Mediawatch is Wright's refusal to acknowledge the debate is justified while simultaneously participating in said debate. 'In many ways it's just like bullying,' continues Wright on the 'head-scratching' opposition to Welbeck's inclusion. 'There's just no substance to it beyond the fact he plays for United - nothing more than that.' However, Wrighty then concedes: 'I can see why people want to see Sterling in there...' So which is it, Ian? An illogical view based purely on club tribalism, or just standard pre-World Cup discussion, which you're clearly happy to entertain despite insisting there is no debate to be had? Big Draw 'We are an Ecuadraw' boasts the headline in The Sun as they preview Wednesday's warm-up game. Writes Charlie Wyett: 'England are set to play in front of a 20,000-plus crowd against Ecuador in Miami tomorrow. 'An official at Sun Life Stadium - home to the Miami Dolphins - said: "We were hoping for up to 30,000. But it's not bad as the game will be played in working hours." 'The ageing stadium can hold up to 76,000 but large sections will be sealed off. Tickets start at Â£20.' So apart from anticipating an extra 10,000 fans, and having to seal off some 50,000 seats despite reasonable prices, it certainly looks like England are a big (Ecua)draw. Durham As seems to be the trend on Tuesday, Adrian Durham sticks up for his England favourite on the MailOnline, insisting that Wayne Rooney is still the best player available to Roy Hodgson. His entire premise is detailed in four bullet points at the top of the page - which the Mail now attach to every article for those who can't be bothered to read - but Mediawatch still scrolled to the very bottom so you don't have to. 'When I read Mick Channon describing Rooney as the 'weak link' on Sportsmail last week I was shocked,' writes Durham. 'The former Manchester City and Southampton striker is right that Rooney hasn't delivered at a World Cup, but he's only the weak link if he offers less than the rest. 'Rooney doesn't deserve the criticism. He has earned the right with performances and goals for his club and country for us all to debate how to get the best out of him, rather than lazily writing him off.' How very noble. You can say what you like about Adrian Durham - and Mediawatch has said it all - but if there's one thing you'll never catch him doing it's lazily writing someone off. He'd never...oh, what's that? From July 2013: 'You're Carlo Ancelotti. You're deciding who would be the better signing - Wayne Rooney or Luis Suarez. It's a no-brainer. Rooney is miles ahead. 'In fact I wonder how good Luis Suarez actually is. He's got quality and ability - probably more than most. But looking good in the Dutch league and standing out in one of the most average Liverpool sides I've seen in my lifetime does not constitute a top-level player.' Ah, just when we thought we could be friends. Friends Headline on the MailOnline (we'll let you guess who penned the article): 'Chelsea would have won more friends if model pro Frank Lampard had been captain rather than tarnished John Terry.' Yes, because that's what competitive sport is about. And Finally... 'How dare Southampton hold Adam Lallana back?' Oh God, no more Durham. Ever. Please. Like Rain On Your Wedding Day Writes Dave Kidd in the Daily Mirror: 'There's a certain irony in the fact that Spurs have told Mauricio Pochettino he must speak English in press conferences, having sacked Tim Sherwood for speaking too much plain English in press conferences.' Two things: 1) Tim Sherwood wasn't sacked for 'speaking too much plain English'. He was sacked owing to a dreadful record against Spurs' top-four rivals and because he was accused of having lost the players' confidence. 2) That isn't ironic. Exclusively Bulls**t '16 CLUBS CHASE FRANK', booms the 'WORLD EXCLUSIVE' on the back page of The Sun, with scribe Andrew Dillon writing: 'Frank Lampard is the world's most wanted player with 16 clubs chasing him.' Wow, 16 clubs. We'd love to know who they are, and surely The Sun are prepared to divulge that information given that it's a 'WORLD EXCLUSIVE'. Otherwise, isn't this just another story saying Lampard has options? 'Italians Fiorentina and clubs in Qatar and Brazil have added their names to the long list of teams who want to land him,' Dillon continues. 'LA Galaxy have re-emerged as contenders as well, along with the MLS' newest franchise New York City. 'And, as SunSport exclusively revealed last week, Lamps' uncle, QPR boss Harry Redknapp, is desperate to lure the Blues legend after winning promotion to the top flight.' Mediawatch makes that four clubs The Sun have named in their 'WORLD EXCLUSIVE'. There must be an awful lot of teams in Qatar and Brazil. West West End Report the Daily Mirror: 'Spurs midfielder Paulinho has reacted to Chelsea dropping their interest in him by insisting he never wanted to quit White Hart Lane. 'The Brazilian World Cup star, who made it clear he wanted out of the club after a spell on the bench under Tim Sherwood, said: "I never considered returning to Brazil. It never crossed my mind."' He knows Chelsea are based just down the road, right? One To Keep Your Eye On 'Sergio Aguero is going nowhere this summer - after Manchester City ruled out a sale' - The Sun. 'Manchester City will not sell Sergio Aguero - even for a world-record fee' - the Daily Mirror. Mediawatch couldn't be more certain that's the last we'll hear of Aguero's links to Real Madrid... Joyful Father-To-Be Of The Day Said Philippe Senderos on the birth of his child: "I can only pray that the baby arrives once I am home from Brazil." Good to know he's got his priorities straight.

The 26-year-old phone user was text messaging his partner for a number of hours while in bed. 'But his excessive messaging led to him suffering from sudden flashes in his eyesight.

A Sterling Stick To Use On Hodgson... | F365 Says	It's very, very easy to write a column saying that the latest Bright Young Thing should start for England...but thankfully England have a manager and not an X Factor-style vote... Last Updated: 03/06/14 at 16:00 Post Comment Latest Articles ...that makes Rickie Lambert a good fit at Liverpool, says Adam Bate. He clearly does offer a Plan B but he's good enough to fit in with the Plan A too. It's sound... Roy Hodgson is saddened by England's obsession with Wayne Rooney, but what does he expect? The debate over the striker's inclusion is now more relevant than ever... In March, the Daily Mail's Martin Samuel - never a man shy to state his case against all manner of straw men and 'mistakes' yet to be made - decried the lack of wingers in the England World Cup squad that would not be named for another two months. He screamed for more 'crackerjack wide players', for Raheem Sterling, Andros Townsend, Adam Lallana, Adam Johnson and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to be on the plane to Brazil. 'One minute we bemoan the lack of talent, the next we haven't got room for it all. Make your minds up, gentlemen,' he wrote. We're unsure which anonymous 'gentlemen' he was addressing but presumably he's fuming that Johnson - rather good for five minutes at the turn of the year - was left behind. He should be pleased that Sterling, Lallana and Oxlade-Chamberlain did make the final 23-man squad but instead he's angry again... 'Raheem Sterling needs to start, Roy...England have a long-standing mistrust of talent that needs to end in Brazil,' was the headline on Monday's column, which fumes at the fact that the useful but uninspiring James Milner was brought on ahead of Sterling against Peru on Friday night. That will be Milner (45 caps) brought on ahead of Sterling (two caps) - a point Samuel uses to illustrate England's innate distrust of fancy players, via a whistlestop tour of Matt Le Tissier, Alan Hudson, Rodney Marsh, Stan Bowles, Tony Currie and Peter Osgood. What Samuel - and anyone else clamouring for the very talented but ultimately inexperienced Sterling to leapfrog Milner and Danny Welbeck - fails to recognise is that the Liverpool winger is just 19 and has already been fast-tracked into the senior set-up. Milner and Welbeck were not England internationals at 19; the fact that Sterling is there at all is an acknowledgement that he has a talent that far outweighs his rivals. The question is not whether he will become a better player than either of those hard-working but limited players, but whether he is a better option right now in what would easily be the biggest game of his career against Italy in Manaus. It's incredibly easy to shout for the inclusion of an in-form player - especially when he plays for a club with a large and vociferous fanbase - and it's even easier when the alternatives appear to be so stodgy. There aren't many putting their hands up and pointing out that Welbeck had an incredibly similar strike rate to Sterling this season (nine goals from 45/46 shots) and was excellent against Bayern Munich in the Champions League, while Milner probably has even fewer people in his corner despite two Premier League titles in the last three seasons. Having been robbed of one 'conservative' beating stick by Hodgson's brave and balanced squad selection (conservative would have been to include Ashley Cole, Michael Carrick and Jermain Defoe), the next stick in hand is his reluctance to play the season's in-form XI, with no regard to performances in training, mental aptitude, experience or specific gameplans for specific opponents. Sod all that stuff, just play the kid who looks exciting - it's the easiest column to write as we approach a major tournament. Sterling will start against Ecuador on Wednesday, could well be ruddy marvellous, but still find himself on the bench against Honduras on Saturday and Italy a week later. Hands will be thrown up in the hair and we will wonder whether the same hands were thrown in the air 16 years ago when the precociously talented 18-year-old Michael Owen was left out of the starting line-up as England began their World Cup campaign in France. Two games and two lively substitute appearances later, Owen - now acclimatised to tournament football - came into the England side, along with the similarly untested David Beckham. The England manager that year was Glenn Hoddle, now regularly wheeled out as one of the great sages of the game and a potential saviour of English football. He saved Owen until he was sure he was ready, initially using his pace as an 'option off the bench', a phrase decried by Samuel this week. Hodgson may well decide to start Sterling against Italy - after all, he threw in the similarly youthful Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain two years ago - but should he choose the diligent Welbeck instead, it will be a decision based on rather more than 'who is the better player?' It's why we have a manager and don't choose the England team by public vote. Sarah Winterburn	sports

I daresay there are a few players from the era of outside-right-half-forwards that I've never heard of who were quite good; but for those of us who don't remember anything pre-Italia 90, I'd put Frank in third behind David Platt and Bryan Robson.

Amongst the many flaws of his system is the fact that I can't imagine any sane minded Real Madrid fan (for example) getting too excited if Aaron Lennon or Kyle Walker were linked to their club can you? Rob Pearse Cesc Never Won Owt In response to Conor (Honestly, I'm not carrying emotional baggage), Gooner, Dublin. First of all, I totally understand the romance of bringing Cesc back. I even think we could make room for him because, after all, he is a fantastic player. My issue is with the idea that bringing him back would represent the return of some kind of talisman who bought us through so many "bad times". The idea that bringing him back would somehow return us to our former glory. I'd just like to respectfully point out that we won absolutely nothing in the period that Cesc was our captain. It would be nice to heap some praise on those players who have put in the sort of performances that did finally break the drought. Mertesacker, Koscielny, Ramsey, Giroud - all players who came through bad times and now actually have something to show for it. Nothing wrong with a bit of romance but let's have it right, as good as Cesc was, we never saw him lift a trophy. Ben Smith - North Bank. Silly To Swap Ozil I would love nothing more than to have Cesc back in the side. Watching that goal against Tottenham again today reminded me of so many good times when he was at the club. However, swapping Ozil for Fabregas would be silly. Top of our assist charts, one of the biggest summer signings globally, our catalyst for last season and a trophy. Selling him and bringing in Cesc will look (not necessarily be) a step backwards ... So what are the other options? Adding without selling would mean we would be overloaded in midfield. Cazorla? Love him to bits and would hate to see him leave but he is 29 now and Cesc certainly wouldn't be a downgrade. Arteta? Not really a like for like replacement but I felt Arteta has been on the decline this season.. Still sometimes you do need someone to slow the pace of the game down Wilshire? Tricky one this. If Wilshire can get over his injuries he could be world class but he has been out-shined by Ramsey and will surely get less play time next season as a result...However, you do need a certain amount of English players in the Champs squad. And he is very good Ramsey? No I think ultimately no matter how much we love Cesc, I don't think there is a space for him in the squad anymore (i would argue that the only choice would be for Cazorla). It would hurt to see him play for a different english club but I would hope that he would "be injured" whenever he played us Rob (To be honest, I don't think Ozil looked like he enjoyed playing at Real that much either) AFC Anthems To Jae, Tunbridge Wells, who had a pop at "God Save the Queen," just be thankful that you're not from the USA. We've got an anthem that is virtually unsingable (and the tune was written by a man named John Smith, for crying out loud), and whose words are so convoluted that maybe 1 out of 10 Americans can tell you what they actually mean. Almost nobody likes it. I'd be very happy with "God Save the Queen," and in fact we already have it here, only with different words and titled "My Country 'Tis of Thee." But we stick with "The Star Spangled Banner," because...well, because. But what I'd really like is "Il Canto Degli Italiani," the Italian national anthem, an unabashed piece of militarism that's just flat-out fun, in a way that only the Italians can manage. PeterG, Pennsylavnia, USA Zing To add to the Non-English and where we stand on supporting England..... I am from Cardiff, the Capital City of Wales. Support nobody but Cardiff City and Wales but have lived and worked in London for about 5 years. I have just drawn England in my work sweepstake. .............however I do get Â£16 as a losing finalist! Rob Addressing A Few Points Conor, Dublin Gooner. Apart from not being sure how Man U are Arsenal's "ex best-mate" and how Chelsea are their "younger, richer, more successful neighbour", I didn't think we were allowed to do those "It's like when you're going out with/not going out with/meeting up with when too drunk to realise it's a stupid idea" analogies any more. I mean, it just isn't like that. It's like when a bloke who used to play for your football team went and played for another one. It most assuredly is nothing like having a real girlfriend who then, ah...I see. Moving on. Frank Lampard's "obscene goal output" is largely due to him taking about 150 penalties (guessed) over his career at Chelsea. Given just this, my goal output would be at least "creditable". I'm with you Chris MUFC. I'd have preferred it if we hadn't appealed Rooney's quite-deserved 3 game ban and not taken him to the last tournament. I thought we were doing better without him. Of course, we'll never know but I think we might well be better off now if he were just another 9 as opposed to the supposedly essential and yet clearly detrimental axis around which everything else must be shoe-horned into orbit. In which case, Tom London, I heartily disagree. He's not our "best player" (subjective yet stated as fact). He's been the "essential axis around which everything else must be shoe-horned into orbit" for ten years and considering his position, he bloody well should be our highest goal-scorer and would still be even if he was one of those players who just did their job in a formation (clue, scored goals) rather than being all of that, the second-coming and Gazza on a cracker at the same time. I would rather see this than people (Wazza included) shunted out of position to accommodate him because I'm one of those sane men, women or children who don't believe we'd win the thing with 11 of him. Nobody thinks Welbeck is a better option. Inventing a ridiculous argument that nobody is having to juxtapose your idea doesn't reflect as well upon it as you think. Jae, Tunbridge Wells (disgusted of?) I stopped at the Spanish not needing a good sing-along. Presumably you know that their anthem doesn't have any words (officially) and that quite obviously this is not the most important difference between the lavishly gifted Spain squad and that of the rather more workmanlike stylings of England. Beyond that, I couldn't really what sort of sensible point you might be about to make. Then the asterisks caught my eye and I might have done you a disservice. The bit in between was obviously bollocks but yes, this should be our new national anthem. Ed, Weymouth. Do it mate. I've been to south Dorset. It deserves it. Besides, I like Fearne. Rather more thanks to your capitalised MIDDLE-NAMING of her. Cheers, Jim (I know, not much constructive to offer) Essex Best World Cups Jim, Bali (Coming for your job, Degsy) is right. Get your money on Argentina. I've done a predictor as well and also have them beating Brazil in the final, although I have England going out to Columbia in the 2nd round (due to the stifling heat, Rooney playing like a hod carrier, and Glenn Johnson playing). Regarding favourite past tournaments, Argentina '78 was great partly due to the ticker tape and dark flowing locks of Mario Kempes, but 1982 in Spain comes out tops for me. The atmosphere was intense, and Brazil were unbelievable to watch (all you tiki-taka fans would do well to spend time having a shufty at that team to realise what exciting football really is). I could rhyme off a list of their footballing gods such as Socrates, Falcao, Junior, Zico, plus plenty of their goals which could've been sold off as works of art, and this would easily make my point, but the player who will always stick in my memory was Eder, who made the spectacular seem the norm. Volleys, chips, thunderb*st*rds were almost to be expected when he played. My favourite Eder moment was actually one that he missed, against Argentina, where he takes a lengthy run up not unlike cricketer Michael Holding would have done in his pomp (I can't find the Motson commentary but he chirped something like "And Eder is lining up what looks like a tremendous shot"), meets the ball with the outside of his foot and fires a curving, dipping piledriver which crashes against the bar, leaving Zico an easy tap in. Witness: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCFL1UEJ47M. Mesmerising. Their lack of concentration on defence meant they went out to eventual winners Italy, and a Paulo Rossi hat-trick, in the semis, but at least the Italy/Germany final provided this! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XOL8o-3TZ8. I rest my case. Steve Smith (LFC) Top XIs Re. Bernard (France 98 is still my fave) MUFC Here's my stab at your one country represented world cup XI (plus the full complement 12 on the bench because I like a challenge): GK: Thibaut Courtois - Belgium RB: Pablo Zabaleta - Argentina LB: Philipp Lahm - Germany CB: Sergio Ramos - Spain CB: RaphaÃ«l Varane - France DM: Daniele De Rossi - Italy CM: Yaya TourÃ© - Ivory Coast CM: Fernandinho - Brazil RW: Alexis SÃ¡nchez - Chile LW: Cristiano Ronaldo - Portugal FW: Luis Suarez - Uruguay Subs: Joe Hart (England), JoÃ«l Matip (Cameroon), Stephan Lichtsteiner (Switazerland), Nigel De Jong (Netherlands), Mile Jedinak (Australia), Luka ModriÄ (Croatia), Fredy GuarÃ­n (Colombia), Shinji Kagawa (Japan), Miralem PjaniÄ (BiH), Javier HernÃ¡ndez (Mexico), Kevin-Prince Boateng (Ghana) , Igor Akinfeev (Russia) Blue Tim (France '98 is also my fav; watched it in a bowling alley in Boulogne on a school trip) ...Bernard (France 98 is still my fave) MUFC's letter is one of those classic World Cup warm-up games. Although, when he said his one Brazilian was a defender I was definitely expecting their best defender. Dante ahead of Silva?! An attempt (4-3-3): Akinfeev (Russia); Abate (Italy), Tiago Silva (Brazil), Kompany (Belgium), Lahm (Germany); Iniesta (Spain), Vidal (Chile), Pogba (France); Suarez (Uruguay), Messi (Argentina), Ronaldo (Portugal). Ok, Akinfeev is very good but probably not a world beater. In front of him though are a back 4 with so much ability I think he'd be safe enough. Joe Hart instead maybe? A midfield with a mix of power, dynamism and brains. And those 3 up front. Might not pass to each other a lot, but shouldn't need to. Paraic (Who should I support?), Ireland	sports

Silly To Swap Ozil I would love nothing more than to have Cesc back in the side. Watching that goal against Tottenham again today reminded me of so many good times when he was at the club. However, swapping Ozil for Fabregas would be silly. Top of our assist charts, one of the biggest summer signings globally, our catalyst for last season and a trophy. Selling him and bringing in Cesc will look (not necessarily be) a step backwards ... So what are the other options? Adding without selling would mean we would be overloaded in midfield. Cazorla? Love him to bits and would hate to see him leave but he is 29 now and Cesc certainly wouldn't be a downgrade. Arteta? Not really a like for like replacement but I felt Arteta has been on the decline this season.. Still sometimes you do need someone to slow the pace of the game down Wilshire? Tricky one this. If Wilshire can get over his injuries he could be world class but he has been out-shined by Ramsey and will surely get less play time next season as a result...However, you do need a certain amount of English players in the Champs squad. And he is very good Ramsey? No I think ultimately no matter how much we love Cesc, I don't think there is a space for him in the squad anymore (i would argue that the only choice would be for Cazorla). It would hurt to see him play for a different english club but I would hope that he would "be injured" whenever he played us Rob (To be honest, I don't think Ozil looked like he enjoyed playing at Real that much either) AFC Anthems To Jae, Tunbridge Wells, who had a pop at "God Save the Queen," just be thankful that you're not from the USA. We've got an anthem that is virtually unsingable (and the tune was written by a man named John Smith, for crying out loud), and whose words are so convoluted that maybe 1 out of 10 Americans can tell you what they actually mean. Almost nobody likes it. I'd be very happy with "God Save the Queen," and in fact we already have it here, only with different words and titled "My Country 'Tis of Thee." But we stick with "The Star Spangled Banner," because...well, because. But what I'd really like is "Il Canto Degli Italiani," the Italian national anthem, an unabashed piece of militarism that's just flat-out fun, in a way that only the Italians can manage. PeterG, Pennsylavnia, USA Zing To add to the Non-English and where we stand on supporting England..... I am from Cardiff, the Capital City of Wales. Support nobody but Cardiff City and Wales but have lived and worked in London for about 5 years. I have just drawn England in my work sweepstake. .............however I do get Â£16 as a losing finalist! Rob Addressing A Few Points Conor, Dublin Gooner. Apart from not being sure how Man U are Arsenal's "ex best-mate" and how Chelsea are their "younger, richer, more successful neighbour", I didn't think we were allowed to do those "It's like when you're going out with/not going out with/meeting up with when too drunk to realise it's a stupid idea" analogies any more. I mean, it just isn't like that. It's like when a bloke who used to play for your football team went and played for another one. It most assuredly is nothing like having a real girlfriend who then, ah...I see. Moving on. Frank Lampard's "obscene goal output" is largely due to him taking about 150 penalties (guessed) over his career at Chelsea. Given just this, my goal output would be at least "creditable". I'm with you Chris MUFC. I'd have preferred it if we hadn't appealed Rooney's quite-deserved 3 game ban and not taken him to the last tournament. I thought we were doing better without him. Of course, we'll never know but I think we might well be better off now if he were just another 9 as opposed to the supposedly essential and yet clearly detrimental axis around which everything else must be shoe-horned into orbit. In which case, Tom London, I heartily disagree. He's not our "best player" (subjective yet stated as fact). He's been the "essential axis around which everything else must be shoe-horned into orbit" for ten years and considering his position, he bloody well should be our highest goal-scorer and would still be even if he was one of those players who just did their job in a formation (clue, scored goals) rather than being all of that, the second-coming and Gazza on a cracker at the same time. I would rather see this than people (Wazza included) shunted out of position to accommodate him because I'm one of those sane men, women or children who don't believe we'd win the thing with 11 of him. Nobody thinks Welbeck is a better option. Inventing a ridiculous argument that nobody is having to juxtapose your idea doesn't reflect as well upon it as you think. Jae, Tunbridge Wells (disgusted of?) I stopped at the Spanish not needing a good sing-along. Presumably you know that their anthem doesn't have any words (officially) and that quite obviously this is not the most important difference between the lavishly gifted Spain squad and that of the rather more workmanlike stylings of England. Beyond that, I couldn't really what sort of sensible point you might be about to make. Then the asterisks caught my eye and I might have done you a disservice. The bit in between was obviously bollocks but yes, this should be our new national anthem. Ed, Weymouth. Do it mate. I've been to south Dorset. It deserves it. Besides, I like Fearne. Rather more thanks to your capitalised MIDDLE-NAMING of her. Cheers, Jim (I know, not much constructive to offer) Essex Best World Cups Jim, Bali (Coming for your job, Degsy) is right. Get your money on Argentina. I've done a predictor as well and also have them beating Brazil in the final, although I have England going out to Columbia in the 2nd round (due to the stifling heat, Rooney playing like a hod carrier, and Glenn Johnson playing). Regarding favourite past tournaments, Argentina '78 was great partly due to the ticker tape and dark flowing locks of Mario Kempes, but 1982 in Spain comes out tops for me. The atmosphere was intense, and Brazil were unbelievable to watch (all you tiki-taka fans would do well to spend time having a shufty at that team to realise what exciting football really is). I could rhyme off a list of their footballing gods such as Socrates, Falcao, Junior, Zico, plus plenty of their goals which could've been sold off as works of art, and this would easily make my point, but the player who will always stick in my memory was Eder, who made the spectacular seem the norm. Volleys, chips, thunderb*st*rds were almost to be expected when he played. My favourite Eder moment was actually one that he missed, against Argentina, where he takes a lengthy run up not unlike cricketer Michael Holding would have done in his pomp (I can't find the Motson commentary but he chirped something like "And Eder is lining up what looks like a tremendous shot"), meets the ball with the outside of his foot and fires a curving, dipping piledriver which crashes against the bar, leaving Zico an easy tap in. Witness: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCFL1UEJ47M. Mesmerising. Their lack of concentration on defence meant they went out to eventual winners Italy, and a Paulo Rossi hat-trick, in the semis, but at least the Italy/Germany final provided this! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XOL8o-3TZ8. I rest my case. Steve Smith (LFC) Top XIs Re. Bernard (France 98 is still my fave) MUFC Here's my stab at your one country represented world cup XI (plus the full complement 12 on the bench because I like a challenge): GK: Thibaut Courtois - Belgium RB: Pablo Zabaleta - Argentina LB: Philipp Lahm - Germany CB: Sergio Ramos - Spain CB: RaphaÃ«l Varane - France DM: Daniele De Rossi - Italy CM: Yaya TourÃ© - Ivory Coast CM: Fernandinho - Brazil RW: Alexis SÃ¡nchez - Chile LW: Cristiano Ronaldo - Portugal FW: Luis Suarez - Uruguay Subs: Joe Hart (England), JoÃ«l Matip (Cameroon), Stephan Lichtsteiner (Switazerland), Nigel De Jong (Netherlands), Mile Jedinak (Australia), Luka ModriÄ (Croatia), Fredy GuarÃ­n (Colombia), Shinji Kagawa (Japan), Miralem PjaniÄ (BiH), Javier HernÃ¡ndez (Mexico), Kevin-Prince Boateng (Ghana) , Igor Akinfeev (Russia) Blue Tim (France '98 is also my fav; watched it in a bowling alley in Boulogne on a school trip) ...Bernard (France 98 is still my fave) MUFC's letter is one of those classic World Cup warm-up games. Although, when he said his one Brazilian was a defender I was definitely expecting their best defender. Dante ahead of Silva?! An attempt (4-3-3): Akinfeev (Russia); Abate (Italy), Tiago Silva (Brazil), Kompany (Belgium), Lahm (Germany); Iniesta (Spain), Vidal (Chile), Pogba (France); Suarez (Uruguay), Messi (Argentina), Ronaldo (Portugal). Ok, Akinfeev is very good but probably not a world beater. In front of him though are a back 4 with so much ability I think he'd be safe enough. Joe Hart instead maybe? A midfield with a mix of power, dynamism and brains. And those 3 up front. Might not pass to each other a lot, but shouldn't need to. Paraic (Who should I support?), Ireland	sports

World Cup Group Analysis: Group G - Goal.com	Goal analyzes all the eight groups in this year's world cup. Continuing with our series, we take a look at Group G... SPECIAL By Shikharr Chandra GERMANY Profile Titles: FIFA World Cup (1954, 1974, 1990), Confederations Cup (1999), European Championship (1972, 1980, 1996)Â  Top Scorer: Miroslav Klose (68) Most Apearances: Lothar Matthaus (150) FIFA Ranking: 2 Star Man: Mario Gotze Appearances: 28 Goals: 7 Formation 4-2-3-1 Â  Coach Part of the German camp for over 10 years now, Joachim Low comes across as one of the most offensive coaches in this summer's tournament. Low, who has led the Germans in the last two European Championships and the 2010 World Cup, which saw his side succumb to pressure during the final few games of each of those tournaments. Low's philosophy is based on quick passing and keeping possession. What would be interesting to note is whether he will play with a false 9 or go with a more direct approach with a center forward in the side. How they set up Die Adler will look to setup in their usual 4-2-3-1 formation with the main aim being to keep the ball and not allow the oppositions to take control of the game. Low, whose German sides were based on quick counter attacks four years ago have completely changed their setup and ball retention now remains the key aspect of their game. It will be interesting to see if Sami Khedira gets a run-in the side considering how little he's played in the seson gone by. Instead, the likes of Toni Kroos and Bastian Schweinsteiger offer much more in that role than the Real Madrid midfielder. The pressing question though, is whether Germany opt for a false nine in Mario Gotze or go for an out and out striker in Miroslav Klose. He has tested the use of a false nine over the last few years now and it is highly likely that the side may use Gotze to fill in that role. Key Players The likes of Gotze, Lukas Podolski, Thomas Muller, Mesut Ozil all add attacking quality to the side and are most likely to provide goals considering the dearth of strikers. The impressive form of defender turned midfielder Phillip Lahm is an encouraging sign for the manager. Lahm spent most of the season as a central midfielder and provides another option in that department. Manuel Neuer, rated as one of the best goalkeepers in the world, will certainly play a key role in ensuring Germany have a successful campaign. Strengths and Weaknesses Germany's major weakness is in their striking department. It is most likely that the side will start with a false nine in Gotze, but Low's experiment has hardly paid off over the past few years where the Germans have looked unconvincing to say the least. The injury to star midfielder Marco Reus comes as a big blow, given that the Dortmund winger was the most in-form German player heading into the tournament. Their midfield though is capable of winning any games. The side has enormous depth and quality to provide both goals and assists and bail them out from pressure situations. The Bayern Munich contigent in the side has had an exceptional domestic season and their form will be key to the side's chances of winning the cup. Expectation As always, Germany will go in the tournament as one of the favourites to lift the World Cup. Low's side have all the quality and depth and anything less than a semi-final finish could be seen as a major disappointment. Their major test though will come towards the end of the tournament and it will be interesting to see, whether they could cope with pressure.Â  PORTUGAL Profile Titles: None Top Scorer: Cristiano Ronaldo (49) Most Apearances: Luis Figo (127) FIFA Ranking: 4 Star Man: Cristiano Ronaldo Appearances: 110 Goals: 49 Formation 4-3-3 Â  Coach Head coach Paulo Bento has now been a part of the camp for over four years and his quick counter attacking style has benefited the side in recent tournaments. HeÂ  has improved this side drastically from the one Carlos Queiroz had and although his side lack the quality the most major teams possess, Bento's Portugal could surprise a few. How they set up Bento's side is expeced to line up in their usual 4-3-3 formation with Helder Postiga being supported by Cristiano Ronaldo and Nani from the wings. The impressive form of William Carvalho this season could see him dethrone Raul Meireles as the defensive midfielder in the side whereas both Joao Moutinho and Miguel Veloso would provide the creative spark for the side. The major factor though will be whether Bento goes for an out and out striker in Postiga or shifts Ronaldo as the center forward. The side has hardly changed from the one that was put out in the Euro 2012 and the counter attacking style is expected to continue in Brazil as well. Key Players Ronaldo will once again be the star man in the Portuguese lineup. The Real Madrid man has had a blistering year playing a key role in the side's tenth European crown. The Real Madrid forward can provide goals, assits and is dangerous from set pieces. Alongside Ronaldo, Portugal's impressive midfield of Meireles, Moutinho will play a key role in assisting Cristiano in attack whereas in form Carvlaho will play a key role as the defensive midfielder in the side. Defensively the form of Pepe and Fabio Coentrao will come as a major boost for Bento and the camp. Strengths and Weaknesses Portugal's strength comes in their industrious midfield and their defensive solidarity. The likes of Bruno Alves, Fabio Coentrao and Pepe provide both defensive certainty as well as attacking threat from set pieces. Of course Ronaldo is their star player and his performances will determine how they shape up in attack. Portugal need to ensure they amalgamate around Ronaldo. Miguel Veloso, Moutinho provide creativity whereas Carvalho and Meireles will provide some much needed cover in their defensive third. Portugal's Achiles Heel has always been their striking department. A Selecao have not found the right man to lead them upfront for some time now and the idea of playing Ronaldo as a striker instead on the wings could backfire. The Real Madrid man has often been delpoyed as a number nine but has failed to flourish in the same manner as he has on the wings. The lack of game time for Manchester United winger Nani could be another issue for Bento in the tournament. The former Sporting manager needs to find the right partner for Ronaldo in attack and at present the options in hand don't look great. Expectation The Portuguese will be expected to progress from the group but it's hard to see them lasting long in the tournament. Anything over quarter-finals will be seen a good achievementÂ  for Bento's side. GHANA Profile Titles: African Cup of Nations ( 1963, 1965, 1978, 1982) Top Scorer: Edward Acquah (40) Most Apearances: Asamoah Gyan (at present-77) FIFA Ranking: 38 Star Man: Asamoah Gyan Appearances: 77 Goals: 39 Formation 4-2-3-1 Â  Coach Coach Kwesi Appiah becomes the only homegrown coach to lead Ghana into the World Cup finals. He is also among the two African coaches in this summers tournament. Appiah is no stranger to this side having led them as a caretaker manager before and was also the assistant manager when the side finished fourth in the African Cup of Nations back in 2013. The Ghanaian is known to provide free flowing attacking football and despite a demanding group, theÂ  Black Stars are expected to continue their exciting brand of football. How they set up Ghana will lineup in their usual 4-2-3-1 formation, with the main focus being on their attack and the stern midfield they have at their disposal. The likes of Micheal Essien, Suley Muntari and Andrew Ayew provide quality as well as experience in the heart of the midfield, whereas Kevin Prince-Boateng will look to play a key role in the attack. Chelsea's youngster Christian Atsu could surprise a few with his skill and flair and can be one of the leading young prospects of the tournament. Appiah's use of 4-4-2 and often 4-5-1 gives them an alternative plan going into the game which could prove to be useful in defending against the likes of Portugal or Germany when needed.Â  Key Players Asamoah Gyan will look to put away the nightmare of the last World Cup behind him and lead the attack for the Africans. The former Sunderland striker has a knack for goals and his experience in the attack will come in handy. The likes of Essien, Boateng and Muntari will play a major role as well in providing balance to the side. Strengths and Weaknesses Ghana's strength lies in their experience. The likes of Essien, Muntari, Gyan, Boateng have all played for leading European clubs and have the experience of handling pressure situations. Appiah has done well to get the best out of this side on numerous occasions and their impressive qualifying campaign serves as an indication of that. Their major weakness though comes in the defense. As much as their front men look established and well settled, the same cannot be said about their rear guard. The full back position remains one of the major issue of the side as Samuel Inkoom has hardly done enough to warrant a place in the team whereas the center back position looks unsettled too as Appiah still does not know his best back four. Expectation Ghana could surprise a few in this summer's tournament. The squad is experienced and have players capable of producing inspirational moments when needed. They could possibly manage to surpass the group but anything more than that looks a distant dream. U.S.A Profile Titles: CONCACAF Gold Cup (1991, 2002, 2005, 2007, 2013) Top Scorer: Landon Donovan (57) Most Appearances: Cobi Jones (164) FIFA Ranking: 13 Star Man: Clint Dempsey Appearances: 104 Goals: 37 Formation 4-2-3-1 Â  Coach The forer German international and coach, Jurgen Klinsmann will make his second appearance in the World Cup after leading the Germans to a semi-final finish in the 2006 World Cup. The former Bayern Munich manager has based his footballing philosophy on attack over the years and despite having a torrid start to life as US Men's National team coach (USMNT), the German has won over many hearts following their impressive performance in the CONACAF Championships last year. How they set up Klinsmann will look to set his side up in the usual 4-2-3-1 formation with Jozy Altidore leading the side from the front and Clint Dempsey providing the support right behind him. Michael Bradley will play the role of the anchorman in the midfield and will look to provide the key passes, as well as make those forward runs he is so used to. His partner Jermaine Jones is expected to cover up for him and do most of the dirty work in the side. Graham Zusi and Cobi Jones will make up the forward line in the attack alongside Dempsey and their pace and skills will come in handy. Damarcus Beasley's impressive form will see him continue as the left back despite being played as a midfielder for most part of his career, whereas impressive Matt Bresler will lead the defense. Jozy Altidore's strength makes him a good option to have upfront as it will allow him to hold the ball better thus allowing the rest to take part in the attack and providing more options for Klinsmann's men. Key Players One needs to look no further than the two most experienced players in the side in Tim Howard and Clint Dempsey as the star men. The duo have over 200 caps together and could play a key role in the side. Dempsey will have some added pressure on him considering the absence of Landon Donovan from the side this summer. Graham Zusi is another player who will garner much attention. The midfielder has been called up as a replacement for Donovan and a lot of eyes will be on him to deliver and live upto the expectations of his coach. Strengths and Weaknesses USA's major strength lies upfront with the likes of Zusi, Dempsey, Bradley all having a relatively decent seasons with their repective clubs. What will be worrying though is the form of striker Altidore who has had a torrid season for Sunderland this time around. The absence of Donovan though comes as the major blow for the side and could hurt them. Klinsmann might have taken a big step by omitting the star midfielder, but it is a gamble that could backfire. Beasley's impressive performances as a left back comes as a much needed boost for the side. The midfielder turned defender has done well for the national side over the years and could provide necessary cover for the defense. Expectation Not many will give the USMNT a chance to progress from this group. TheÂ CONCACAF Champions have a good squad but when pitted against the likes of Portugal and Ghana there is hardly any chance. A group stage exit looks likely. PREDICTION: 1. Germany 2. Portugal 3. Ghana 4. USA	sports

Their midfield though is capable of winning any games. The side has enormous depth and quality to provide both goals and assists and bail them out from pressure situations. The Bayern Munich contigent in the side has had an exceptional domestic season and their form will be key to the side's chances of winning the cup. Expectation As always, Germany will go in the tournament as one of the favourites to lift the World Cup. Low's side have all the quality and depth and anything less than a semi-final finish could be seen as a major disappointment. Their major test though will come towards the end of the tournament and it will be interesting to see, whether they could cope with pressure.Â  PORTUGAL Profile Titles: None Top Scorer: Cristiano Ronaldo (49) Most Apearances: Luis Figo (127) FIFA Ranking: 4 Star Man: Cristiano Ronaldo Appearances: 110 Goals: 49 Formation 4-3-3 Â  Coach Head coach Paulo Bento has now been a part of the camp for over four years and his quick counter attacking style has benefited the side in recent tournaments. HeÂ  has improved this side drastically from the one Carlos Queiroz had and although his side lack the quality the most major teams possess, Bento's Portugal could surprise a few. How they set up Bento's side is expeced to line up in their usual 4-3-3 formation with Helder Postiga being supported by Cristiano Ronaldo and Nani from the wings. The impressive form of William Carvalho this season could see him dethrone Raul Meireles as the defensive midfielder in the side whereas both Joao Moutinho and Miguel Veloso would provide the creative spark for the side. The major factor though will be whether Bento goes for an out and out striker in Postiga or shifts Ronaldo as the center forward. The side has hardly changed from the one that was put out in the Euro 2012 and the counter attacking style is expected to continue in Brazil as well. Key Players Ronaldo will once again be the star man in the Portuguese lineup. The Real Madrid man has had a blistering year playing a key role in the side's tenth European crown. The Real Madrid forward can provide goals, assits and is dangerous from set pieces. Alongside Ronaldo, Portugal's impressive midfield of Meireles, Moutinho will play a key role in assisting Cristiano in attack whereas in form Carvlaho will play a key role as the defensive midfielder in the side. Defensively the form of Pepe and Fabio Coentrao will come as a major boost for Bento and the camp. Strengths and Weaknesses Portugal's strength comes in their industrious midfield and their defensive solidarity. The likes of Bruno Alves, Fabio Coentrao and Pepe provide both defensive certainty as well as attacking threat from set pieces. Of course Ronaldo is their star player and his performances will determine how they shape up in attack. Portugal need to ensure they amalgamate around Ronaldo. Miguel Veloso, Moutinho provide creativity whereas Carvalho and Meireles will provide some much needed cover in their defensive third. Portugal's Achiles Heel has always been their striking department. A Selecao have not found the right man to lead them upfront for some time now and the idea of playing Ronaldo as a striker instead on the wings could backfire. The Real Madrid man has often been delpoyed as a number nine but has failed to flourish in the same manner as he has on the wings. The lack of game time for Manchester United winger Nani could be another issue for Bento in the tournament. The former Sporting manager needs to find the right partner for Ronaldo in attack and at present the options in hand don't look great. Expectation The Portuguese will be expected to progress from the group but it's hard to see them lasting long in the tournament. Anything over quarter-finals will be seen a good achievementÂ  for Bento's side. GHANA Profile Titles: African Cup of Nations ( 1963, 1965, 1978, 1982) Top Scorer: Edward Acquah (40) Most Apearances: Asamoah Gyan (at present-77) FIFA Ranking: 38 Star Man: Asamoah Gyan Appearances: 77 Goals: 39 Formation 4-2-3-1 Â  Coach Coach Kwesi Appiah becomes the only homegrown coach to lead Ghana into the World Cup finals. He is also among the two African coaches in this summers tournament. Appiah is no stranger to this side having led them as a caretaker manager before and was also the assistant manager when the side finished fourth in the African Cup of Nations back in 2013. The Ghanaian is known to provide free flowing attacking football and despite a demanding group, theÂ  Black Stars are expected to continue their exciting brand of football. How they set up Ghana will lineup in their usual 4-2-3-1 formation, with the main focus being on their attack and the stern midfield they have at their disposal. The likes of Micheal Essien, Suley Muntari and Andrew Ayew provide quality as well as experience in the heart of the midfield, whereas Kevin Prince-Boateng will look to play a key role in the attack. Chelsea's youngster Christian Atsu could surprise a few with his skill and flair and can be one of the leading young prospects of the tournament. Appiah's use of 4-4-2 and often 4-5-1 gives them an alternative plan going into the game which could prove to be useful in defending against the likes of Portugal or Germany when needed.Â  Key Players Asamoah Gyan will look to put away the nightmare of the last World Cup behind him and lead the attack for the Africans. The former Sunderland striker has a knack for goals and his experience in the attack will come in handy. The likes of Essien, Boateng and Muntari will play a major role as well in providing balance to the side. Strengths and Weaknesses Ghana's strength lies in their experience. The likes of Essien, Muntari, Gyan, Boateng have all played for leading European clubs and have the experience of handling pressure situations. Appiah has done well to get the best out of this side on numerous occasions and their impressive qualifying campaign serves as an indication of that. Their major weakness though comes in the defense. As much as their front men look established and well settled, the same cannot be said about their rear guard. The full back position remains one of the major issue of the side as Samuel Inkoom has hardly done enough to warrant a place in the team whereas the center back position looks unsettled too as Appiah still does not know his best back four. Expectation Ghana could surprise a few in this summer's tournament. The squad is experienced and have players capable of producing inspirational moments when needed. They could possibly manage to surpass the group but anything more than that looks a distant dream. U.S.A Profile Titles: CONCACAF Gold Cup (1991, 2002, 2005, 2007, 2013) Top Scorer: Landon Donovan (57) Most Appearances: Cobi Jones (164) FIFA Ranking: 13 Star Man: Clint Dempsey Appearances: 104 Goals: 37 Formation 4-2-3-1 Â  Coach The forer German international and coach, Jurgen Klinsmann will make his second appearance in the World Cup after leading the Germans to a semi-final finish in the 2006 World Cup. The former Bayern Munich manager has based his footballing philosophy on attack over the years and despite having a torrid start to life as US Men's National team coach (USMNT), the German has won over many hearts following their impressive performance in the CONACAF Championships last year. How they set up Klinsmann will look to set his side up in the usual 4-2-3-1 formation with Jozy Altidore leading the side from the front and Clint Dempsey providing the support right behind him. Michael Bradley will play the role of the anchorman in the midfield and will look to provide the key passes, as well as make those forward runs he is so used to. His partner Jermaine Jones is expected to cover up for him and do most of the dirty work in the side. Graham Zusi and Cobi Jones will make up the forward line in the attack alongside Dempsey and their pace and skills will come in handy. Damarcus Beasley's impressive form will see him continue as the left back despite being played as a midfielder for most part of his career, whereas impressive Matt Bresler will lead the defense. Jozy Altidore's strength makes him a good option to have upfront as it will allow him to hold the ball better thus allowing the rest to take part in the attack and providing more options for Klinsmann's men. Key Players One needs to look no further than the two most experienced players in the side in Tim Howard and Clint Dempsey as the star men. The duo have over 200 caps together and could play a key role in the side. Dempsey will have some added pressure on him considering the absence of Landon Donovan from the side this summer. Graham Zusi is another player who will garner much attention. The midfielder has been called up as a replacement for Donovan and a lot of eyes will be on him to deliver and live upto the expectations of his coach. Strengths and Weaknesses USA's major strength lies upfront with the likes of Zusi, Dempsey, Bradley all having a relatively decent seasons with their repective clubs. What will be worrying though is the form of striker Altidore who has had a torrid season for Sunderland this time around. The absence of Donovan though comes as the major blow for the side and could hurt them. Klinsmann might have taken a big step by omitting the star midfielder, but it is a gamble that could backfire. Beasley's impressive performances as a left back comes as a much needed boost for the side. The midfielder turned defender has done well for the national side over the years and could provide necessary cover for the defense. Expectation Not many will give the USMNT a chance to progress from this group. TheÂ CONCACAF Champions have a good squad but when pitted against the likes of Portugal and Ghana there is hardly any chance. A group stage exit looks likely. PREDICTION: 1. Germany 2. Portugal 3. Ghana 4. USA	sports

Brazil's World Cup hopes rest on the shoulders of Neymar - Goal.com	The Brazilian is arguably the best player in the Selecao squad and and his form could play a key role in their quest to land the World Cup after 12 long years... COMMENT By Shikharr Chandra On Monday morning, just two days before the opening game of the World Cup Neymar went down holding his ankle at the Teresopolis training ground in front of more than a thousand Brazil fans. There was a sense of anxiety among the supporters who saw their talisman down injured. A few minutes later, the Barcelona forward stood up and placed the ball to practice his free kicks. Neymar curled in three back-to-back free kicks right in the top corner with five men in the wall plus the goal-keeper who were left out as mere spectators. Service was restored in the Brazil camp. Neymar is without doubt the most influential player in this Brazil squad. A player on whom rests the hopes of not only the entire nation but also the millions of Brazil supporters all over the world. The portraits of the former Santos star can be found painted on the streets of Kolkata as well. A flag with 'We donât score with our hand' printed on it shows the loyalty the city has for the Brazilians and the expectations they have from the 'Prince' of the Selecao. For few years now, Neymar has been the rising star of this Brazil squad. The potential was always there, it was just the matter of how ready the 22-year old was to dawn the famous yellow jersey of Brazil. South American Footballer of the year at the age of 19, Neymar followed it with a Ballon D'Or nomination as well as landing the Puskas award the same year. He had announced himself to the world at such a tender age. Handed over the famous number 10 jersey for Brazil, previously dawned by the likes of Pele and Zico, in him the fans saw their messiah and the team-mates saw a player they could rely on during times of adversity. This was pretty evident with his performances first in the South American Youth Championships, then at the Olympics and later at the Confederations Cup, where he was handed the Golden Ball award for his impressive performances throughout the tournament. While the trust and the confidence bestowed by the fans has been incredible, there is a sense of fret amongst the supporters as well, as to whether their 'Prince' can live upto all the hype that has surrounded him this time around or will he succumb to pressure as many believe he has after his first season at Nou Camp. Neymar's Barcelona journey hasn't gone as planned, both on as well as off the field. The controversy surrounding his transfer usurped the likes of Barcelona president Sandro Rosell and eventually led to a trophyless season with manager Tata Martino being sacked. While many blame it on him not getting his desired role at the club due to the presence of a certain Lionel Messi in the squad, some believe the over the top expectations in his very first season in Europe led to the 'disappointment'. But judging him based on his Barcelona career is rather harsh. For a player born and bred in the South American style of football, it was never going to be easy settling into the European life. In addition to this, the psychological pressure of living up to the transfer fee that still remains one of the biggest mystery of last season. Add to this the constant comparison with Real Madrid's Gareth Bale certainly took a toll on him. His on-field antics did not help his case as well. From 28 starts for Barcelona, Neymar has scored 15 goals and provided 11 assists in all competitions. Flop? Definitely not. Especially when you consider him playing second fiddle to Messi for the majority of the season. At Brazil though, things are different. Luiz Felipe Scolari has based his entire setup to get the best out of his star player. From being deployed on the left flank, Neymar has been given the license to roam around and get as much of the ball as he can. Even striker Fred's duty is too hold the ball and involve the Barcelona forward as much as possible. Scolari knows the potential of Neymar and what he is capable of. When at his best, Neymar is an enticing player, probably on the same level as Cristiano Ronaldo or Messi. Neymar is at his exclusive best when donning the yellow jersey. His dribbling coupled with blistering pace make him a player worth watching on field. He makes things look so simple. The video of him stepping upto take the penalty kick during training and suddenly hitting it with the other leg caught the attention of millions on YouTube. Neymar's skills are not just limited to off-field show boating, on the field as well he has sparkled with the ball on his feet, blazing past defenders and often leaving them for dead. While his upper body strength remains in question as to whether he can handle the persistent fouls that come his way during the tournament, there is little doubt about his mental strength given that he has grown up with challenges in front of him and has consistently delivered on high expectations. The sun shone on Neymar during their game against Panama, and the entire nation will be hoping the sun shines on their wonder boy as he steps out at Sao Paolo tonight. A city that has seen so many struggles and protests lately because of the World Cup, needs its posterboy to step up and provide the trophy they are so obsessed with	sports

Karim Bencherifa: I want to win a trophy for Pune FC - Goal.com	The former Mariners coach explains that he is an ardent admirer of his new club's professionalism, hopes to establish an I-League winning team... Karim Bencharifa has stated that he hopes to put the experience he has gained from an ill-fated second reign at Mohun Bagan, to ensure that Pune FC are the ones who gain the most through his mentoring. Â  Speaking to Goal, Bencherifa was asked to shed light on his stint at Mohun Bagan, which saw the Kolkata stalwarts finish a lowly eighth last season. âIt was challenging and difficult but it was another learning experience which will be useful for my coaching carrier. "There were ups and downs, but I was hoping to do much better. For different reasons, it didn't happen. One of my biggest satisfactions is the discovery of some exciting new talents, which is almost impossible to do with the big Kolkata clubs due to the pressure on players and coaches.â Pressurized to describe the intricacies that led to his teamâs poor form, Bencherifa chose to be non-committal. âWithout going through the details when a team doesn't do well, the coach must take responsibility for that. So one of the reasons is myself but there other reasons which I don't want to elaborate and anyway I am a person who looks forward rather than complaining about the past. Overall there were many good moments and I will remember only this.â Having plied his trade in Goa and Kolkata only, Benncherifa's next job is in a city which isn't traditionally known to be a football hob. âI have no problem with that though I do feel that Pune have many people who know and follow the game. It is up to us to bring them to the stadium and get them interested more in the team, the key is our performances. We, including the players and the staff, have to create a dynamic around the club; play well, win games, be consistent and that's the key,â elucidated Bencherifa, who acknowledged the task at hand. Questioned on his target with the Red Lizards, he expressed hopefulness by stating that he would want to win a trophy with the club who haven't yet laid their hands on silverware. âI wish to help the club get the first silverware. Though Pune FC hasnât won any trophy yet I think they did a lot for Indian football and the I-League. They brought a lot of professionalism and fresh ideas on how to run a club. "They are a model in youth development and this will definitely work for the benefit of the club in the near future. So I am very hopeful about the outcome of the next season or two.â âWell despite that, I think over the years Pune FC always managed to build quite a strong, competitive team and we will try to do the same this year. The base and core of the team is there already, with some quality youngsters pushing their way to the first team." Pune FC are known not to splurge in the transfer market unlike some of the biggest Kolkata clubs. Bencherifa isn't concerned as he believes a pragmatic approach to finance is always a good option. "There is nothing wrong when a club spends wisely and thatâs what usually happens here,â replied Bencherifa. Finally the Moroccan aired his views on a long standing belief, that Pune FC were the most professional team in the country. âAs Iâve said before, Pune FC leads the way when it comes to professionalism, from the way they handle and take care of the first team, the organisation of the I-League matches, the setup of the youth development etc. "I am sure there will be much more to come. Thatâs one of the reasons I am excited to be associated with this club,â concluded Bencherifa, who no doubt wishes to weave an I-League winning campaign at his latest club. Â 	sports

2014 World Cup Brazil: A Primer - Goal.com	Goal takes time out to deconstruct the facts of the World Cup before it finally gets underway... The greatest tournament on earth is about to get underway in the football capital of the world in Brazil and Goal lays out the basic must know facts for anyone and everyone who wishes to survive for the next month and a half without appearing completely out of the loop.Â  What is the World Cup?Â  Â  When the need for an international football competition arose especially after the tremendous popularity of the sport, an amateur competition in the Olympics wasn't enough and a professional pan world competition was the order of the day leading to the 1930 'World Cup' in Uruguay which had seven nations from South America, four from Europe and two from North America with the host nation being victorious, in the inaugural competition. Who organises it? The first global football competition in the Olympics with only amateurs was organised by the FA (Football Association) of Britain. Then came the existence of FIFA (FÃ©dÃ©ration Internationale de Football Association), a body found in Switzerland by the football associations of Belgium, France, Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden and Germany for organising the game globally. Britain soon became a member and it was in 1950 Brazil that England finally participated in the World Cup which was again won by Uruguay. How many teams participate in the 'World Cup'? Originally it was limited to 16 nations till 1978 and expanded to 24 teams in 1982 and finally to its present number of 32 since 1986. Recently it was proposed by UEFA president Michel Platini, that the World Cup could be extended to 40 nations. "The World Cup is] not based on the quality of the teams because you don't have the best 32 at the World Cup, but it's a good compromise. It's a political matter so why not have more Africans? The competition is to bring all the people of all the world. If you don't give the possibility to participate, they don't improve."Â  Can we really call it the World Cup?Â  Not really but it certainly comes close in spite of the domination of the European and South American nations. In the soon to kickoff 2014 World Cup, 13 nations are from Europe, 6 from South America, 4 from North America, 5 from Africa and 4 from Asia. If you were to take the 32 best teams in the world, this would certainly not be it, but this certainly comes close in accordance of FIFA distributing berths regionally. Who is the official mascot of the FIFA World Cup? In keeping with the World Cup tradition of having a mascot, this time it's the turn of a three-banded Brazilian Armaddillo, a species native to Brazil and placed in the UN Red list amongst those vulnerable. Fuleco was the name chosen by fans which is a combination of the words football and ecology. The lively character can be found wearing a white T-shirt with the words 'Brasil 2014'.Â  Where will the World Cup be played? With the rotatory policy of FIFA, it was the turn of South America to host the 'Cup of Joy' and only Colombia and Brazil were the interested parties. However later with Colombia pulling out, Brazil were the only choice. Twelve venues in Brazil have been selected to host the grand competition with seven brand new and five renovated stadiums. These included popular spots like Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and Brasilia to relatively desolate spots like Manaus, which have no local football team.Â  What is the reason for all the protests if Brazil is such a football crazy nation? We might think that a zealous football loving nation like Brazil would be overjoyed to host the sport they love. Of course they are, but the ground realities are very harsh. With the nation in an impoverished condition, the people are not taking it too kindly as the Brasil government has bowed down to all the demands of FIFA including tax exemption to the tune of more than 270 million dollars. A Brazil public safety law which prohibited alcohol consumption in stadiums too was turned down because one of the alcohol beverage company was one of the official sponsors of the World Cup. When can I watch the World Cup?Â  For us in India, the World Cup starts like everyone else from tomorrow. But, with the drastically different time zones, the games will unfortunately be telecasted from midnight to dawn, with kickoffs at 12.30 AM, 1.30 AM, 3.30 AM and 6.30 AM. For the people who cannot stay awake even for this, breathe easy -as there are indeed a couple of matches at primetime which is 9.30 PM. For the complete TV Guide to the World Cup look here.Â  Why does the World Cup have an official ball?Â  Since 1970 Adidas has been an official sponsor for FIFA in World Cups and part of this is they get to name the official match ball in the Cup. For the last World Cup, it was christened Jabulani and this time it is Brazuca, the first ball to have its name was chosen by the fans. An interesting fact with regards to the Brazuca, is that the ball was manufactured close to home, by Forward Sports in Sialkot, Pakistan.Â 	sports

Britain soon became a member and it was in 1950 Brazil that England finally participated in the World Cup which was again won by Uruguay. How many teams participate in the 'World Cup'? Originally it was limited to 16 nations till 1978 and expanded to 24 teams in 1982 and finally to its present number of 32 since 1986. Recently it was proposed by UEFA president Michel Platini, that the World Cup could be extended to 40 nations. "The World Cup is] not based on the quality of the teams because you don't have the best 32 at the World Cup, but it's a good compromise. It's a political matter so why not have more Africans? The competition is to bring all the people of all the world. If you don't give the possibility to participate, they don't improve."Â  Can we really call it the World Cup?Â  Not really but it certainly comes close in spite of the domination of the European and South American nations. In the soon to kickoff 2014 World Cup, 13 nations are from Europe, 6 from South America, 4 from North America, 5 from Africa and 4 from Asia. If you were to take the 32 best teams in the world, this would certainly not be it, but this certainly comes close in accordance of FIFA distributing berths regionally. Who is the official mascot of the FIFA World Cup? In keeping with the World Cup tradition of having a mascot, this time it's the turn of a three-banded Brazilian Armaddillo, a species native to Brazil and placed in the UN Red list amongst those vulnerable. Fuleco was the name chosen by fans which is a combination of the words football and ecology. The lively character can be found wearing a white T-shirt with the words 'Brasil 2014'.Â  Where will the World Cup be played? With the rotatory policy of FIFA, it was the turn of South America to host the 'Cup of Joy' and only Colombia and Brazil were the interested parties. However later with Colombia pulling out, Brazil were the only choice. Twelve venues in Brazil have been selected to host the grand competition with seven brand new and five renovated stadiums. These included popular spots like Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and Brasilia to relatively desolate spots like Manaus, which have no local football team.Â  What is the reason for all the protests if Brazil is such a football crazy nation? We might think that a zealous football loving nation like Brazil would be overjoyed to host the sport they love. Of course they are, but the ground realities are very harsh. With the nation in an impoverished condition, the people are not taking it too kindly as the Brasil government has bowed down to all the demands of FIFA including tax exemption to the tune of more than 270 million dollars. A Brazil public safety law which prohibited alcohol consumption in stadiums too was turned down because one of the alcohol beverage company was one of the official sponsors of the World Cup. When can I watch the World Cup?Â  For us in India, the World Cup starts like everyone else from tomorrow. But, with the drastically different time zones, the games will unfortunately be telecasted from midnight to dawn, with kickoffs at 12.30 AM, 1.30 AM, 3.30 AM and 6.30 AM. For the people who cannot stay awake even for this, breathe easy -as there are indeed a couple of matches at primetime which is 9.30 PM. For the complete TV Guide to the World Cup look here.Â  Why does the World Cup have an official ball?Â  Since 1970 Adidas has been an official sponsor for FIFA in World Cups and part of this is they get to name the official match ball in the Cup. For the last World Cup, it was christened Jabulani and this time it is Brazuca, the first ball to have its name was chosen by the fans. An interesting fact with regards to the Brazuca, is that the ball was manufactured close to home, by Forward Sports in Sialkot, Pakistan.Â 	sports
Messi fooled by Ronaldinho lookalike - Goal.com	The Argentina attacker was met by a pitch invader he momentarily took for his former Barcelona team-mate in the Albiceleste's training session on Wednesday By Ben Hayward in Belo Horizonte Lionel Messi was taken by surprise duringÂ  Argentina's training session on Wednesday by a pitch invader he briefly mistook for his former Barcelona team-mate and friend Ronaldinho. Argentina trained in front of thousands of fans and press at Belo Horizonte's Estadio Independencia, where Ronaldinho regularly turns out for Atletico Mineiro. After some light running, the Albiceleste squad were divided into small groups for games of football-tennis in a low-key session which finished amid chaos as over a dozen supporters climbed over the fences to invade the pitch and ran in search of a handshake or a hug from their heroes. Most headed in Messi's direction and security guards were overwhelmed in their attempts to halt the fans as the practice was quickly brought to an abrupt end. But the Argentine was initially fooled by the Ronaldinho double. Robinson Oliveira, who works as a professional lookalike of the Brazilian forward, told Goal: "When he saw me he was shocked because he thought I was the real Ronaldinho and he told me that I didn't need to run on the pitch to see him. "He said: 'What are you doing running on here to see me?' When he held my hand, I went down on my knees [and bowed]. It was so emotional." He added: "I didn't plan this. I just thought to myself that I have to hold his hand because this is the only opportunity I will have to see him." The lookalike, who bears an uncanny resemblance to the former Barca hero, ended up with a bloodied hand after scaling the fence in his adventure to meet Messi, but said: "It was worth it." Asked which of the two players he prefers, he replied: "Ronaldinho, of course!" Argentina and Messi kick off their World Cup campaign against Bosnia at the Maracana on Sunday.	sports

'My mission isn't finished' - Blatter to stand for re-election - Goal.com	Despite severe criticism from high-profile figures in football and calls for him to stand down, the leader of world football's governing body says he will stand for election again Sepp Blatter will stand for re-election as Fifa president after the organisation voted against term and age limits for officials. The 78-year-old's widely anticipated announcement that he is to pursue a fifth term in office comes amid a tumultuous week personally in the build-up to the World Cup in Brazil. Blatter branded UK newspaper reports of fresh corruption allegations relating to the voting process for the hosting of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar as racist, bringing sustained criticism from leading figures in Uefa and across European football. Yet, despite this groundswell of continental ill-feeling against Blatter, the vote at the Fifa Congress to reject limits on the age of officials and the lengths of term they can serve demonstrated the widespread support he retains across world football's governing body. Welcomed to the stage with applause as he made his closing remarks in Sao Paulo, Blatter said: "I know that my mandate will finish next year on 29 May in Zurich. But my mission is not finished. "And I tell you together we will build the new Fifa together. We have the foundations today because we have the budget for the next four years. "We have the foundation, now we work. Congress, you will decide who takes this great institution forward. "But I can tell you I am ready to accompany you in the future." Jerome Champagne, whose confirmed candidacy for the Fifa presidency in 2015 has won high-profile support in the form of Pele, made a prompt statement in response to Blatter's announcement. It read: "For the past years and in particular since I declared my candidacy on January 20, 2014 in London, I have been defending the need of a genuine, respectful and fair-play debate on all issues affecting Fifa and football in the 21st century. "Moreover, in any democratic organisation, the election of its president is about vision, programmes and manifestos. No one should fear this open discussion in front of the people of football, which would honour those organising and conducting it." Blatter, meanwhile, also suggested football could follow in the footsteps of cricket by allowing managers two challenges to officials' decisions per game by reviewing instant television replays of contentious incidents - a major departure from his previous caution over introducing greater technology into football. "We could do something more on the field of play," Blatter said. "Why don't we give team managers the possibility of two challenges for refereeing during the match? If the manager disagrees with a decision why should he not ask for an immediate TV review with the referee?" Blatter did sound a far less polarising tone earlier in the day when he called for stronger action to be taken to curb racism in world football. He said: "We must impose the toughest punishment to send a clear message. Suspension and empty stadia is not enough. As coming out of the resoution of last year, we should be docking points, expelling teams, or relegating them. This would be an example for all the others."	sports

'We know how to stop Brazil' - Kovac - Goal.com	The Eastern Europeans meet the tournament hosts to kick off the tournament and the coach is adamant his side can get something from the game Croatia coach Niko Kovac says his team know what they have to do to stop Brazil and Neymar when they meet in the opening match of the World Cup. The two sides kick off the tournament on Thursday at the Corinthians Arena with Brazil the favourites to win the match and the competition outright. But Kovac insists it will be no easy task for Luiz Felipe Scolari's men and says his team are capable of handling them. "We know how to stop Neymar and Brazil," Kovac said at his press conference. "Brazil is not only Neymar - they have a great team, but Croatia also have excellent players. "All those in the team know how nice it is to play for Croatia and how much we love our people. We will leave our heart on the field." The teams last met in the 2006 World Cup in Germany, with Brazil winning 1-0, but Kovac says his side will fight for a good result against the five-time world champions and vowed to attack throughout the game. The coach continued: "In Berlin, we were not able to surprise them, but we will give our best. No surrender - we will attack Brazil! Just as we did in the Serbia friendly.Â Possession is very important because Brazilians do not like to run for the ball." Croatia captain Dario Srna also vowed to make it difficult for the South American hosts, insisting they will make their fans proud of them. "I cannot promise that we'll go get a group win or beat Brazil, but we'll give every ounce of energy," he said. " It is a big day for us.Â  All Croatians will be proud.Â  "The pitch is great and our preparation wentÂ great, the conditions in the camp are excellent, arriving in Sao Paulo went without problems.Â  "Fernandinho and Willian are my friends.Â We agree that Brazil is the favourite, but they will not find it easy."	sports

Van Persie, Robben and Sneijder are a real threat, admits Martinez - Goal.com	The Spain international admits his side have to be wary of the Dutch trio and says they are desperate to win their opening game of the tournament Spain midfielder Javi Martinez has highlighted Netherlands attackers Robin van Persie, Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder as a real threat to his side's chances in their World Cup opener on Friday. The two teams meet in a replay of the 2010 final, in which an Andres Iniesta goal in extra time clinched the trophy for the Spaniards after Arjen Robben had missed a glorious opportunity on the hour mark. And Martinez believes the reigning European and world champions will have to be wary of his Bayern team-mate along with Van Persie and Sneijder in the re-match. "Their biggest threat are their front three, who are all world class," he told reporters. "Robben is excellent at drifting into space and we will have to watch out for that." The 25-year-old says he has spoken to Robben about that missed chance four years ago. Martinez continued: "We have talked about it in the past couple of years. It was a bitter blow for Holland and him personally. "We've spoken about that match and the one-on-ones against Iker a fair few times. Before the 2013 Champions League final I told him not to blow his opportunity to make amends and he didn't." Martinez believes there is extra pressure on Spain to win their opening game in such a tight group which also consists of Chile and Australia. "After losing our first game last time round, the onus is on us not to do the same thing again," he said. "We showed that it isn't the be-all and end-all in South Africa, but getting off to a good start gives you extra confidence, even though we ended up as champions four years ago." The former Athletic Bilbao player also reflected on last year's Confederations Cup defeat to Brazil, the tournament hosts who are rated as favourites to win this year's tournament. "Brazil were more aggressive than us," conceded Martinez. "We were outclassed and it was a wake-up call. If we're not up for every match, anyone can beat us."	sports
Van Persie, Robben and Sneijder are a real threat, admits Martinez - Goal.com	The Spain international admits his side have to be wary of the Dutch trio and says they are desperate to win their opening game of the tournament Spain midfielder Javi Martinez has highlighted Netherlands attackers Robin van Persie, Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder as a real threat to his side's chances in their World Cup opener on Friday. The two teams meet in a replay of the 2010 final, in which an Andres Iniesta goal in extra time clinched the trophy for the Spaniards after Arjen Robben had missed a glorious opportunity on the hour mark. And Martinez believes the reigning European and world champions will have to be wary of his Bayern team-mate along with Van Persie and Sneijder in the re-match. "Their biggest threat are their front three, who are all world class," he told reporters. "Robben is excellent at drifting into space and we will have to watch out for that." The 25-year-old says he has spoken to Robben about that missed chance four years ago. Martinez continued: "We have talked about it in the past couple of years. It was a bitter blow for Holland and him personally. "We've spoken about that match and the one-on-ones against Iker a fair few times. Before the 2013 Champions League final I told him not to blow his opportunity to make amends and he didn't."

Chelsea boss Mourinho rules out Hazard exit - Goal.com	The Portuguese has no intention of letting the Belgian leave west London despite claiming that he was "not ready to sacrifice himself 100 per cent for the team" last term Jose Mourinho has dismissed speculation surrounding Eden Hazard's future, declaring that the Belgian will not be allowed to leave Chelsea this summer. The 23-year-old had been heavily linked with French champions Paris Saint-Germain, with Laurent Blanc publicly expressing interest in the attacker, though Hazard has since said he is certain to remain in London. And Mourinho, despite having been critical of Hazard during last season's Premier League run-in, has now confirmed that he has no intention of letting the former Lille man leave Stamford Bridge. "Just because I say that Eden does not have everything, it doesn't mean I don't want him," the Portuguese told L'Equipe. "He has fantastic potential and will express it at Chelsea. For him, as for others, the door is closed. People who know me know that, when I say that, I mean it." Hazard was Chelsea's top scorer in the Premier League last season, netting 14 times, while he also made seven assists. Though the west Londoners have already sold David Luiz to PSG, as well as releasing Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole, Hazard is highly unlikely to join them in leaving Chelsea and is in the process of sealing a contract extension. "I am staying at Chelsea, [that is] 100 per cent sure," he told Le Derniere Heure on Monday. "I am in discussions with Chelsea for a new contract. "It is only the beginning of the talks right now so we have got time but the fact that Chelsea have offered me a new deal means that they have got a lot of confidence in me that I can do a good job and that they can count on me."	sports

Pirlo: Italy must be careful against improving England - Goal.com	The veteran Juventus midfielder says that the Azzurri "know how to face" Saturday's Group D opponents, though he urges caution against the Three Lions' young, fast starlets Italy midfielder Andrea Pirlo has warned his team-mates that they can expect to face a different and much-improved England side than the one whom they sent crashing out of Euro 2012. The two sides meet in Manaus on Saturday in their opening game of the World Cup, a repeat of their quarter-final clash two years ago in Kiev, in which the Azzurri progressed after a penalty shootout. But Pirlo is not taking the Three Lions' threat lightly, highlighting the emergence of youth within England's ranks, though he is confident that Cesare Prandelli's men are capable of coming out on top. "We know England are a good team that has improved a lot," he told reporters. "They have new, young players, who are fast. We will have to be careful. "However, we know how to face them. Italy have always played great games against England and hence we will have our chances." Pirlo was instrumental in Italy's victory over England in Ukraine, famously completing more passes than Roy Hodgson's entire midfield combined, but he insists that the four-time World Cup winners are more than a one-man team. "This national team is not Pirlo-dependent," the 35-year-old argued. "In order to go all the way you need everyone's contribution. "Our aim should be to win and go until the end. We have a very competitive team and we will give our all to win this tournament. I never compete to take part but to finish first."	sports

I want to replicate PSG success with Milan - Menez - Goal.com	The France international says Pippo Inzaghi's outfit have the ability in their squad to challenge at the top again following a difficult 2013-14 campaign Jeremy Menez says he wants to have the same success with AC Milan that he enjoyed with Paris Saint-Germain. The France international joined PSG from Roma in 2011 and has since won two consecutive Ligue 1 titles and reached the Champions League quarter-finals in each of the last two seasons. The 27-year-old attacker arrived in Italy on Wednesday to undergo a medical ahead of his proposed move to the San Siro giants, and told reporters he is keen to repeat his experiences in the French capital upon donning the Milan shirt. "I'm very happy, I want to win with this shirt as I did with PSG," he admitted after landing in Lombardy. "Why Milan? Because it's a big team, not just a big club. I really hope to do well." Menez returns to Italy to become new coach Filippo Inzaghi's first signing as the club attempt to put a disappointing 2013-14 campaign behind them. But having previously spent three years with Roma before his transfer to Paris three years ago, he insists that he will show on the field of play just how his game has progressed since his last spell in Serie A. "Differences between this Menez and the old one? You will see on the pitch. Compared to four years ago, I have grown a lot and I want to prove it on the field." Menez spent Wednesday evening dining with Milan CEO Adriano Galliani and will undergo a medical at the club's Milanello complex on Thursday ahead of signing a â¬4.5 million-a-year, three-year deal.	sports

England can't handle the World Cup pressure, says Vialli - Goal.com	The former Chelsea player and manager feels that the Three Lions have a habit of crumbling at major tournaments, though he acknowledges that they could pose Italy problems Gianluca Vialli believes ItalyÂ will handle the pressure of the World CupÂ better than Group D rivals England. The 49-year-old, who was at Chelsea for four years before later managing Watford, thinks that players who do well in the Premier League find it hard to cope with the expectation at major international tournaments. With the Azzurri first up for the Three Lions in Manaus on Saturday, Vialli is confident that his nation will be in better shape, claiming that they "eat pressure for breakfast". He told Perform: "I think it's quite funny with England because, for about four years, all the England fans and the England players feel a bit depressed and disillusioned when it comes to the England side and then, one month before the World Cup starts, everybody sort of starts feeling that they [will] naturally win it and everybody feels super-confident. "I think that England fans should try to find a balance in between both state of minds but I think the England players find it quite difficult when they play in the World Cup because they are not used to the pressure. "When they play in the Premiership, when they play Manchester United versus Chelsea, for example, or Arsenal, there's no pressure; it's actually quite fun to play. "You know that there are no consequences if you don't do well, as long as you do your best on the pitch, and therefore, when they play for the national team, when they wear the England shirt, all of a sudden they realise they are representing their country. They feel there is a massive expectation, there's a lot of scrutiny and a lot of consequences. "It's the inability to handle the pressure that makes a big difference between between the Italian players and the England players when it comes to the World Cup stage. "The Italian players, they eat pressure for breakfast so they grow up with a lot of pressure and they know how to handle it. "Also [Italy] are very good at winning games even though we are not playing at our best, which is something that England players need to learn quite fast if they want to succeed in the World Cup because there will be one or two games where you will not be performing so you need to be able to win it anyway. Historically we are very good at that." Although Vialli is not convinced by England's ability to perform under intense pressure, he acknowledges that they are more than capable of posing a threat on Saturday. "I think England are a very exciting side because they have got so many young, talented, creative players playing up front," he added. "The likes of [Daniel] Sturridge, [Wayne] Rooney, and [Raheem] Sterling, [Adam] Lallana, [Danny] Welbeck, they can turn hot quickly and can create problems for the opposition. "They need to be a bit more clinical, though, because there won't be many goalscoring opportunities so they need to take their chances when they can."	sports

Beating Brazil in the final would be like an orgasm, says Maradona - Goal.com	The 53-year-old says he would love to see his country beat their South American rivals in the final and told Pele to go 'back to the museum' Argentina legend Diego Maradona claims that beating hosts and bitter rivals Brazil in the World Cup final would be "like an orgasm". Maradona, who famously helped guide his country to World Cup glory in 1986, believes Alejandro Sabella's men should be aiming to at least reach the final at Maracana on July 13.Â  Both Argentina and Brazil are among the tournament favourites, but Sabella's side will first have to escape Group F, which also contains debutants Bosnia-Herzegovina, Iran and Nigeria. If Argentina were to reach the final and subsequently pip five-time world champions Brazil to the title, Maradona has no doubts that it would be the perfect victory. The 53-year-old toldÂ Diario Ole: "Hopefully they can do it [reach the final]. The target will be to reach that point. "There, Argentina can open up against Brazil, who will surely be in the final. To beat Brazil in the final would be like an orgasm." The former Barcelona and Napoli star also continued his long-standing feud with Brazil legend Pele before dismissing comparisons between Neymar and Lionel Messi. "How have I been received in Brazil? Better than Pele, although that is not saying much," he continued. "You can tell Pele to go back to the museum. It's clear that the distance between Messi and Neymar is the same between Maradona and Pele. "Neymar is today's Pele. In Brazil he is bigger, everyone is looking to him as the great figure of Brazilian football." Maradona also believes Messi will be able to hit his best form for Argentina this year, something he hasn't done at a major international tournament as of yet. "If an individual inspires the team with his brilliance, it helps immensely," he wrote in Times of India.Â "That is why I believe the presence of Messi and Ronaldo will help Argentina and Portugal play better. "These two are the best of this generation and both are yet to play at the best of their abilities in the biggest tournament."	sports

Italy playmaker Andrea Pirlo confident ahead of England World Cup 2014 clash - Telegraph	It is little wonder, then, that there is talk of Hodgson specifically adapting his formation to deal with the unique threat of a playmaker who operates so far behind the main striker. Pirlo is confident that the Italian midfield will simply use their movement to ensure that any man-marking strategy would be doomed to failure. Italy tested out a 4-1-3-1-1 formation during their training session on Wednesday and have been constantly tweaking their system during the build-up matches. Daniele De Rossi and Marco Verratti are expected to start but the one certainty is that manager Cesare Prandelli will give Pirlo the freedom to influence the game however he sees fit. âWe tried this new solution with a midfielder in front of the defence and two further forward with more freedom,â said Pirlo. âWe aim to rotate the midfield positions to keep our opponents guessing. "We like this option, it can give great results and we are working to improve every day. We can try many different approaches but it is also down to how you interpret the role. In truth itâs a system that involves rotation, as we go forward and at other times Iâd come back into the more classic position.â Italyâs form in the warm-up matches will have prompted few alarm bells with England. True, they found their goalscoring touch in dispatching Fluminense 5-3 on Sunday but were winless in six previously during a sequence that even included an embarrassing 1-1 draw with Luxembourg. Pirlo was part of the Italy team that won the 2006 World Cup and he is still adamant that a repeat is possible. He also dismissed questions about his own elite status and the suggestion that Italy had become dependent upon him. âI was never interested in being a world star,â he said. âI think about enjoying - you journalists make the world stars. No. We are 23 players at the disposal of the coach and know to go all the way we need a contribution from everyone, as we learned in 2006. âCan Italy win the World Cup? Of course. When I play, it is solely to win. I am never just content with getting through the round. We have a competitive squad and will give our all to achieve this objective. We have the chance to make this a World Cup to be remembered for all our lives. We have what it takes to go far. The important thing is to believe, sacrifice ourselves, work hard and the results can arrive.â That process begins on Saturday, with Pirlo hinting that he could yet renege on a previous plan to retire from international football after this World Cup. At 35, his hunger to keep playing in club football was underlined on Wednesday by confirmation of a new two-year contract at Juventus. âI intend to quit international football after this World Cup but if I am needed...â said Pirlo. âI am still thinking of retiring, as I have a certain age and itâs only right to leave the field to the next generation coming through. It would be pointless to continue. âIf I am needed, then thereâs no problem in coming back. But if I come on international duty and donât play, then Iâd get angry. So itâs perhaps better I stay home.â It was a mercurial answer but typical of the one player who adds fantasy to an Italy team that still lack a certain flair. In his recent autobiography, Pirlo made a point of acknowledging how Juninho Pernambucano had inspired his free-kick technique and the former Brazil midfielder was even a guest on Wednesday at Casa Azzurri. âPirlo is a demon, he not only copied my shot but improved it - if I was still playing Iâd ask him to teach me,â said Juninho. Pirlo digested the compliment, gratefully accepted a Brazil shirt with his name on it and then delivered an even better sound-bite of his own. âJuninho was very kind to me, we were both emotional,â he said. âIâm Italian, but Iâm also part Brazilian - Pirlinho, if you like.â	sports
Neymar: I had a Ronaldo haircut in 2002 - Goal.com	Il Fenomeno made headlines for his appearance as much as his on-field heroics in Japan and South Korea, but the Barcelona star admits he mimicked the look of his idol By Kris Voakes in Sao Paulo Neymar has revealed he sported the same outrageous hairstyle as Ronaldo during Brazil's triumphant 2002 World Cup campaign. Ronaldo notched eight goals - including two in the final against Germany - to finish clear at the top of the scoring charts in Japan and South Korea, but made as many headlines for his appearance as his on-field heroics. The former Real Madrid striker shaved off all his hair except a section at the front, with the look since regularly topping lists of the worst haircuts in football history. But Neymar admits his admiration for Il Fenomeno prompted him to follow suit during the tournament, even though he claims he has forgotten most of the context of Brazil's fifth World Cup victory. "In 2002, I had a haircut like Ronaldo's but I don't remember much," he told reporters at a press conference in Sao Paulo ahead of Thursday's tournament opener against Croatia. "I remember celebrating. "Romario and Ronaldo are the two star players that I always think of when we talk about World Cups, especially 2002. "I get inspiration from all players all over the world, players like Messi and Ronaldo, but I hope to follow my path together with my team."	sports

Wayne Rooney says he has no excuses with England at World Cup 2014 - Telegraph	âMaybe you guys, the media, have put me under a lot of pressure and Iâve tried to respond to that. This time I havenât and Iâm not going to. Iâm going to enjoy it. Iâm excited for this tournament. Iâm enjoying working with the younger lads and the experienced lads. I really believe we can do well. âIâve learnt to enjoy this one because I havenât enjoyed the last ones, theyâve not gone well. All of a sudden youâre looking back and theyâve gone and I didnât enjoy it. Iâm going to make sure I take positive memories from this one. I hope so. I know the last tournaments havenât gone well for me and, if this one doesnât, Iâll have no excuses. Iâve prepared well for it.ââ Rooney is certainly better prepared than at the 2010 World Cup when he railed against England fans in Cape Town after their dissent towards a dreadful display against Algeria. âI regret that. It was the heat of the moment and it happened, and you move on. Listen, Iâll do my best for England and Iâm sure the fans see that. All fans have favourite players. Iâm sure the English Man United fans like me! It was stupid of me but it was a frustrating time. âThe hardest thing about last time was I missed my family, and this time Iâve learnt to deal with that. Of course I miss them. Theyâll be over here eventually. Not with me but they will be. To be honest, itâs good to get a few daysâ rest!â Rooney has two sons, aged four and one, and the elder is beginning to note the focus on his father. âFor instance, towards the end of last season, when I walked out at Old Trafford the fans were shouting and he was asking why. Heâs not a massive football fan. Heâs not really into it at the minute. Heâs still young. Iâm sure, in time, itâll come.â As well as the maturing effects of fatherhood, Rooneyâs equanimity has been helped by talking to the sports psychologist, Dr Steve Peters, who is travelling with England. âIâve spoken to him a few times. Heâs a great benefit for the team. I found him great and easy to talk to.ââ The tournament he enjoyed most was Euro 2004 when he was a teenager, playing without fear, just loving the occasion. âI did enjoy that one. I was doing well. Thatâs the good thing about the younger lads in the squad, like Ross [Barkley] and Raheem (Sterling). You can see that thereâs no fear with them. Theyâll be good players, big players for us.â He will tell them to âenjoy itâ, adding âYou have to enjoy the momentâ. Against Ecuador in the Miami friendly, when the focus was on him after injury and some travails in front of goal, Rooney celebrated wildly scoring from three yards. âOne yard!

They put themselves in good positions. But if Iâm being honest, when you play a high tempo theyâve struggled. The Italian league is nowhere near the tempo of the Premier League. Even when we played AC Milan, with [Alessandro] Nesta and [Paolo] Maldini the centre-halves, they really struggled when we played a high tempo. If we can do that I am sure we will give them problems.â Rooney believes England have that tempo. âWeâve got a lot of energy, a lot of pace in the team, and if we can pick the right moments we can really hurt teams with the pace and tempo that we can hit them at. But, at international football, you canât just go out there and attack, attack, attack. We have to be a bit cautious. This is the top end of football and you might get picked off. We have to stick to our plans that weâve worked on in the last few weeks and pick the right moment.â Italian defenders are also masters at the dark arts of baulking, checking, ensuring strikers are unable to get close to the ball. âThey are but everyone is learning that now; 10-15 years ago it was different but with the amount of foreign players in our league now, even English players are learning it now.ââ If England play against Italy as fluidly and intelligently as Rooney spoke yesterday, they might just have a chance. - Paul Hayward: Prepare for a joyous, nerve-shredding, ludicrous drama - Alan Hansen: Brazil were the best team I faced - I bared had a kick - Manaus groundsman: Pitch for England's game is in poor shape	sports
Wayne Rooney says he has no excuses with England at World Cup 2014 - Telegraph	âMaybe you guys, the media, have put me under a lot of pressure and Iâve tried to respond to that. This time I havenât and Iâm not going to. Iâm going to enjoy it. Iâm excited for this tournament. Iâm enjoying working with the younger lads and the experienced lads. I really believe we can do well. âIâve learnt to enjoy this one because I havenât enjoyed the last ones, theyâve not gone well. All of a sudden youâre looking back and theyâve gone and I didnât enjoy it. Iâm going to make sure I take positive memories from this one. I hope so. I know the last tournaments havenât gone well for me and, if this one doesnât, Iâll have no excuses. Iâve prepared well for it.ââ Rooney is certainly better prepared than at the 2010 World Cup when he railed against England fans in Cape Town after their dissent towards a dreadful display against Algeria. âI regret that. It was the heat of the moment and it happened, and you move on. Listen, Iâll do my best for England and Iâm sure the fans see that. All fans have favourite players. Iâm sure the English Man United fans like me! It was stupid of me but it was a frustrating time. âThe hardest thing about last time was I missed my family, and this time Iâve learnt to deal with that. Of course I miss them. Theyâll be over here eventually. Not with me but they will be. To be honest, itâs good to get a few daysâ rest!â Rooney has two sons, aged four and one, and the elder is beginning to note the focus on his father. âFor instance, towards the end of last season, when I walked out at Old Trafford the fans were shouting and he was asking why. Heâs not a massive football fan. Heâs not really into it at the minute. Heâs still young. Iâm sure, in time, itâll come.â As well as the maturing effects of fatherhood, Rooneyâs equanimity has been helped by talking to the sports psychologist, Dr Steve Peters, who is travelling with England. âIâve spoken to him a few times. Heâs a great benefit for the team. I found him great and easy to talk to.ââ The tournament he enjoyed most was Euro 2004 when he was a teenager, playing without fear, just loving the occasion. âI did enjoy that one. I was doing well. Thatâs the good thing about the younger lads in the squad, like Ross [Barkley] and Raheem (Sterling). You can see that thereâs no fear with them. Theyâll be good players, big players for us.â He will tell them to âenjoy itâ, adding âYou have to enjoy the momentâ. Against Ecuador in the Miami friendly, when the focus was on him after injury and some travails in front of goal, Rooney celebrated wildly scoring from three yards. âOne yard!

Guilherme Siqueira excited by Atletico Madrid challenge - Goal.com	The left-back joined the Spanish champions from Granada on Wednesday and says he didn't even take a second to think about joining the club Guilherme Siqueira revealed that he wasted no time in deciding to joinÂ Atletico Madrid after finalising his move on Wednesday. The Spanish champions have struck a deal with Granada for the left-back, who agreed a four-year contract at Vicente Calderon last week and has now been unveiled in the capital after passing his medical.Â  The 28-year-old, who spent last season on loan at Europa League finalists Benfica,Â says he didn't hesitate to accept Atletico's offer and hopes the success they achieved this season can be sustained for a long period of time. "Today is an unforgettable day.Â I'm happy and excited," he said at his unveiling. "It is an important day because I can already say that I am at the Liga champions. "Of course. That's what we're working towards. We don't speak about a season here, but a cycle."Â  The defender added that he is looking forward to joining the team and praised coach Diego Simeone for the work he has done with the club. "This Atletico team is impressive, watching the team is a pleasure.Â One of the strengths of this group is physical fitness. Atleti are stronger at the latter stages of the league campaign than others. "Any player would want to be part of this group, it did not take a second to decide once I knew they were interested." "The boss has been doing an amazing job. Watching Atletico play is a joy. The project here is about results. Any footballer would want to be a part of this club. "I haven't spoken to him yet, let him enjoy his holidays, but there's not much to say, you can see what Atleti are about. I really like the idea of playing each game as if it were your last. I hope to settle in as quickly as possible."	sports
Italy playmaker Andrea Pirlo confident ahead of England World Cup 2014 clash - Telegraph	It is little wonder, then, that there is talk of Hodgson specifically adapting his formation to deal with the unique threat of a playmaker who operates so far behind the main striker. Pirlo is confident that the Italian midfield will simply use their movement to ensure that any man-marking strategy would be doomed to failure. Italy tested out a 4-1-3-1-1 formation during their training session on Wednesday and have been constantly tweaking their system during the build-up matches. Daniele De Rossi and Marco Verratti are expected to start but the one certainty is that manager Cesare Prandelli will give Pirlo the freedom to influence the game however he sees fit. âWe tried this new solution with a midfielder in front of the defence and two further forward with more freedom,â said Pirlo. âWe aim to rotate the midfield positions to keep our opponents guessing. "We like this option, it can give great results and we are working to improve every day. We can try many different approaches but it is also down to how you interpret the role. In truth itâs a system that involves rotation, as we go forward and at other times Iâd come back into the more classic position.â Italyâs form in the warm-up matches will have prompted few alarm bells with England. True, they found their goalscoring touch in dispatching Fluminense 5-3 on Sunday but were winless in six previously during a sequence that even included an embarrassing 1-1 draw with Luxembourg. Pirlo was part of the Italy team that won the 2006 World Cup and he is still adamant that a repeat is possible. He also dismissed questions about his own elite status and the suggestion that Italy had become dependent upon him. âI was never interested in being a world star,â he said. âI think about enjoying - you journalists make the world stars. No. We are 23 players at the disposal of the coach and know to go all the way we need a contribution from everyone, as we learned in 2006. âCan Italy win the World Cup? Of course. When I play, it is solely to win. I am never just content with getting through the round. We have a competitive squad and will give our all to achieve this objective. We have the chance to make this a World Cup to be remembered for all our lives. We have what it takes to go far. The important thing is to believe, sacrifice ourselves, work hard and the results can arrive.â That process begins on Saturday, with Pirlo hinting that he could yet renege on a previous plan to retire from international football after this World Cup. At 35, his hunger to keep playing in club football was underlined on Wednesday by confirmation of a new two-year contract at Juventus. âI intend to quit international football after this World Cup but if I am needed...â said Pirlo. âI am still thinking of retiring, as I have a certain age and itâs only right to leave the field to the next generation coming through. It would be pointless to continue. âIf I am needed, then thereâs no problem in coming back. But if I come on international duty and donât play, then Iâd get angry. So itâs perhaps better I stay home.â It was a mercurial answer but typical of the one player who adds fantasy to an Italy team that still lack a certain flair. In his recent autobiography, Pirlo made a point of acknowledging how Juninho Pernambucano had inspired his free-kick technique and the former Brazil midfielder was even a guest on Wednesday at Casa Azzurri. âPirlo is a demon, he not only copied my shot but improved it - if I was still playing Iâd ask him to teach me,â said Juninho. Pirlo digested the compliment, gratefully accepted a Brazil shirt with his name on it and then delivered an even better sound-bite of his own. âJuninho was very kind to me, we were both emotional,â he said. âIâm Italian, but Iâm also part Brazilian - Pirlinho, if you like.â	sports

Scolari: Current Brazil side as good as Ronaldo's 2002 champions - Goal.com	Host nation are well placed to repeat their success in South Korea and Japan, according to their coach, who oversaw the talents of Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and Rivaldo at that event By Kris Voakes at the Arena Corinthians, Sao Paulo Luiz Felipe Scolari says that his Brazil squad are âcollectively the sameâ as the team he led to World Cup victory in 2002. Speaking at the Arena Corinthians, where Brazil will kick-off the 2014 showpiece on Thursday against Croatia, the Selecao coach told the worldâs media that his current crop can emulate the Ronaldo-inspired success of 12 years ago. âI would say that this squad and the 2002 squad are collectively the same,â said Scolari. âThere was an ability in that squad which helped to change games tactically. âThis squad has players that change their games to help the team. For instance, Neymar helps to mark players if it helps the whole team." âBig Philâ added that he feels his troops are ready to fulfil the dreams of the entire host nation. "We want to thank president Dilma Rousseff for her words of support and also the fans from across the country who are backing us. âThe time has arrived, we are going together. This is our World Cup.â Scolari has been hit by the deaths of his brother-in-law and nephew in the build-up to the finals beginning, but he says that football has helped him to move forward as the World Cup approaches. âYes, we have gone through difficult times together, but life goes on,â he added. âWe do what we have to do and we go on. Each of us has a path to follow. âI find my strength from working with these players who dedicate themselves every day and are always trying to improve. All this helps us forget the sadness and see the beauty of what is happening around you.â Niko Kovacâs Croatia side are likely to give Brazil a tough test in their opening Group A fixture, and Scolari insists that he is focused entirely on the events of Thursday night. âI'm thinking only of tomorrow, because we have seven steps to take and we cannot jump the first of those steps. âWe have prepared well, we are all fit to play, and everything that was planned was excellentâ¦ I will sleep well tonight.â	sports
Pirlo: This World Cup will be my last - Goal.com	The midfielder made his international debut 12 years ago but admits he is unlikely to be available for the national team after the tournament in Brazil Andrea Pirlo has admitted he plans to retire from international duty after this World Cup unless he is desperately needed by Italy. The midfielder has been a member of the national team since 2002 and lifted the 2006 World Cup as well as reaching the Euro 2012 final with the Azzurri. After 12 years of service, the 35-year-old is ready to bring an end to his international career unless Cesare Prandelli is struggling for options if he is not available for selection. "I'm still thinking of retiring after this World Cup, as I have reached a certain age and it is only right to leave the pitch to the generation coming through," the Juventus star told reporters. "It would be pointless to continue. If I am needed, then thereâs no problem in coming back. If I come on international duty and donât play, then Iâd get angry. It is perhaps better I stay home." Pirlo was then asked about Mario Balotelli and he believes the striker's goal drought will come to an end soon. The Juventus star said: "Strikers score goals, so when they donât come then perhaps he gets a little upset, but he just needs to focus on playing for the team and then a goal will arrive as a consequence of that. "It is the dream of every player to be at a World Cup in Brazil, the nation of football. Itâs not something that happens often, so we have the chance to make this a World Cup to be remembered for all our lives." Italy are without a win in seven matches as they prepare to face Costa Rica, England and Uruguay in the group stage.Â 	sports

Iâm ready for this tournament.ââ He did not particularly appreciate the critical comments from his former team-mate, Paul Scholes, about his having peaked as a player. âI donât agree with it. Iâm sure heâs upset a lot of people at Man United because they see me as worthy of signing a new deal at the club, so they obviously have got a different opinion to what Paul has.ââ Unlike Jack Wilshere, another victim of Scholesâs new role as a pugnacious pundit, Rooney has not bothered to contact Scholes. âIâve never had his phone number and heâs never had mine,ââ said Rooney, giving an insight into how private a person Scholes was at Old Trafford. âHeâs been a great player at Man United, probably the best player Iâve ever played with, so Iâm not going to knock him as a player, but I donât agree with his point.â Handling criticism goes with the territory of being Englandâs most-scrutinised, most high-profile player. âIâve always responded well in the dressing room if Iâm not doing well and if someone is shouting at me. I have no problem with that. You can see some players it really affects them. Itâs not something I get concerned with.â At the start of the season, the then United manager David Moyes suggested that Rooney had gone âsoftâ. The pair discussed this. âHe didnât call me in. I went to see him. He felt I had lost a bit of aggression out of my game â which I was asked to do, by the way. He said he wanted me to find that aggression back. It [his discipline] was blown up after the sending off against Montenegro [in 2011]. Before that my record in terms of discipline and bookings wasnât that bad. I was asked to stop doing that â stupid tackles. âMaybe I was trying to do too much. I thought about it a lot. It wasnât really me. Maybe there are times when you have to try and lift the crowd with a tackle, obviously not a stupid one. A run back and tackle can lift the fans and even turn a game round.â His thoughts now turn to Italy on Saturday. In training at Urca yesterday, Rooney played central, having started left against Honduras. âIâm happy to play anywhere,ââ he said. âBut if you look at the way we play, itâs not out and out on the left wing. Youâre playing more inside, youâre coming inside off the line. Whoever is playing Noâ10, wide or up top, the manager [Roy Hodgson] gives us the freedom to rotate.ââ He knows the Italians will be a test. âThe Italian defenders Iâve played against tend to read the game really well. They put themselves in good positions. But if Iâm being honest, when you play a high tempo theyâve struggled. The Italian league is nowhere near the tempo of the Premier League. Even when we played AC Milan, with [Alessandro] Nesta and [Paolo] Maldini the centre-halves, they really struggled when we played a high tempo. If we can do that I am sure we will give them problems.â Rooney believes England have that tempo. âWeâve got a lot of energy, a lot of pace in the team, and if we can pick the right moments we can really hurt teams with the pace and tempo that we can hit them at. But, at international football, you canât just go out there and attack, attack, attack. We have to be a bit cautious. This is the top end of football and you might get picked off. We have to stick to our plans that weâve worked on in the last few weeks and pick the right moment.â Italian defenders are also masters at the dark arts of baulking, checking, ensuring strikers are unable to get close to the ball. âThey are but everyone is learning that now; 10-15 years ago it was different but with the amount of foreign players in our league now, even English players are learning it now.ââ If England play against Italy as fluidly and intelligently as Rooney spoke yesterday, they might just have a chance. - Paul Hayward: Prepare for a joyous, nerve-shredding, ludicrous drama - Alan Hansen: Brazil were the best team I faced - I bared had a kick - Manaus groundsman: Pitch for England's game is in poor shape	sports

Pirlo: This World Cup will be my last - Goal.com	The midfielder made his international debut 12 years ago but admits he is unlikely to be available for the national team after the tournament in Brazil Andrea Pirlo has admitted he plans to retire from international duty after this World Cup unless he is desperately needed by Italy. The midfielder has been a member of the national team since 2002 and lifted the 2006 World Cup as well as reaching the Euro 2012 final with the Azzurri. After 12 years of service, the 35-year-old is ready to bring an end to his international career unless Cesare Prandelli is struggling for options if he is not available for selection. "I'm still thinking of retiring after this World Cup, as I have reached a certain age and it is only right to leave the pitch to the generation coming through," the Juventus star told reporters. "It would be pointless to continue. If I am needed, then thereâs no problem in coming back. If I come on international duty and donât play, then Iâd get angry. It is perhaps better I stay home." Pirlo was then asked about Mario Balotelli and he believes the striker's goal drought will come to an end soon. The Juventus star said: "Strikers score goals, so when they donât come then perhaps he gets a little upset, but he just needs to focus on playing for the team and then a goal will arrive as a consequence of that. "It is the dream of every player to be at a World Cup in Brazil, the nation of football. Itâs not something that happens often, so we have the chance to make this a World Cup to be remembered for all our lives." Italy are without a win in seven matches as they prepare to face Costa Rica, England and Uruguay in the group stage.Â 	sports

Scolari: Current Brazil side as good as Ronaldo's 2002 champions - Goal.com	Host nation are well placed to repeat their success in South Korea and Japan, according to their coach, who oversaw the talents of Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and Rivaldo at that event By Kris Voakes at the Arena Corinthians, Sao Paulo Luiz Felipe Scolari says that his Brazil squad are âcollectively the sameâ as the team he led to World Cup victory in 2002.

The Bayern Munich keeper has been struggling with a shoulder injury in recent weeks, but Kopke has allayed any fears that he will miss their Group G fixture on Monday, June 16. "Manuel's going to train fully today so that he can get a feel for his shoulder," Kopke said. "Things are going in the right direction for him. Manuel is experienced enough and we're constantly discussing how his shoulder feels. "It's not the case that he doesn't have faith in it. Manuel is fully fit." Neuer's understudy Roman Weidenfeller played in Germany's last two warm-up games - a 2-2 draw with Cameron and a 6-1 thrashing of Armenia - and Kopke insists there is no problem between the two keepers as they battle it out for the number one jersey. "You've got to have a great team spirit," he said. "Roman has said himself that there is no point in arguing about who should be number one. "He would be ready to play at any time, but he knows the overall situation. The players are pushing each other to greater things with their performances."	sports

Mexico are due to face Cameroon on Friday in what is scheduled to be the first match held at the stadium. While Secopa (Extraordinary Secretary for World Cup Related Subjects) has guaranteed that the stadium is all but finished, the fire department responsible for signing the order of release for the use of the site disagree. According to firefighters, there should have been a safety inspection of the site on Tuesday, but they were not authorised to make their visit, meaning that the stadium is yet to be cleared to host matches. The Arena de Sao Paulo, the stadium scheduled to host the opening game of the tournament between Brazil and Croatia on Thursday, faced similar issues. The Sao Paulo firefighters department refused to sign off on its temporary seating, which led to Fifa recalling a number of sold tickets. Fans that acquired seats in that part of the stadium were forced to exchange their purchased seats for those situated in other areas of the stadium, causing the capacity to fall from around 68,000 to little over 60,000.	sports

Croatia star Ivan Rakitic excited by 'dream' Barcelona switch - Goal.com	The Croatia international has expressed his delight as he edges closer to completing a move to Camp Nou from the Europa League winners Sevilla midfielder Ivan Rakitic is revelling in a "dream come true" as he looks set to seal a switch to La Liga giants Barcelona. The 26-year-old is expected to move to Camp Nou after he has represented Croatia at the World Cup, with his performances during Sevilla's Europa League victory last season having caught the eye of several of Europe's biggest clubs. And Rakitic is thrilled to be on the verge of a move to the Catalan outfit, who are looking to rebuild their squad after missing out on the Liga, Champions League and Copa del Rey trophies last season. "I am very happy," Rakitic told Catalan newspaperÂ Sport.Â "It is a dream come true." Barcelona are believed to have agreed a deal in the region of â¬20 million for the Croatia international. Rakitic's arrival is expected to hasten the departure of Cesc Fabregas, with Premier League sides Chelsea,Â  Manchester Unitedand Manchester City all linked with the Spain midfielder's signature. Barcelona appointed Luis Enrique as head coach last month after parting company with Gerardo Martino, who lasted just one season at the helm.	sports

The Dutch lost 1-0 to Spain thanks to an extra-time Andres Iniesta goal at Soccer City in Johannesburg four years ago, after Robben missed what proved to be a pivotal one-on-one with Iker Casillas on the hour mark. But the 30-year-old says he has no regrets and canât wait for this weekend's big kick-off in Brazil. "A World Cup is always something special and I am very excited to be in Brazil for this one," he told Fifa.com. "South Africa was a really great tournament for me. It was obviously a big disappointment we lost the final, but I am still really proud of what we all achieved together at that tournament." The former Chelsea and Real Madrid star went on to say he was confident a young Dutch team can perform at the tournament, but conceded they are not among the favourites. "Experience is important, especially mentally. But on the pitch it is all about playing in the right way, doing what you have to do - and it doesnât matter if you are 22 or 32.

World Cup 2014: Sepp Blatterâs big idea: let managers put referees on the spot - Telegraph	That brought a smattering of applause, but not from members of Uefa, who queued up on Tuesday to tell Blatter to stand down. The revolt, led in part by Football Association chairman Greg Dyke, was branded by Blatter as âthe most disrespectful thing Iâve experienced in my entire lifeâ. Yet, it will not stop him clinging on to power, which he could do indefinitely after member associations voted against the principle of term limits being introduced for presidents and other executives. As well as calling for greater use of technology, Blatter even floated the idea of Fifa taking football to other planets. With not a whiff of irony considering the storm over its decision to award the 2022 tournament to Qatar, the Swiss said: âWe shall wonder if one day our game is played on another planet? Why not? Then we will have not only a World Cup we will have interplanetary competitions.â The Qatar vote is being looked into by Fifaâs chief investigator, who on Wednesday night vowed to examine evidence published by the British media in recent weeks before filing his report into allegations of corruption surrounding the 2010 vote. As revealed by Telegraph Sport on Wednesday, Michael J Garcia has asked The Sunday Times to provide him with the documents it obtained, which purportedly relate to Fifaâs controversial decision to hand the tournament to the Gulf State. Blatter this week claimed the investigations spearheaded by the Telegraph as being motivated by âracismâ, an outburst that saw him taken to task by Dyke. Garcia promised to take them seriously, despite concluding his own inquiries on Monday. The American said: âWhat we can do, and what we have done, including in response to recent reports, is request any materials others have that they believe would assist in our inquiry.â Insisting he would produce a âcomprehensiveâ report â expected late next month â he added: âWhat we cannot do and what I will not do is postpone indefinitely completing our work on the possibility someone may publish something we may not have seen.â The head of the investigatory chamber of Fifaâs ethics committee also warned that anyone who failed to cooperate with his investigation faced punishment. That could spell trouble for former executive committee member Franz Beckenbauer, the Germany legend who voted in 2010 but refused to meet with Garcia. The barrage of criticism aimed at Fifa over what Blatter dubbed âQatartgateâ continued on Wednesday when former FA chairman Lord Triesman accused it of acting like a âmafia familyâ. Triesman, the initial chairman of Englandâs doomed bid to host the 2018 World Cup who previously claimed four Fifa members sought bribes in return for votes said: âFifa, Iâm afraid, behaves like a mafia family.â He added of Blatterâs racism accusations: âDon Corleone, I believe, would have recognised the tactics and he probably would have admired them.â More accusations of âracismâ were levelled at the British media at congress on Wednesday by the head of the Congolese FA. There was also some shameless plugging of Fifaâs â¬23âmillion motion picture, United Passions, while Fifa announced plans to pay out Â£120âmillion in total bonuses to its national associations and confederations from its World Cup revenue of an estimated Â£2.7âbillion. Each of the 209 member countries will get Â£150,000 this month and should receive a further Â£300,000 early next year. The six continental bodies will get Â£1.5âmillion this month and should receive Â£2.7âmillion more next year.	sports

World Cup 2014: Prepare for joyous, nerve-shredding, ludicrous drama as Brazil's carnival begins - Telegraph	This is a World Cup that cannot shimmy around the problems of Brazilian life and society but still strives for what Socrates called âthe ludicrous and joyousâ drama of football between nations, watched by the world, in a narrative as broad and strong as the Amazon, which England will fly along to face Italy in Manaus on Saturday. Brazil are threatened on all sides by rich European countries who plunder their best players as well as their old enemy to the south, Argentina, plus the former colonial master â Cristiano Ronaldoâs Portugal. Ronaldo showed no sign of injury in Portugalâs 5-1 friendly win over the Republic of Ireland, and is now said to be billeted in a VIP suite where he can contemplate his private battle against Lionel Messi, whose vomiting problem has been the source of much curiosity. Messi, now 26, doubled-up again shortly after coming on in Argentinaâs last warm-up match and has thrown-up half a dozen times for club and country. âNerves,â says Argentinaâs coach Alejandro Sabella, whose forward line is the most potent at this World Cup. âI reckon that in these moments there is anxiety more than anything. Itâs difficult to remain calm.â The Ronaldo-Messi struggle for supremacy was not meant to be described in such malodorous terms, but at least Messiâs nausea tells us that todayâs one-man corporations still care about their work. Neymar, who now wears the sacred Noâ10 for Brazil, has these two to cope with on top of his countryâs expectations. Wayne Rooney, who was once compared to Pele by Sven-Goran Eriksson in one of his giddier moments, is another with a sword of judgment poised over his head. In two World Cups, Messi has scored only once, in a 6-0 win over Serbia in 2006, and the heat is on him to convert brilliance at Barcelona into something resembling Diego Maradonaâs majesty with Argentina. He is not without accomplices in this cross-border raid. Across the forward line Sabella can call on Gonzalo HiguaÃ­n, Sergio AgÃ¼ero, Ezequiel Lavezzi and Ãngel Di Maria, none of which is good news for Bosnia (the debutants), Iran or Nigeria, who make up Group F. These are not the only A-list strikers, but some are struggling for fitness as their opening games approach. Uruguayâs Luis SuÃ¡rez and Spainâs Diego Costa are among those walking the fine line between recovery and further breakdown. SuÃ¡rez, the Premier Leagueâs player of the year, underwent arthroscopic surgery on May 22 and trained on his own on Tuesday. Costa, from Lagarto in Brazil, was granted Spanish citizenship last year and could be in for a lively reception from the home crowds. The day before England play Italy on a pitch that looks in photographs like a jungle landing strip, the world and European champions Spain stage a rematch of the 2010 'karateâ final in Johannesburg, which Spain won at the expense of Holland, managed by Manchester Unitedâs autocrat in waiting, Louis van Gaal. Spain hunt a double double. They captured the 2008 and 2012 European Championships either side of their World Cup victory in South Africa, from which 16 members of the squad survive. Spain are foremost among those teams hoping to overturn the reality that all South American World Cups have been won by South American teams. Spainâs dominance of world football can be seen as a victory over the Brazilian talent production machine, to the extent that Scolariâs men all spoke of a huge psychological boost with their Confederations Cup win over Vicente del Bosqueâs team here last summer. Even Peleâs country had fallen prey to the notion of Spanish invincibility. Now this tournament offers a chance to restore their Noâ1 position after a six-year pageant of tikiâtaka-based play. This opening fixture is a chance to take almost sadistic pleasure in the sight of 23 footballers in the beautiful buttercup shirts of their land carry the hopes of 200 million Brazilians, with Neymar the dream catcher in chief. Carlos Alberto Parreira, coach of the 1994âwinning team in America, told reporters that the 22-year-old Neymarâs status as Brazilâs to craque (star) has piled pressure on the teamâs poster boy. âA craque can make a difference from one move to another, but itâs the team that wins,â said Parreira, who is now Brazilâs technical director. âLike Maradona, Romario, Pele and all the players who made stand-out World Cup performances, heâll win with a team behind him.â No host team meanwhile have ever lost an opening match. Brazil lift the World Cup curtain for the first time since their 2-1 win over Scotland at the Stade de France in 1998 and are closing in on La Hexa (a sixth win), two years before the 2016 Olympics drop another spaceship on the Brazilian economy, already reeling from the likely $12âbillion cost of staging this event. This week the Brazilian business magazine Isto E Dinheiro called Scolari the âchief executive of the sixth world titleâ, as if this World Cup were a commercial takeover rather than a hard-fought competition. Before the ball rolls off the centre circle at the mostly-finished stadium in Sao Paulo, Brazil is trapped between the old sense of entitlement and a blazing urge to reject Fifa and its own governmentâs extravagance. âThis is the strangest atmosphere Iâve ever witnessed in Brazil before a World Cup, as apprehension and apathy threaten the normal excitement,â the historian Antonio RisÃ©rio told The New York Times, who also reported that only 34 per cent of Brazilians think the economy will be improved by the four-week party. Arnaldo Bloch, a columnist with O Globo, wrote: âThat talk about the national team being the patrimony of Brazil, the affirmation of our identity and civility and cordiality â no one swallows that anymore.â But football is an opiate that usually finds a route round the body. As the marvellous Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano observed of the old culture: âBrazil has the most beautiful game in the world, made of hip feints, undulations of the torso and legs in flight, all of which came from capoeira, the warrior dance of black slaves, and from the joyful dances of big city slums. There are no right angles in Brazilian football, just as there are none in the Rio mountains.â Who will not look for surviving evidence of this culture when Thiago Silva leads the hosts up the tunnel here in Sao Paulo? However England fare against Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica, English viewers will have little difficulty identifying with Scolariâs outfit. A former Chelsea manager himself, he summoned six Premier League players, as well as Julio Cesar, the goalkeeper recently at Queens Park Rangers. David Luiz, Oscar, Ramires and Willian from Chelsea join Manchester Cityâs Fernandinho and Paulinho of Spurs in Brazilâs 23-man home guard. This pattern is repeated across the tournament, where 110 Premier League players will represent 26 of the 32 countries. Only Burnley and West Ham United from Englandâs top flight are without a single player in Brazil. Chelsea lead the way with 17. Beaten in the last World Cup quarter-finals by France (2006) and Holland (2010), Brazil seek their first win since 2002 in Yokohama, when the three Rs of Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho overwhelmed a Germany side now under intense pressure to convert promise into hard metal. Ronaldoâs goalscoring record is under threat from Germanyâs Miroslav Klose, a functional finisher by comparison, who needs one more to match the Brazilian Ronaldoâs 15. Others edge towards landmarks. Spanâs Iker Casillas has kept seven clean sheets in 15 World Cup finals matches and is three shy of the record of 10 held by Peter Shilton and Fabien Barthez. With one more blockade, Casillas will also pass Walter Zengaâs 1990 record of 517 minutes unbeaten. Algeria seek to avoid a place in history rather than grab one. Failure to score against Belgium in Belo Horizonte would render them the first country to go six successive World Cup games without a goal. At the other end of the glamour scale, JÃ¼rgen Klinsmann (the US coach) and Didier Deschamps (France) endeavour to join Brazilâs Mario Zagallo and Germanyâs Franz Beckenbauer as the only men to have won World Cups as a player and a manager. Only Vittori Pozzo has won two trophies as a coach (with Italy in 1934 and 1938). Scolari or Del Bosque could take equal rank in the final in Rio de Janeiro on July 13. Despite all their talent and player development system, Germany have not won a trophy since Euro 96 in England. They were runners-up at Euro 2008 and third in the 2006 and 2010 World Cups. At Euro 2012 they were undone by Italy and Mario Balotelli in a game that was seen by many as a near-formality for the Nationalmannschaft. Five days before their game with Portugal in Salvador, Germany were embroiled in a row with 11 locals in the Santo Andre community over excessive security near their base. âWe had wanted to ride by bike to our training ground everyday, but unfortunately this is not possible, because the police donât allow it,â Oliver Bierhoff, Germanyâs team manager, complained. The numbers say that in World Cup history 76 teams have played 772 games involving 6,598 players in 19 runnings of the event. This 20th staging lifts Brazil out of the sepia of 1950 and asks huge questions of the countryâs infrastructure, government, economy and treatment of its own people, who have plenty of justifications for their grievances. Fifa announced on the eve of the opening ceremony that its 209 national member associations and six regional confederations will be paid bonuses totalling $200âmillion (Â£119âmillion) as revenue projections for Brazil 2014 shot up from $3.8âbillion (Â£2.3âbillion) to $4.5âbillion (Â£2.7âbillion). These handsâouts are 40 per cent higher than in South Africa four years ago. Lord Triesman, the former Football Association chairman, alleged: âFifa, Iâm afraid, behaves like a mafia family. It has a decades-long tradition of bribes, bungs and corruption.â Brazilâs president Dilma Rousseff, tortured by the military junta in the early 1970s, portrayed her country as one striving for greater fairness. âIâm certain visitors will mix with a happy, generous and hospitable people, and be impressed by a nation full of natural beauty and which fights each day to become more equal,â she said. There are other kinds of fighting, too. In the first reported case of fan-on-fan violence, an Argentine supporterâs finger was broken when three Brazilians tried to rip a flag from his hands in Belo Horizonte. At a dream final of Argentina v Brazil just over four weeks from now, the chap with the broken finger can gain his revenge, especially if Messi can become the king of his continent ahead of Neymar. - Wayne Rooney: This time I have no excuses for failing to perform - Alan Hansen: Brazil were the best team I faced - I bared had a kick - Manaus groundsman: Pitch for England's game is in poor shape	sports

Rooney: I have massive role to play for England - Goal.com	The Manchester United star's place in Roy Hodgson's starting XI has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks but he remains adamant he can be integral to the team By Greg Stobart in Rio de Janeiro Wayne RooneyÂ insists he still has a "massive" role to play in an EnglandÂ squad he considers the best he has played in. The Manchester United striker has found his place in the side under scrutiny ahead of Saturdayâs World Cup opener against Italy in Manaus, particularly after he was criticised by former team-mate Paul Scholes. Rooney has never scored in eight World Cup appearances but is adamant that he can lead Englandâs attack in Brazil this summer as an integral part of Roy Hodgsonâs youthful squad. âThe future is bright, thereâs so much ability in the team,â Rooney said in a press conference at Englandâs training base in Urca. âThe younger players are bringing a lot of energy and excitement to the team. Itâs probably the best squad Iâve been a part of with England. âItâs a joy to be a part of. I still feel I have a massive role to play in the team.â Rooney revealed that team-mate Danny Welbeck will be fit to face Italy on Satuday despite missing training on Wednesday with a thigh problem sustained on Tuesday. And the 28-year-old reckons Italy should be worried about stopping England in the Amazon jungle, despite the Three Lionsâ quarter-finals defeat to the Azzurri on penalties at Euro 2012. âDanny [Welbeck] will be fine, Iâm sure he will be ready for Saturday. Heâs just not risked anything today. âItaly should be thinking about how to control our team. They have good players but so do we. They should worry about us. âThe target is to try and win the tournament. Thatâs what weâve prepared to do. Itâs obviously a different set up to 2006 and 2010 but the goal is the same, which is to win it.â	sports
Mesut Ozil says Germany want to win World Cup for Joachim Low - Goal.com	The Arsenal midfielder says claiming the trophy would be a fitting tribute to a coach who has revolutionised the national team Germany midfielder Mezut Ozil says he is desperate to win the World Cup for coach Joachim Low. Germany have arrived in Brazil seeking their fourth world title and were handed a tough Group G draw featuring Portugal, Ghana and USA. The former Real Madrid man says he and his team-mates are desperate to claim the crown as a thank you to Low, who Ozil says has revolutionised the national team during his spell in charge. âHe's introduced a totally new German national team - one that is really respected all over the world,â Ozil told the official Arsenal club website. âWherever we go, I think opponents are reluctant to play us because we are very strong. If you look at the German team over the last couple of years, you can see that we have continuously played excellent football.â Low, 54, took charge of the side following World Cup 2006 and finished runners-up at Euro 2008 before making it to the semi-finals of both World Cup 2010 and Euro 2012. And Ozil is keen to go a step further in Brazil this month. â[Low] is one of the best in the world and we're happy to have him around the team. âI hope he will finally be rewarded because in the past we've lost in the semi-finals or final and to lose when you are so close is always sad.â	sports
World Cup 2014: Prepare for joyous, nerve-shredding, ludicrous drama as Brazil's carnival begins - Telegraph	This is a World Cup that cannot shimmy around the problems of Brazilian life and society but still strives for what Socrates called âthe ludicrous and joyousâ drama of football between nations, watched by the world, in a narrative as broad and strong as the Amazon, which England will fly along to face Italy in Manaus on Saturday. Brazil are threatened on all sides by rich European countries who plunder their best players as well as their old enemy to the south, Argentina, plus the former colonial master â Cristiano Ronaldoâs Portugal. Ronaldo showed no sign of injury in Portugalâs 5-1 friendly win over the Republic of Ireland, and is now said to be billeted in a VIP suite where he can contemplate his private battle against Lionel Messi, whose vomiting problem has been the source of much curiosity. Messi, now 26, doubled-up again shortly after coming on in Argentinaâs last warm-up match and has thrown-up half a dozen times for club and country. âNerves,â says Argentinaâs coach Alejandro Sabella, whose forward line is the most potent at this World Cup. âI reckon that in these moments there is anxiety more than anything. Itâs difficult to remain calm.â The Ronaldo-Messi struggle for supremacy was not meant to be described in such malodorous terms, but at least Messiâs nausea tells us that todayâs one-man corporations still care about their work. Neymar, who now wears the sacred Noâ10 for Brazil, has these two to cope with on top of his countryâs expectations. Wayne Rooney, who was once compared to Pele by Sven-Goran Eriksson in one of his giddier moments, is another with a sword of judgment poised over his head. In two World Cups, Messi has scored only once, in a 6-0 win over Serbia in 2006, and the heat is on him to convert brilliance at Barcelona into something resembling Diego Maradonaâs majesty with Argentina. He is not without accomplices in this cross-border raid. Across the forward line Sabella can call on Gonzalo HiguaÃ­n, Sergio AgÃ¼ero, Ezequiel Lavezzi and Ãngel Di Maria, none of which is good news for Bosnia (the debutants), Iran or Nigeria, who make up Group F. These are not the only A-list strikers, but some are struggling for fitness as their opening games approach. Uruguayâs Luis SuÃ¡rez and Spainâs Diego Costa are among those walking the fine line between recovery and further breakdown. SuÃ¡rez, the Premier Leagueâs player of the year, underwent arthroscopic surgery on May 22 and trained on his own on Tuesday. Costa, from Lagarto in Brazil, was granted Spanish citizenship last year and could be in for a lively reception from the home crowds. The day before England play Italy on a pitch that looks in photographs like a jungle landing strip, the world and European champions Spain stage a rematch of the 2010 'karateâ final in Johannesburg, which Spain won at the expense of Holland, managed by Manchester Unitedâs autocrat in waiting, Louis van Gaal. Spain hunt a double double. They captured the 2008 and 2012 European Championships either side of their World Cup victory in South Africa, from which 16 members of the squad survive. Spain are foremost among those teams hoping to overturn the reality that all South American World Cups have been won by South American teams. Spainâs dominance of world football can be seen as a victory over the Brazilian talent production machine, to the extent that Scolariâs men all spoke of a huge psychological boost with their Confederations Cup win over Vicente del Bosqueâs team here last summer. Even Peleâs country had fallen prey to the notion of Spanish invincibility. Now this tournament offers a chance to restore their Noâ1 position after a six-year pageant of tikiâtaka-based play. This opening fixture is a chance to take almost sadistic pleasure in the sight of 23 footballers in the beautiful buttercup shirts of their land carry the hopes of 200 million Brazilians, with Neymar the dream catcher in chief. Carlos Alberto Parreira, coach of the 1994âwinning team in America, told reporters that the 22-year-old Neymarâs status as Brazilâs to craque (star) has piled pressure on the teamâs poster boy. âA craque can make a difference from one move to another, but itâs the team that wins,â said Parreira, who is now Brazilâs technical director. âLike Maradona, Romario, Pele and all the players who made stand-out World Cup performances, heâll win with a team behind him.â No host team meanwhile have ever lost an opening match. Brazil lift the World Cup curtain for the first time since their 2-1 win over Scotland at the Stade de France in 1998 and are closing in on La Hexa (a sixth win), two years before the 2016 Olympics drop another spaceship on the Brazilian economy, already reeling from the likely $12âbillion cost of staging this event. This week the Brazilian business magazine Isto E Dinheiro called Scolari the âchief executive of the sixth world titleâ, as if this World Cup were a commercial takeover rather than a hard-fought competition. Before the ball rolls off the centre circle at the mostly-finished stadium in Sao Paulo, Brazil is trapped between the old sense of entitlement and a blazing urge to reject Fifa and its own governmentâs extravagance. âThis is the strangest atmosphere Iâve ever witnessed in Brazil before a World Cup, as apprehension and apathy threaten the normal excitement,â the historian Antonio RisÃ©rio told The New York Times, who also reported that only 34 per cent of Brazilians think the economy will be improved by the four-week party. Arnaldo Bloch, a columnist with O Globo, wrote: âThat talk about the national team being the patrimony of Brazil, the affirmation of our identity and civility and cordiality â no one swallows that anymore.â But football is an opiate that usually finds a route round the body. As the marvellous Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano observed of the old culture: âBrazil has the most beautiful game in the world, made of hip feints, undulations of the torso and legs in flight, all of which came from capoeira, the warrior dance of black slaves, and from the joyful dances of big city slums. There are no right angles in Brazilian football, just as there are none in the Rio mountains.â Who will not look for surviving evidence of this culture when Thiago Silva leads the hosts up the tunnel here in Sao Paulo? However England fare against Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica, English viewers will have little difficulty identifying with Scolariâs outfit. A former Chelsea manager himself, he summoned six Premier League players, as well as Julio Cesar, the goalkeeper recently at Queens Park Rangers. David Luiz, Oscar, Ramires and Willian from Chelsea join Manchester Cityâs Fernandinho and Paulinho of Spurs in Brazilâs 23-man home guard. This pattern is repeated across the tournament, where 110 Premier League players will represent 26 of the 32 countries. Only Burnley and West Ham United from Englandâs top flight are without a single player in Brazil. Chelsea lead the way with 17. Beaten in the last World Cup quarter-finals by France (2006) and Holland (2010), Brazil seek their first win since 2002 in Yokohama, when the three Rs of Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho overwhelmed a Germany side now under intense pressure to convert promise into hard metal. Ronaldoâs goalscoring record is under threat from Germanyâs Miroslav Klose, a functional finisher by comparison, who needs one more to match the Brazilian Ronaldoâs 15. Others edge towards landmarks. Spanâs Iker Casillas has kept seven clean sheets in 15 World Cup finals matches and is three shy of the record of 10 held by Peter Shilton and Fabien Barthez. With one more blockade, Casillas will also pass Walter Zengaâs 1990 record of 517 minutes unbeaten. Algeria seek to avoid a place in history rather than grab one. Failure to score against Belgium in Belo Horizonte would render them the first country to go six successive World Cup games without a goal. At the other end of the glamour scale, JÃ¼rgen Klinsmann (the US coach) and Didier Deschamps (France) endeavour to join Brazilâs Mario Zagallo and Germanyâs Franz Beckenbauer as the only men to have won World Cups as a player and a manager. Only Vittori Pozzo has won two trophies as a coach (with Italy in 1934 and 1938). Scolari or Del Bosque could take equal rank in the final in Rio de Janeiro on July 13. Despite all their talent and player development system, Germany have not won a trophy since Euro 96 in England. They were runners-up at Euro 2008 and third in the 2006 and 2010 World Cups. At Euro 2012 they were undone by Italy and Mario Balotelli in a game that was seen by many as a near-formality for the Nationalmannschaft. Five days before their game with Portugal in Salvador, Germany were embroiled in a row with 11 locals in the Santo Andre community over excessive security near their base. âWe had wanted to ride by bike to our training ground everyday, but unfortunately this is not possible, because the police donât allow it,â Oliver Bierhoff, Germanyâs team manager, complained. The numbers say that in World Cup history 76 teams have played 772 games involving 6,598 players in 19 runnings of the event. This 20th staging lifts Brazil out of the sepia of 1950 and asks huge questions of the countryâs infrastructure, government, economy and treatment of its own people, who have plenty of justifications for their grievances. Fifa announced on the eve of the opening ceremony that its 209 national member associations and six regional confederations will be paid bonuses totalling $200âmillion (Â£119âmillion) as revenue projections for Brazil 2014 shot up from $3.8âbillion (Â£2.3âbillion) to $4.5âbillion (Â£2.7âbillion). These handsâouts are 40 per cent higher than in South Africa four years ago. Lord Triesman, the former Football Association chairman, alleged: âFifa, Iâm afraid, behaves like a mafia family. It has a decades-long tradition of bribes, bungs and corruption.â Brazilâs president Dilma Rousseff, tortured by the military junta in the early 1970s, portrayed her country as one striving for greater fairness. âIâm certain visitors will mix with a happy, generous and hospitable people, and be impressed by a nation full of natural beauty and which fights each day to become more equal,â she said. There are other kinds of fighting, too. In the first reported case of fan-on-fan violence, an Argentine supporterâs finger was broken when three Brazilians tried to rip a flag from his hands in Belo Horizonte. At a dream final of Argentina v Brazil just over four weeks from now, the chap with the broken finger can gain his revenge, especially if Messi can become the king of his continent ahead of Neymar. - Wayne Rooney: This time I have no excuses for failing to perform - Alan Hansen: Brazil were the best team I faced - I bared had a kick - Manaus groundsman: Pitch for England's game is in poor shape	sports
Manuel Neuer fit for Germany's World Cup opener with Portugal - Goal.com	The Bayern Munich shot stopper has been struggling with a shoulder injury but the goalkeeper coach insists he is fully fit to feature on Monday Manuel Neuer will be fit for Germany's World Cup opener with Portugal, according to goalkeeper coach Andreas Kopke. The Bayern Munich keeper has been struggling with a shoulder injury in recent weeks, but Kopke has allayed any fears that he will miss their Group G fixture on Monday, June 16. "Manuel's going to train fully today so that he can get a feel for his shoulder," Kopke said. "Things are going in the right direction for him. Manuel is experienced enough and we're constantly discussing how his shoulder feels. "It's not the case that he doesn't have faith in it. Manuel is fully fit." Neuer's understudy Roman Weidenfeller played in Germany's last two warm-up games - a 2-2 draw with Cameron and a 6-1 thrashing of Armenia - and Kopke insists there is no problem between the two keepers as they battle it out for the number one jersey. "You've got to have a great team spirit," he said. "Roman has said himself that there is no point in arguing about who should be number one. "He would be ready to play at any time, but he knows the overall situation. The players are pushing each other to greater things with their performances."	sports
Rooney: I have massive role to play for England - Goal.com	The Manchester United star's place in Roy Hodgson's starting XI has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks but he remains adamant he can be integral to the team By Greg Stobart in Rio de Janeiro Wayne RooneyÂ insists he still has a "massive" role to play in an EnglandÂ squad he considers the best he has played in. The Manchester United striker has found his place in the side under scrutiny ahead of Saturdayâs World Cup opener against Italy in Manaus, particularly after he was criticised by former team-mate Paul Scholes. Rooney has never scored in eight World Cup appearances but is adamant that he can lead Englandâs attack in Brazil this summer as an integral part of Roy Hodgsonâs youthful squad. âThe future is bright, thereâs so much ability in the team,â Rooney said in a press conference at Englandâs training base in Urca. âThe younger players are bringing a lot of energy and excitement to the team. Itâs probably the best squad Iâve been a part of with England. âItâs a joy to be a part of. I still feel I have a massive role to play in the team.â Rooney revealed that team-mate Danny Welbeck will be fit to face Italy on Satuday despite missing training on Wednesday with a thigh problem sustained on Tuesday. And the 28-year-old reckons Italy should be worried about stopping England in the Amazon jungle, despite the Three Lionsâ quarter-finals defeat to the Azzurri on penalties at Euro 2012. âDanny [Welbeck] will be fine, Iâm sure he will be ready for Saturday. Heâs just not risked anything today. âItaly should be thinking about how to control our team. They have good players but so do we. They should worry about us. âThe target is to try and win the tournament. Thatâs what weâve prepared to do. Itâs obviously a different set up to 2006 and 2010 but the goal is the same, which is to win it.â	sports
Hearts euphoric as club finally exit administration a year after insolvency - Telegraph	Local businesswoman, Ann Budge, who agreed a deal with creditors to buy the club and install Craig Levein as director of football and Robbie Neilson as head coach, used the Hearts website to address the support in excited terms, when she said: âBy now, you will all have heard and, yes, itâs true, we have formally exited administration! âEveryone associated with the club is ecstatic and now we can really begin to move ahead in implementing our plans for the future. With the greatest respect to Bryan, Trevor, Bob and Duncan from BDO [Heartsâ administrators], we are all delighted to see them go! âOn a serious note, however, we owe them a huge thank-you for putting in the hours to get us out of administration this week, as promised. âSo what now? Well, the first thing is to get season tickets on sale as quickly as possible and the club will be issuing information regarding this tomorrow. âFollowing this, we will shortly be issuing information on new signings and more pre-season friendlies which, I know, is what all the fans are desperate to hear. âHowever, for today, letâs just celebrate the news!â Meanwhile, at Easter Road, the hunt for a replacement for Butcher has started, with Ian Murray favourite to get the job, despite speculation that the new Hibernian CEO, Leeann Dempster, would turn to Motherwell, the club she left to move to Edinburgh, in pursuit of Stuart McCall. Should Hibs move for Murray they will have to pay Dumbarton â whom he steered to fifth place in last seasonâs Championship, despite sparse resources â compensation for the two-year deal he agreed in May. Murray, who took over in 2012 and led Dumbarton to seventh place the following season, was linked with the St Mirren vacancy when Danny Lennon was sacked, but the Paisley board had already decided to appoint Lennonâs assistant, Tommy Craig. When he signed his new deal with Dumbarton, Murray said: âIâm glad everythingâs been sorted and we can get into the planning process for an exciting campaign next season.â However, with two spells as a Hibs player on his CV, it was inevitable that Murrayâs name would be touted as a possible successor to Butcher, and one that would be popular with many fans.	sports
Italy playmaker Andrea Pirlo confident ahead of England World Cup 2014 clash - Telegraph	It is little wonder, then, that there is talk of Hodgson specifically adapting his formation to deal with the unique threat of a playmaker who operates so far behind the main striker. Pirlo is confident that the Italian midfield will simply use their movement to ensure that any man-marking strategy would be doomed to failure. Italy tested out a 4-1-3-1-1 formation during their training session on Wednesday and have been constantly tweaking their system during the build-up matches. Daniele De Rossi and Marco Verratti are expected to start but the one certainty is that manager Cesare Prandelli will give Pirlo the freedom to influence the game however he sees fit. âWe tried this new solution with a midfielder in front of the defence and two further forward with more freedom,â said Pirlo. âWe aim to rotate the midfield positions to keep our opponents guessing. "We like this option, it can give great results and we are working to improve every day. We can try many different approaches but it is also down to how you interpret the role. In truth itâs a system that involves rotation, as we go forward and at other times Iâd come back into the more classic position.â Italyâs form in the warm-up matches will have prompted few alarm bells with England. True, they found their goalscoring touch in dispatching Fluminense 5-3 on Sunday but were winless in six previously during a sequence that even included an embarrassing 1-1 draw with Luxembourg. Pirlo was part of the Italy team that won the 2006 World Cup and he is still adamant that a repeat is possible. He also dismissed questions about his own elite status and the suggestion that Italy had become dependent upon him. âI was never interested in being a world star,â he said. âI think about enjoying - you journalists make the world stars. No. We are 23 players at the disposal of the coach and know to go all the way we need a contribution from everyone, as we learned in 2006. âCan Italy win the World Cup? Of course. When I play, it is solely to win. I am never just content with getting through the round. We have a competitive squad and will give our all to achieve this objective. We have the chance to make this a World Cup to be remembered for all our lives. We have what it takes to go far. The important thing is to believe, sacrifice ourselves, work hard and the results can arrive.â That process begins on Saturday, with Pirlo hinting that he could yet renege on a previous plan to retire from international football after this World Cup. At 35, his hunger to keep playing in club football was underlined on Wednesday by confirmation of a new two-year contract at Juventus. âI intend to quit international football after this World Cup but if I am needed...â said Pirlo. âI am still thinking of retiring, as I have a certain age and itâs only right to leave the field to the next generation coming through. It would be pointless to continue. âIf I am needed, then thereâs no problem in coming back. But if I come on international duty and donât play, then Iâd get angry. So itâs perhaps better I stay home.â It was a mercurial answer but typical of the one player who adds fantasy to an Italy team that still lack a certain flair. In his recent autobiography, Pirlo made a point of acknowledging how Juninho Pernambucano had inspired his free-kick technique and the former Brazil midfielder was even a guest on Wednesday at Casa Azzurri. âPirlo is a demon, he not only copied my shot but improved it - if I was still playing Iâd ask him to teach me,â said Juninho. Pirlo digested the compliment, gratefully accepted a Brazil shirt with his name on it and then delivered an even better sound-bite of his own. âJuninho was very kind to me, we were both emotional,â he said. âIâm Italian, but Iâm also part Brazilian - Pirlinho, if you like.â	sports
World Cup 2014: Sepp Blatterâs big idea: let managers put referees on the spot - Telegraph	That brought a smattering of applause, but not from members of Uefa, who queued up on Tuesday to tell Blatter to stand down. The revolt, led in part by Football Association chairman Greg Dyke, was branded by Blatter as âthe most disrespectful thing Iâve experienced in my entire lifeâ. Yet, it will not stop him clinging on to power, which he could do indefinitely after member associations voted against the principle of term limits being introduced for presidents and other executives. As well as calling for greater use of technology, Blatter even floated the idea of Fifa taking football to other planets. With not a whiff of irony considering the storm over its decision to award the 2022 tournament to Qatar, the Swiss said: âWe shall wonder if one day our game is played on another planet? Why not? Then we will have not only a World Cup we will have interplanetary competitions.â The Qatar vote is being looked into by Fifaâs chief investigator, who on Wednesday night vowed to examine evidence published by the British media in recent weeks before filing his report into allegations of corruption surrounding the 2010 vote. As revealed by Telegraph Sport on Wednesday, Michael J Garcia has asked The Sunday Times to provide him with the documents it obtained, which purportedly relate to Fifaâs controversial decision to hand the tournament to the Gulf State. Blatter this week claimed the investigations spearheaded by the Telegraph as being motivated by âracismâ, an outburst that saw him taken to task by Dyke. Garcia promised to take them seriously, despite concluding his own inquiries on Monday. The American said: âWhat we can do, and what we have done, including in response to recent reports, is request any materials others have that they believe would assist in our inquiry.â Insisting he would produce a âcomprehensiveâ report â expected late next month â he added: âWhat we cannot do and what I will not do is postpone indefinitely completing our work on the possibility someone may publish something we may not have seen.â The head of the investigatory chamber of Fifaâs ethics committee also warned that anyone who failed to cooperate with his investigation faced punishment. That could spell trouble for former executive committee member Franz Beckenbauer, the Germany legend who voted in 2010 but refused to meet with Garcia. The barrage of criticism aimed at Fifa over what Blatter dubbed âQatartgateâ continued on Wednesday when former FA chairman Lord Triesman accused it of acting like a âmafia familyâ. Triesman, the initial chairman of Englandâs doomed bid to host the 2018 World Cup who previously claimed four Fifa members sought bribes in return for votes said: âFifa, Iâm afraid, behaves like a mafia family.â He added of Blatterâs racism accusations: âDon Corleone, I believe, would have recognised the tactics and he probably would have admired them.â More accusations of âracismâ were levelled at the British media at congress on Wednesday by the head of the Congolese FA. There was also some shameless plugging of Fifaâs â¬23âmillion motion picture, United Passions, while Fifa announced plans to pay out Â£120âmillion in total bonuses to its national associations and confederations from its World Cup revenue of an estimated Â£2.7âbillion. Each of the 209 member countries will get Â£150,000 this month and should receive a further Â£300,000 early next year. The six continental bodies will get Â£1.5âmillion this month and should receive Â£2.7âmillion more next year.	sports

Miralem Pjanic says Bosnia-Herzegovina don't fear Argentina - Goal.com	The Roma star says his side possess the quality to challenge anyone on the biggest stage as they prepare for their World Cup opener on Sunday Miralem Pjanic has insisted Bosnia-Herzegovina have no fear of Argentina ahead of their World Cup clash on Sunday. Safet Susic's side go up against the South American giants in their opening match of Group F at the nation's first ever World Cup.Â  And despite the prospect of facing the likes of Lionel Messi and Sergio Aguero, playmaker Pjanic is confident that his country can give Argentina a run for their money.

Miralem Pjanic says Bosnia-Herzegovina don't fear Argentina - Goal.com	The Roma star says his side possess the quality to challenge anyone on the biggest stage as they prepare for their World Cup opener on Sunday Miralem Pjanic has insisted Bosnia-Herzegovina have no fear of Argentina ahead of their World Cup clash on Sunday. Safet Susic's side go up against the South American giants in their opening match of Group F at the nation's first ever World Cup.Â  And despite the prospect of facing the likes of Lionel Messi and Sergio Aguero, playmaker Pjanic is confident that his country can give Argentina a run for their money. "We will be against one of the favourites in Argentina, but we have the expertise to challenge them," he told Sky Sport 24 . "We do not fear anyone because we believe in our chances.

World Cup 2014: Prepare for joyous, nerve-shredding, ludicrous drama as Brazil's carnival begins - Telegraph	This is a World Cup that cannot shimmy around the problems of Brazilian life and society but still strives for what Socrates called âthe ludicrous and joyousâ drama of football between nations, watched by the world, in a narrative as broad and strong as the Amazon, which England will fly along to face Italy in Manaus on Saturday. Brazil are threatened on all sides by rich European countries who plunder their best players as well as their old enemy to the south, Argentina, plus the former colonial master â Cristiano Ronaldoâs Portugal. Ronaldo showed no sign of injury in Portugalâs 5-1 friendly win over the Republic of Ireland, and is now said to be billeted in a VIP suite where he can contemplate his private battle against Lionel Messi, whose vomiting problem has been the source of much curiosity. Messi, now 26, doubled-up again shortly after coming on in Argentinaâs last warm-up match and has thrown-up half a dozen times for club and country. âNerves,â says Argentinaâs coach Alejandro Sabella, whose forward line is the most potent at this World Cup. âI reckon that in these moments there is anxiety more than anything. Itâs difficult to remain calm.â The Ronaldo-Messi struggle for supremacy was not meant to be described in such malodorous terms, but at least Messiâs nausea tells us that todayâs one-man corporations still care about their work. Neymar, who now wears the sacred Noâ10 for Brazil, has these two to cope with on top of his countryâs expectations. Wayne Rooney, who was once compared to Pele by Sven-Goran Eriksson in one of his giddier moments, is another with a sword of judgment poised over his head. In two World Cups, Messi has scored only once, in a 6-0 win over Serbia in 2006, and the heat is on him to convert brilliance at Barcelona into something resembling Diego Maradonaâs majesty with Argentina. He is not without accomplices in this cross-border raid. Across the forward line Sabella can call on Gonzalo HiguaÃ­n, Sergio AgÃ¼ero, Ezequiel Lavezzi and Ãngel Di Maria, none of which is good news for Bosnia (the debutants), Iran or Nigeria, who make up Group F. These are not the only A-list strikers, but some are struggling for fitness as their opening games approach. Uruguayâs Luis SuÃ¡rez and Spainâs Diego Costa are among those walking the fine line between recovery and further breakdown. SuÃ¡rez, the Premier Leagueâs player of the year, underwent arthroscopic surgery on May 22 and trained on his own on Tuesday. Costa, from Lagarto in Brazil, was granted Spanish citizenship last year and could be in for a lively reception from the home crowds. The day before England play Italy on a pitch that looks in photographs like a jungle landing strip, the world and European champions Spain stage a rematch of the 2010 'karateâ final in Johannesburg, which Spain won at the expense of Holland, managed by Manchester Unitedâs autocrat in waiting, Louis van Gaal. Spain hunt a double double. They captured the 2008 and 2012 European Championships either side of their World Cup victory in South Africa, from which 16 members of the squad survive. Spain are foremost among those teams hoping to overturn the reality that all South American World Cups have been won by South American teams. Spainâs dominance of world football can be seen as a victory over the Brazilian talent production machine, to the extent that Scolariâs men all spoke of a huge psychological boost with their Confederations Cup win over Vicente del Bosqueâs team here last summer. Even Peleâs country had fallen prey to the notion of Spanish invincibility. Now this tournament offers a chance to restore their Noâ1 position after a six-year pageant of tikiâtaka-based play. This opening fixture is a chance to take almost sadistic pleasure in the sight of 23 footballers in the beautiful buttercup shirts of their land carry the hopes of 200 million Brazilians, with Neymar the dream catcher in chief. Carlos Alberto Parreira, coach of the 1994âwinning team in America, told reporters that the 22-year-old Neymarâs status as Brazilâs to craque (star) has piled pressure on the teamâs poster boy. âA craque can make a difference from one move to another, but itâs the team that wins,â said Parreira, who is now Brazilâs technical director. âLike Maradona, Romario, Pele and all the players who made stand-out World Cup performances, heâll win with a team behind him.â No host team meanwhile have ever lost an opening match. Brazil lift the World Cup curtain for the first time since their 2-1 win over Scotland at the Stade de France in 1998 and are closing in on La Hexa (a sixth win), two years before the 2016 Olympics drop another spaceship on the Brazilian economy, already reeling from the likely $12âbillion cost of staging this event. This week the Brazilian business magazine Isto E Dinheiro called Scolari the âchief executive of the sixth world titleâ, as if this World Cup were a commercial takeover rather than a hard-fought competition. Before the ball rolls off the centre circle at the mostly-finished stadium in Sao Paulo, Brazil is trapped between the old sense of entitlement and a blazing urge to reject Fifa and its own governmentâs extravagance. âThis is the strangest atmosphere Iâve ever witnessed in Brazil before a World Cup, as apprehension and apathy threaten the normal excitement,â the historian Antonio RisÃ©rio told The New York Times, who also reported that only 34 per cent of Brazilians think the economy will be improved by the four-week party. Arnaldo Bloch, a columnist with O Globo, wrote: âThat talk about the national team being the patrimony of Brazil, the affirmation of our identity and civility and cordiality â no one swallows that anymore.â But football is an opiate that usually finds a route round the body. As the marvellous Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano observed of the old culture: âBrazil has the most beautiful game in the world, made of hip feints, undulations of the torso and legs in flight, all of which came from capoeira, the warrior dance of black slaves, and from the joyful dances of big city slums. There are no right angles in Brazilian football, just as there are none in the Rio mountains.â Who will not look for surviving evidence of this culture when Thiago Silva leads the hosts up the tunnel here in Sao Paulo? However England fare against Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica, English viewers will have little difficulty identifying with Scolariâs outfit. A former Chelsea manager himself, he summoned six Premier League players, as well as Julio Cesar, the goalkeeper recently at Queens Park Rangers. David Luiz, Oscar, Ramires and Willian from Chelsea join Manchester Cityâs Fernandinho and Paulinho of Spurs in Brazilâs 23-man home guard. This pattern is repeated across the tournament, where 110 Premier League players will represent 26 of the 32 countries. Only Burnley and West Ham United from Englandâs top flight are without a single player in Brazil. Chelsea lead the way with 17. Beaten in the last World Cup quarter-finals by France (2006) and Holland (2010), Brazil seek their first win since 2002 in Yokohama, when the three Rs of Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho overwhelmed a Germany side now under intense pressure to convert promise into hard metal. Ronaldoâs goalscoring record is under threat from Germanyâs Miroslav Klose, a functional finisher by comparison, who needs one more to match the Brazilian Ronaldoâs 15. Others edge towards landmarks. Spanâs Iker Casillas has kept seven clean sheets in 15 World Cup finals matches and is three shy of the record of 10 held by Peter Shilton and Fabien Barthez. With one more blockade, Casillas will also pass Walter Zengaâs 1990 record of 517 minutes unbeaten. Algeria seek to avoid a place in history rather than grab one. Failure to score against Belgium in Belo Horizonte would render them the first country to go six successive World Cup games without a goal. At the other end of the glamour scale, JÃ¼rgen Klinsmann (the US coach) and Didier Deschamps (France) endeavour to join Brazilâs Mario Zagallo and Germanyâs Franz Beckenbauer as the only men to have won World Cups as a player and a manager. Only Vittori Pozzo has won two trophies as a coach (with Italy in 1934 and 1938). Scolari or Del Bosque could take equal rank in the final in Rio de Janeiro on July 13. Despite all their talent and player development system, Germany have not won a trophy since Euro 96 in England. They were runners-up at Euro 2008 and third in the 2006 and 2010 World Cups. At Euro 2012 they were undone by Italy and Mario Balotelli in a game that was seen by many as a near-formality for the Nationalmannschaft. Five days before their game with Portugal in Salvador, Germany were embroiled in a row with 11 locals in the Santo Andre community over excessive security near their base. âWe had wanted to ride by bike to our training ground everyday, but unfortunately this is not possible, because the police donât allow it,â Oliver Bierhoff, Germanyâs team manager, complained. The numbers say that in World Cup history 76 teams have played 772 games involving 6,598 players in 19 runnings of the event. This 20th staging lifts Brazil out of the sepia of 1950 and asks huge questions of the countryâs infrastructure, government, economy and treatment of its own people, who have plenty of justifications for their grievances. Fifa announced on the eve of the opening ceremony that its 209 national member associations and six regional confederations will be paid bonuses totalling $200âmillion (Â£119âmillion) as revenue projections for Brazil 2014 shot up from $3.8âbillion (Â£2.3âbillion) to $4.5âbillion (Â£2.7âbillion). These handsâouts are 40 per cent higher than in South Africa four years ago. Lord Triesman, the former Football Association chairman, alleged: âFifa, Iâm afraid, behaves like a mafia family. It has a decades-long tradition of bribes, bungs and corruption.â Brazilâs president Dilma Rousseff, tortured by the military junta in the early 1970s, portrayed her country as one striving for greater fairness. âIâm certain visitors will mix with a happy, generous and hospitable people, and be impressed by a nation full of natural beauty and which fights each day to become more equal,â she said. There are other kinds of fighting, too. In the first reported case of fan-on-fan violence, an Argentine supporterâs finger was broken when three Brazilians tried to rip a flag from his hands in Belo Horizonte. At a dream final of Argentina v Brazil just over four weeks from now, the chap with the broken finger can gain his revenge, especially if Messi can become the king of his continent ahead of Neymar. - Wayne Rooney: This time I have no excuses for failing to perform - Alan Hansen: Brazil were the best team I faced - I bared had a kick - Manaus groundsman: Pitch for England's game is in poor shape	sports
VIDEO: Blatter dances his troubles away - Goal.com	Despite being faced with calls for him to resign, the 78-year-old Swiss took the time to show he still has authority on the dance floor alongside Fernanda Lima The build-up to the 2014 World Cup has been tough for Sepp Blatter, with allegations of corruption rocking Fifa and calls for the Swiss official to stand down amidst concerns over whether Brazil will even be ready for the opening fixtures of the tournament this week. When faced by the media just one day before the competition, however, the 78-year-old seemed decidedly unperturbed, taking time out of his schedule of handing out awards to showcase his dance moves with Brazilian beauty Fernanda Lima. Having also spoken of his desire to see football played in an "inter-platenary competition" in future, Blatter's moves in Brazil were hardly out of this world, but it certainly proved he is willing to embrace the part atmosphere of football's greatest showpiece...	sports
Spain v Holland: We want revenge against Spain, says Wesley Sneijder - Telegraph	âIt felt very sour. That will always be my rock bottom. âWe were so close to penalties and that game was still there, but Iniesta scored just three minutes before the end of the extra time. âIt was a shame because we had beaten Brazil in the quarter-final, a night when we turned the whole game. âI scored twice. Two goals, one with my head, and a 1-0 deficit turned into a place in the semi-finals. âYou just felt at one point that we were going to win. And then the final against Spain just went wrong.â Spain go into Fridayâs fixture as favourites, with Van Gaalâs blend of experience and emerging youngsters expected to face a battle with Chile for the runners-up spot - and a potential second round clash with Brazil. Sneijder insists, however, that Holland can get the positive result they need against Spain to avoid a losing start to the tournament. âThis is a big week but it's only one game,â Sneijder said. âWe need a result against Spain. Thatâs the point. âWe may not have a top team, but we definitely have a chance to fight hard and we play compact and can switch the ball quickly. We have a chance.â With Guus Hiddink due to replace Manchester United-bound Van Gaal as coach following theWorld Cup, the Dutch team is expected to be rebuilt ahead of Euro 2016 in France. But Sneijder insists he is ready to prove in Brazil his ability to extend his international career to the next World Cup in Russia in 2018. âIâm very proud of my international career,â Sneijder said. âIâm not a captain, but still a leader. âThe team spirit is good, much better than two years ago (at Euro 2012) and I will do everything to keep it that way because that is important at a major tournament. I know that from experience. âThese are my sixth major finals but I will keep going. You will see me in four years.â Dutch winger Arjen Robben, whose training ground clash with defender Bruno Martins Indi earlier this week hinted at tensions within the squad, echoed Sneijderâs claims that Holland will test Spain by backing Van Gaalâs youngsters to impress in Salvador. âWe have a young team, but it is talented,â Robben told Fifa.com. âExperience is important, especially mentally. But on the pitch it is all about playing in the right way, doing what you have to do - and it doesnât matter if you are 22 or 32. You just have to do what is asked for. âThat said, in my opinion Brazil, Argentina, Spain and Germany are the favourites. It will be hard for us because we have to play a very tough group. âSpain are the reigning world and European champions, and two teams from Spain played this seasonâs Champions League final. That says it all. âChile also have a very strong team with really good players who want to play in an attacking way. âAnd Australia are physically strong. We have played a few matches against them and were never able to win. âBut our preparations have been going well so far and Iâm really happy we are in Brazil now. You can feel the tournament is about to start. âBrazil is one of the greatest football countries in the world - maybe the greatest - so it is fantastic the World Cup has been organised here.â	sports
Hearts euphoric as club finally exit administration a year after insolvency - Telegraph	Local businesswoman, Ann Budge, who agreed a deal with creditors to buy the club and install Craig Levein as director of football and Robbie Neilson as head coach, used the Hearts website to address the support in excited terms, when she said: âBy now, you will all have heard and, yes, itâs true, we have formally exited administration! âEveryone associated with the club is ecstatic and now we can really begin to move ahead in implementing our plans for the future. With the greatest respect to Bryan, Trevor, Bob and Duncan from BDO [Heartsâ administrators], we are all delighted to see them go! âOn a serious note, however, we owe them a huge thank-you for putting in the hours to get us out of administration this week, as promised. âSo what now? Well, the first thing is to get season tickets on sale as quickly as possible and the club will be issuing information regarding this tomorrow. âFollowing this, we will shortly be issuing information on new signings and more pre-season friendlies which, I know, is what all the fans are desperate to hear. âHowever, for today, letâs just celebrate the news!â Meanwhile, at Easter Road, the hunt for a replacement for Butcher has started, with Ian Murray favourite to get the job, despite speculation that the new Hibernian CEO, Leeann Dempster, would turn to Motherwell, the club she left to move to Edinburgh, in pursuit of Stuart McCall. Should Hibs move for Murray they will have to pay Dumbarton â whom he steered to fifth place in last seasonâs Championship, despite sparse resources â compensation for the two-year deal he agreed in May. Murray, who took over in 2012 and led Dumbarton to seventh place the following season, was linked with the St Mirren vacancy when Danny Lennon was sacked, but the Paisley board had already decided to appoint Lennonâs assistant, Tommy Craig. When he signed his new deal with Dumbarton, Murray said: âIâm glad everythingâs been sorted and we can get into the planning process for an exciting campaign next season.â However, with two spells as a Hibs player on his CV, it was inevitable that Murrayâs name would be touted as a possible successor to Butcher, and one that would be popular with many fans.	sports

Phil Jones feared for England World Cup place - Goal.com	The England defender took a heavy knock during Manchester United's 3-1 win over Hull in May but was included in Roy Hodgson's squad and is set to play in Brazil England defender Phil Jones has revealed that he feared for his World Cup prospects after injuring a shoulder at the end of last season. The 22-year-old sustained the injury in Manchester United's 3-1 win over Hull City last month, and it was initially feared he could be ruled out of the Brazilian showpiece. However, England boss Roy Hodgson included Jones in his 23-man squad and he played in the pre-tournament friendly against Ecuador last week. And the former Blackburn Rovers man has revealed he breathed a huge sigh of relief when he realised the injury was not going to prevent him from travelling to Brazil. "Once I did it (injured his shoulder) I thought I might not have a chance, but thankfully it healed quickly and I'm feeling fit, ready and I'm so looking forward to it," Jones told the FA's official website. "(The World Cup) was the first thing that came into my mind when I did it. "I remember getting the scan sitting there thinking 'it might knock my chance'. But, thankfully it's healed nicely and I'm able to be a part of what's going to hopefully be a successful tournament." Jones partnered club-mate Chris Smalling at the heart of England's defence in the 2-2 draw with Ecuador, and he was thrilled to get back on the pitch after a month out. "It was nice to get a start, it was a great game, competitive, it was what we wanted and it was great getting 90 minutes under my belt," he added. "It's been great, the lads were all really keen and excited to get out here and now we're here there's a real belief and buzz about the place. "It's building up to the first crucial game of the tournament. There has been an awful lot of work that has gone in behind the scenes which most people don't see. "Everyone is committed, we're in a tight group and everyone's pulling in the right direction for a successful campaign over here."	sports

Chelsea youngster Tomas Kalas joins Koln on loan - Goal.com	The Czech defender made two Premier League appearances for the Blues in 2013-14 but will continue his development at the newly-promoted Bundesliga club Chelsea defender Tomas Kalas will join newly promoted FC Koln on a season-long loan on July 1. The Czech, who has a solitary international cap to his name, spent two seasons on loan at Dutch outfit Vitesse Arnhem before returning to Stamford Bridge for the 2013-14 campaign. After being handed his Chelsea debut as a late substitute in a 2-0 League Cup win at Arsenal in October, Kalas made his European bow in a last-16 home triumph over Galatasaray. Kalas' first start for the club came in the huge 2-0 Premier League victory at Liverpool in April, and he was among the starting XI once again on the last day of the Premier League season at relegated Cardiff City. The 21-year-old will now be hoping to pick up more first-team experience as Koln adjust to life back in the Bundesliga, after topping the second tier last term. Kalas arrived at Chelsea from Sigma Olomouc in 2011.	sports

Phil Jones feared for England World Cup place - Goal.com	The England defender took a heavy knock during Manchester United's 3-1 win over Hull in May but was included in Roy Hodgson's squad and is set to play in Brazil England defender Phil Jones has revealed that he feared for his World Cup prospects after injuring a shoulder at the end of last season. The 22-year-old sustained the injury in Manchester United's 3-1 win over Hull City last month, and it was initially feared he could be ruled out of the Brazilian showpiece. However, England boss Roy Hodgson included Jones in his 23-man squad and he played in the pre-tournament friendly against Ecuador last week. And the former Blackburn Rovers man has revealed he breathed a huge sigh of relief when he realised the injury was not going to prevent him from travelling to Brazil. "Once I did it (injured his shoulder) I thought I might not have a chance, but thankfully it healed quickly and I'm feeling fit, ready and I'm so looking forward to it," Jones told the FA's official website. "(The World Cup) was the first thing that came into my mind when I did it. "I remember getting the scan sitting there thinking 'it might knock my chance'. But, thankfully it's healed nicely and I'm able to be a part of what's going to hopefully be a successful tournament." Jones partnered club-mate Chris Smalling at the heart of England's defence in the 2-2 draw with Ecuador, and he was thrilled to get back on the pitch after a month out. "It was nice to get a start, it was a great game, competitive, it was what we wanted and it was great getting 90 minutes under my belt," he added. "It's been great, the lads were all really keen and excited to get out here and now we're here there's a real belief and buzz about the place. "It's building up to the first crucial game of the tournament. There has been an awful lot of work that has gone in behind the scenes which most people don't see. "Everyone is committed, we're in a tight group and everyone's pulling in the right direction for a successful campaign over here."	sports

David Luiz reveals five-year deal with PSG - Goal.com	The 27-year-old claims he has agreed to leave Chelsea and play for the French champions for five seasons following this month's World Cup in Brazil Brazil defender David LuizÂ has revealed he has signed a five-year deal with French champions Paris Saint-Germain. His current club, Chelsea, and PSG both released statements on their official websites last month confirming that a deal Â - which Goal understands is worth â¬50 million -Â had been agreed. And now the 27-year-old, who is hoping to lead the Selecao to their sixth world title and their first on home soil, has confirmed he will be playing in Ligue 1 for the next five seasons. âI have just signed a deal with PSG for five years,â he told Globo when asked if he intends to one day play in Brazilâs top flight. âI left for Europe when I was 18, I skipped a few stepsâ¦ Weâll see. What we plan today may not be right tomorrow.â The Selecaoâs vice-captain also spoke of the demonstrations seen across the country in protest of public spending for the World Cup. âAs long as the demonstrations happen peacefully, I respect them. I do not want to see violence,â he said. âI do not like the vision that Europeans have about our country, that Brazil is bad. Brazil has many things to be great.â	sports

Chelsea youngster Tomas Kalas joins Koln on loan - Goal.com	The Czech defender made two Premier League appearances for the Blues in 2013-14 but will continue his development at the newly-promoted Bundesliga club Chelsea defender Tomas Kalas will join newly promoted FC Koln on a season-long loan on July 1. The Czech, who has a solitary international cap to his name, spent two seasons on loan at Dutch outfit Vitesse Arnhem before returning to Stamford Bridge for the 2013-14 campaign. After being handed his Chelsea debut as a late substitute in a 2-0 League Cup win at Arsenal in October, Kalas made his European bow in a last-16 home triumph over Galatasaray. Kalas' first start for the club came in the huge 2-0 Premier League victory at Liverpool in April, and he was among the starting XI once again on the last day of the Premier League season at relegated Cardiff City. The 21-year-old will now be hoping to pick up more first-team experience as Koln adjust to life back in the Bundesliga, after topping the second tier last term. Kalas arrived at Chelsea from Sigma Olomouc in 2011.	sports

Fifa behaves like mafia family, says Lord Triesman - Goal.com	The former English Football Association chairman has compared the organisation's beleaguered leadership to the Corleone crime family depicted in the Godfather films Fifa behaves like a "mafia family" with a tradition of "bribes, bungs and corruption", according to former English Football Association chairman Lord Triesman. World football's governing body has been rocked by a series of scandals in recent years, most recently allegations published by The Sunday Times newspaper relating to impropriety in Qatar's successful bid to host the 2022 World Cup. Fifa's bullish response to the allegations has led several high-ranking Uefa delegates to call for president Sepp Blatter to step down after 16 years at the head of the organisation. And Triesman, who was FA chairman when England launched its failed bid to host the 2018 World Cup, has launched a scathing public attack on the Fifa leadership, likening it to the Corleone crime family depicted in the Godfather films. "Fifa, Iâm afraid, behaves like a mafia family. It has a decades-long tradition of bribes, bungs and corruption," he said during a debate on the Queen's Speech in the House of Lords. "About half of its executive committee who voted on the last World Cup have had to go. "Even its past president Joao Havelange has been removed from his honorary life presidency in his 90s. "Systematic corruption underpinned by non-existent investigations where most of the accused are exempt from the investigation make it impossible to proceed. "Don Corleone, I believe, would have recognised the tactics and he probably would have admired them."	sports

Ghana face anxious wait on injured Abdul Majeed Waris - Goal.com	The striker suffered a torn thigh muscle in the friendly win over South Korea and is a doubt for the World Cup opener against USA on Monday Scans have revealed that Ghana striker Abdul Majeed Waris has a torn quadricep and faces a race against time to be fit for the World Cup. The injury was at first thought to be relatively minor, incurred during the fourth minute of Monday's 4-0 friendly victory over South Korea. "He had a knock on his left thigh," said team doctor Baba Adam. "We initially tried to see if he could go back to play but we realised it was an injury that needed to be taken care of and managed well. "We did an MRI on the quadriceps and what we realised is that, there was a tear. "We hope to get him on to the field again pretty soon. However, we are still monitoring him to the deadline when we will give our final statement on his state of affairs." Waris' absence would be a huge blow afterÂ the diminutive attacker played an integral part in Ghana's qualification for Brazil, during which he scored three goals. "The Fifa deadline is (June) 15, so we will monitor until that day and see how things turn up," said Adam before adding that Waris is improving and "can now bend his knee with little pain." Ghana begin their World Cup campaign against the United States on Monday before meeting Germany on June 21 and Portugal on June 26.	sports
Sepp Blatter: I want an interplanetary World Cup - Telegraph	Triesman, the initial chairman of England's doomed bid to host the 2018 World Cup, has previously claimed four Fifa members sought bribes in return for votes. In the light of recent media allegations of corruption in Qatar's successful bid for the 2022 World Cup, Triesman stepped up his attack on the governing body, claiming attempts by Blatter to dismiss the issue was a tactic that would have been approved by movie Godfather Don Corleone. "Fifa, I'm afraid, behaves like a mafia family. It has a decades-long tradition of bribes, bungs and corruption," he said. Speaking during a debate on the Queen's Speech in the House of Lords, Triesman applauded the stand taken by current FA chairman Greg Dyke against the "grotesque" accusation by Blatter that media investigations into corruption at Fifa were racist. He told peers: "Don Corleone, I believe, would have recognised the tactics and he probably would have admired them." Speaking on the eve of the World Cup in Brazil, Blatter also said Fifa must move forward in a changing world in which football had become a "multi-billion dollar" industry with "powerful opportunities". "Our world is changing, our game is changing. Our organisation must also change. It is our duty to keep football going forward. "It is our duty to lead by example and behave like an example, with integrity." Blatter said football's growth "creates powerful opportunities. Sometimes it creates controversial situations and then some difficulty".	sports
The Page That Worries It's In The Minority | Football365 | Mediawatch	Latest Articles Steve Bruce should be England manager because he was a good captain, England have let down Chile, Gary Lineker has done a massive about-turn and more... We made a bit of a boo-boo about Luis Suarez, Oliver Holt asks for a 'tweak' and then calls it a 'gamble' and Neil Ashton wants Hodgson out because he didn't pick James Milner... The Wrong Stuff Given its daily duty, Mediawatch grows adapted to reading the sort of pieces that may make less-accustomed readers fall off their chairs in surprise, anger, sadness or a merry mix of all three. However, the front page of this morning's The Sun contains a quote so entrenched in parody that even we failed to hide our shock. Strap yourselves in. 'The next young player who says he does not want to play for England should be ordered to ring the parents of a soldier who has died serving his country in Afghanistan and tell them his reasons,' is the quote in question from Ian Wright on the paper's FRONT page. Yes, really. A few questions, Ian: 1) Why on earth are you comparing playing football for your country with fighting and losing your life in a war? Football is a place in which priorities are skewed and importance inflated at the best of times, but even Wrighty must see that his equation is deeply flawed? Bill Shankly's memorable epithet regarding the game being "more than a matter of life and death" was intended as a pithy display of just how much football meant to him. It should not be used as a relevant moral compass. Football is not 'just a game', but that only refers to its growth as a commercial entity and potential vehicle for unity, rather than being equatable to the dangers of conflict. 2) What on earth would a player say to soldiers' families? "Hi, is that Mrs Moore?" "Good, I was just calling because I have been 'forced' to explain to you the reasons why I don't want to play in England's next friendly against Latvia" "Oh... Yes I suppose you're right, you probably have got better things to think about. It's just that a columnist in The Sun said..." "Yes, true. He probably was just trying to get a reaction. And you're right, the paper probably did put it on the front page just to sell copies, fully in the knowledge that it would generate a heated reaction. And yes, I guess that is actually quite demeaning to you and your loss. Sorry to have troubled you." 3) Why would these calls to families serve any purpose to either party? Wright's intention is to shame the apparent disrespect displayed by those not wanting to play for England, but in fact only demonstrates incredible insensitivity to the families of those killed in war. Mediawatch doesn't feel like it can or should speak on their behalf, but we're pretty sure that a fringe player choosing not to play for his country's football team fails to even flicker on the radar of those who have suffered such a tragic loss. Comparing those two scenarios only serves to demean such tragedy. Reading The Riot Act The Sun don't stop their campaign of cretinism there though. Oh no. 'Bookworm,' screams the headline on the back page of the paper. 'Dyke's 'Death in Brazil' Blunder,' reads the tagline. Oh goodness, has Football Association chairman Greg Dyke killed a man on Copacabana beach? No, he hasn't. Instead he has been 'caught' reading a book called 'Death in Brazil', a novel by Peter Robb that describes Brazil's multicultural history through the mediums of sex, food and death. It is, Mediawatch has been told, quite brilliant. This disgusting action on Dyke's part is labelled as a 'major blunder' and a 'PR disaster' by The Sun, who describe his decision to read Peter Robb's book as 'capping the end of a nightmare campaign for England.' Finally, the paper claim the incident is 'embarrassing'. Which of course it isn't. But using the back page spread of your paper to criticise a man for reading a book with a particular title is. It really, really is. Where's The Passion, Lads? Mediawatch completed its headache-inducing hat-trick in The Sun with Tony Parsons predictably calling for 'passion' in a piece that might as well be written in the blood of the dragon slayed by St. George. We know Parsons wants 'passion' because the word is in capital letters on the front page of the paper. It's also used in the byline to the piece. It's also capitalised and emboldened on three separate occasions in the piece itself. We've had quite enough of The Sun 's jingoistic bulls**t for one day, so will instead simply let you tick off your World Cup exit fall-out bingo card: 'Where was the fire in the belly?' - Check. 'Where was the blood of Terry Butcher' - Check. 'All guns blazing' - Check. 'Charge of the light brigade' - Check. 'Dunkirk' - Check. 'We could not fight our way out of a paper bag, let alone fight Nazi Germany. We would give Hitler a house and tell him to bring the family' - House. If this is what England wants, we don't want England. Someone pass Mediawatch its passport. Fix You 'Roy: We Need Six Years To Fix It,' farts out the claim on the back page of the Daily Mail. Connoisseurs will spot the lack of speech marks in the headline to a piece written by Neil Ashton. That's key here. Actual quotes from Roy Hodgson: "I'm now giving them the opportunity, not because I can, but because this is a good team and they can go and win the game. I hope they prove me right. "We just hope the next two, four to six years will bring some dividends from this. We are no longer capable of going through, but we're trying to build the confidence." Welcome to the Daily Mail's quote translator, where the England manager explaining the benefit of using young players against Costa Rica because it will give them experience for their future England careers becomes 'We Need Six Years To Fix It'. Why of course. Just Another 'Exclusive' 'EXCLUSIVE: Herrera WILL complete Â£28m move to United TODAY,' screams the headline on the Daily Mail website. Presumably, 'exclusive' is now short for 'well the Spanish media ran this last night but we've got it too so click here'? The Final Word Mediawatch greatly enjoyed Adrian Durham's list of '10 things the Three Lions boss MUST do ahead of Euro 2016' piece on the Daily Mail website, because there is nothing better than an experienced tactician and manager passing on his wisdom. The expert coach's big ideas include the following pieces of advice. See if you can spot the problem: 'Pick Daniel Sturridge and Rooney as a front pair' 'Flood the midfield by picking Michael Carrick, Jack Wilshere and Steven Gerrard' 'Right now I would suggest that Ross Barkley, Luke Shaw, John Stones and Raheem Sterling are good enough to start for England'. Yes, that's right. From now on England will be playing with Luke Shaw and John Stones as part of a three-man defence with no wing-backs. And you thought Roy Hodgson had been adventurous in Brazil. However, Mediawatch enjoyed no. 6 on Durham's list the most. 'Wilshere loves playing for England... so play him!' is Durham's logic. Yes, forget form, fitness or ability, it's who 'loves' it most that should get in the team. We presume Terry Butcher is the other choice for that three-man defence. 'Have I Just Read That?' Questions Of The Day 'How many fat East Europeans do you see? How many Chinese are on benefits? Where did it all go wrong' - Tony Parsons continues his charm offensive in The Sun. Optimistic Statement Of The Day 'There will be no angry mob, no mood to vilify them - just a general acceptance that we didn't expect much more anyway' - Dave Kidd in the Daily Mirror clearly hasn't read the tabloids over the last few days. For that he should be thankful. Headline Of The Day 'He's For Real' - Nice work from the Daily Mirror on Luis Suarez. Now we're all doing the Ali G voice in our head. Worst Headline Of The Day 'Loot Shaw' - He is going to cost an awful lot of money, but that doesn't excuse such weak punnery from the Daily Mirror. Non-Football Story Of The Day 'A man has had to be rescued by firefighters in Germany after becoming stuck inside a stone vagina.

'According to German newspaper SchwÃ¤bisches Tagblatt, five emergency service vehicles and 22 firemen had to help free the man.

Is Anybody Still Defending This Lethal Weapon? | F365 Says	Surely there comes a point when even his greatest Liverpool-supporting defenders put their hands up and admit he's a tool. But he's a tool that they'll probably keep now... Last Updated: 24/06/14 at 20:28 Post Comment Latest Articles Some will demand inquests but is there anything fundamentally wrong with England or are they just a half-decent side who came up narrowly short? The truth is pretty dull... Having been urged to 'give youth a chance' and 'change the shape' before Brazil, Roy Hodgson did exactly that. It's difficult to vilify a man that did what we would do, says Philip Cornwall... It might have been a miserable week on Football365 but battered spirits have been raised by commenters on Monday's otherwise-anodyne gossip column suggesting that a swap deal involving Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi might see Liverpool getting the sticky end of the exchange. Seriously. I'd consider a straight swap, Messi for Suarez would be an acceptable gamble (and it would be a gamble - Messi's relatively poor form this season could be the beginnings of a decline) but I'd rather keep Suarez. Hopefully Suarez meant it when he said he doesn't want to leave and will come out and say it again after the World Cup. That was our favourite comment but there have been others - from those who refuse to believe that Suarez might want to leave Liverpool, just as they refused to believe that he might want to leave Liverpool last summer, refused to believe that he would use racist language and refused to believe that two biting incidents were anything other than coincidence. Now there's a third. As we are struggling to name more than a handful of footballers who have felt the need to sink their teeth into an opposition player once, surely even the Uruguayan's staunchest suppporters have to admit that three times offers pretty compelling evidence that they have been defending the indefensible. We have been told that he has redeemed himself this season by a) scoring a lot of goals and b) not biting or racially abusing anyone, prompting wonderful jokes about Adolf Hitler 'redeeming himself' with that 30-goal season for Sturm Graz. Like the audience who give the guests on Jeremy Kyle a round of applause for finding the strength to stop using the family allowance to buy crack, a lot of gullible people have been fooled - or have chosen to be fooled because, after all, he scores a lot of goals - by a total weapon briefly behaving like a decent human being. There is good news for those deluded Liverpool fans who would turn down Messi for the walking liability that is Suarez: He is now unlikely to join Real Madrid or Barcelona, two clubs who put far too much weight on commercial value to sign a footballer who would turn the stomach of many fans and sponsors. They baulked at signing him last summer after he grazed on Branislav Ivanovic and it's likely that they will baulk at signing him again after he repeated his trick on football's biggest stage. If Suarez had been keeping his nose (and teeth) clean for a year to re-build his reputation and earn himself a move, he has stumbled at the very last hurdle, just 12 or 13 minutes away from the end of his season as Uruguay faced World Cup exit. Such a low level of self-control is extraordinary. There will be those that ignore the video evidence and claim Suarez has been tried on reputation alone, there will those who claim that whatever he does in a Uruguayan shirt is irrelevant and there will be those who find somebody else to blame (the media again, perhaps?) for his indiscretions. But maybe there should also be those who admit that Liverpool only own one of the top five footballers in the world because he is so very, very flawed. Sarah Winterburn	sports
Failure By Fine Margins Teaches Nothing.... | F365 Says	Some will demand inquests but is there anything fundamentally wrong with England or are they just a half-decent side who came up narrowly short? The truth is pretty dull... Last Updated: 24/06/14 at 23:35 Post Comment Latest Articles Surely there comes a point when even his greatest Liverpool-supporting defenders put their hands up and admit he's a tool. But he's a tool that they'll probably keep now... Having been urged to 'give youth a chance' and 'change the shape' before Brazil, Roy Hodgson did exactly that. It's difficult to vilify a man that did what we would do, says Philip Cornwall... If somebody had said two weeks ago that England would end the their Group D campaign having had the most shots (38), allowed the opposition the fewest attempts (25), dribbled past twice as many opposition players (41) as their rivals and had a pass completion rate of 85%, our only question would have been whether that was enough for first place or we would have to settle for a runners-up spot. England have, quite bizarrely, recorded the statistics of a team who have started this World Cup with the form of potential semi-finalists, rather than a team who have ended their sorry sojourn with just one point. Which shows you that a) statistics can sometimes be incredibly misleading and b) England really have failed by fine margins. England are not Spain, the world and European champions who saw their creaking system and players torn apart by Holland and then Chile; they are not Portugal, who have once again been exposed as a one-man band without a tune; they have simply been narrowly beaten twice by teams of very similar strength and then drawn a dead rubber 0-0 after fielding a much-changed side. It's the kind of 'not quite' run that even the greatest teams and the greatest managers will 'suffer' at least once a season. But this is international football and there is no looming run of games where the 'not quite' can quickly become the 'just about'. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with this English team in their tactics, their attitude, their desire; they simply lack a little bit of quality and, in this tournament, a little bit of luck. The difference between England finishing top or bottom of that group were a scuffed shot here, a poor refereeing decision there, a failure to track here, a header an inch too high there. I am no more depressed about this England side on the evening of June 24 as I was on the morning of June 14. It still has the same strengths (attacking players who can run at the opposition, the promise of youth, hard-working wide players) and weaknesses (an average defence, a lack of holding midfielders, no truly world-class player to make the difference in close encounters). It is a side good enough to beat most but rarely good enough to beat the best. It's incredibly lazy to talk about a lack of passion, it's incredibly crass to cite war metaphors, it's incredibly short-sighted to blame the manager, it's incredibly forgetful to blame a foreign influx and it's incredibly boring for the rest of us when club loyalties take over and individual players are cited. The rather dull truth is that England came up narrowly short. Play those games again with the same players and the results may have been different enough to see England through as champions. Play them a third time and we may not score a goal or claim a single point. There are still a handful of reasons to be cheerful and many reasons to be cheerless about England's future - you'll read plenty about the latter in the coming weeks because of what happened in ten pretty unsurprising days in Brazil, but the former will be forgotten for the same reason.

Transfer news: Dinamo Moscow agree deal for Manchester United full-back Alexander Buttner | Football365 | Premier League News	Dinamo Moscow have confirmed that a deal to sign full-back Alexander Buttner from Manchester United has been agreed. Last Updated: 24/06/14 at 15:36 Post Comment Alexander Buttner: Agrees deal to join Dinamo Moscow The 25-year-old only moved to Old Trafford from Dutch side Vitesse in 2012, but as understudy to Patrice Evra he was limited to just 13 Premier League games over the course of two seasons in England. With Evra having signed a new one-year deal and Southampton left-back Luke Shaw also on Unitedâs radar this summer, first-team opportunities for the new season appeared to be slim once again for Buttner. A three-year contract has been agreed to make the switch to the Russian capital and the deal will be finalised once technical details have been ironed out. Buttner told Dinamoâs official website: "I want to play in the Champions League and win trophies. "Dinamo have a very strong team and I believe we can fight for first place this season."	sports

Giving Rio Â£65,000 A Week. What Could Go Wrong? | Football365 | Opinion | Mailbox	Latest Articles Jack Rodwell can become the player England crave, according to one mailboxer. Others are enjoying Neymar and longing for Jose Mourinho as England boss... It does seem a tad ridiculous. But it will allow Liverpool to build half a team. We have lots of mails on England really not being bad, Henderson for captain and more... If you have anything to say on any subject, mail us at theeditor@football365.com We Got a Few Of These Terry Hall, Switzerland. Jack Rodwell England Captain in 2016? Are you on drugs? James, Ireland Not Wanting England To Win Without wanting to be accused of treason and marched to the front door of a grieving family by Ian Wright, I think a convincing victory for England today could be the worst thing that could happen, and that's not just for the headline 'Costa Eureka!' that will adorn the papers tomorrow. Of course, it makes sense to always have half an eye on the next major tournament, and the expansion to 24 teams in the European Championships means that England should really never fail to qualify for it ever again, but much like any game of football, you should be picking your best players to get the job done. Tonight is a meaningless game for England and I can understand the experimentation, but should they win 3-0, that does not mean this is England's best team. The cry for this massively inexperienced team to carry on into the qualifiers for Euro 2016 will be deafening and I only hope Roy Hodgson has the sense about him to realise that actually, the team he picked for the first two games is, more or less, his best team, even if it wasn't utilised in the best manner. There are question marks of course, and as with any tournament, you would expect a couple of players to be phased out. Wholesale change though is not needed. Wholesale change has already happened in many respects when you look at this squad compared to that of even two years ago. Half the squad has changed already - that's major surgery! Many people seem to be pinning their hopes on the likes of Luke Shaw, who is a very good player but is still very young, and John Stones, who has a handful of impressive games for Everton under his belt. These guys may turn out to be wonderful players, but if they don't break into the England team until they're 22/23, that isn't the end of the world. Seriously, when will we learn? Leighton Baines, despite being 29, is still a relative newcomer to the international scene and deserves a chance to bed in. The same is true of the likes of Lallana, Henderson, Wilshere and even Jagielka and Cahill. Because of the longevity of the previous generation, we have a raft of players in their mid to late twenties with very little international experience. Any good team has the right mix of youth and experience. To throw the likes of Gerrard, Rooney (and dare I say it, Ashley Cole) on the scrap heap too early would be cutting off our nose to spite our face. Italy with Pirlo and Mexico with Marquez have both put extra players in certain areas on their team to allow their older players to continue to flourish, which is something Hodgson has neglected to do. Isn't something along those lines worthy of experimentation as much as filling the team full of kids who have thus far shown no signs of surpassing the people they are being lined up to replace? I think, as a nation, we are sorely mistaken if we think we have players of the quality of Gerrard, Lampard and Rooney coming through our ranks. If it forces us to focus on the collective rather than the individual then it's for the better, but forgive me if I remain sceptical on that one. Andy, London England had The Group Of Death Ever since the WC draw, Group G with Germany/Portugal/USA/Ghana has been dubbed the "group of death". At the time, I couldn't argue. As of December 6, 2013, Ze Germans were ranked 2nd, Portugal 5th, USA 14th and Ghana 24th. 45 total? That's ridiculous! Come the start of the World Cup, however, Despite Germany still being 2nd, Portugal up to 4th and USA up to 13th, Ghana had dropped to 37th. That's a combined total of 56. Uruguay at 7th, Italy at 9th, England at 10th and Costa Rica at 28th gives us a total of 54, the lowest combined ranking of any group. We were 6/7/13/31 for 57 at the time of the draw. I still hold onto some hope that we can beat Costa Rica today and save some face after playing the REAL Group of Death at this year's WC. Dickon, Sandford Send Them All To School With a country of 60 million people, amongst the highest paid players in the world, a smorgasbord of talent, why do we always fail dismally at international competition. To answer this, you must find the unique characteristic of the English footballer. And this is found at the heart, no the arse of this septic isle. The chav. The ignoramus who lionized Jade Goody (God rest her soul), the country that invented binge drinking, the nation with the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in Europe, the 'fan' who whilst not inventing football hooliganism, gave it that English touch; the English footballer is royalty amongst them all. This squad is dumb and getting dumber. Ask yourself how many players speak a foreign language ('Professor' Lampard's latin doesn't count). Most squads are bi-lingual and more. Why has no player in the Premiership come out as Gay, why do none of the squad play abroad? Why does an intelligent guy like Graeme Le Saux get hounded for reading the Guardian? The questions just pile up and the answer is always the same. Because the English footballer is dumb. Effectively taken from school at a young age, he is afraid of what's outside his comfort zone where his job on the pitch is drilled into him until thought is no longer required. And he has every right to be afraid because once he's playing for a different team and the opposition mixes it up a bit, changes their formation, plays with intelligence to maximize their qualities and expose deficiencies in the opposition, England players are left flat footed, literally and metaphorically - witness Gerrards utter lack of awareness of the gap on the left midfield and Rooney continuing to play where he does at Man U. Mercy! Glen Hoddle alluded to it with his plea for 'flexibility'. Lineaker alluded to it with his reference to Gerrards lack of 'football nous'. Chris Waddle shouts it from the rooftops but there aint no debate because the football-media are (wait for it) ex-footballers or journos too damned scared to rock the boat through fear of losing their stipend. The English footballer is dumb. He is uneducated. He cannot therefore react dynamically to change. And it aint gonna change until society changes. I sound like a snob. So what. Have you ever wondered why the English Rugby team is good (the pundit and ex hooker fercrisskes Brian Moore is a qualified solicitor - how many....no don't bother), the English cricket team was until recently the best. They're thinking people. The English footballer is not and that Ladies and Gentlemen is why. Adrian O'Sullivan Having A Rio Carnival So the inevitable has finally happened. Rio is joining the triffic lads down at Loftus Road. According to the papers he has taken a pay cut to join us and is on about 1/3 of his previous salary....so about Â£65,000 a week. Im trying to stay positive, and say the only reason he will be more motivated than the overpaid tripe we bought last time (Bosingwa, im looking at you) is that 'Arry gave him in his chance therefore he wouldn't want to let him down. And then i realise we've given Â£65,000 a week to a 35 year old - our four centre backs are C.Hill, R Dunne, R Ferdinand, N Onuoha -and if you take Onuhoa out and put these three in a foot race, you'd have to clear your weekend diary to see the winner finish. But not to worry - he's triffic. Smuggler McSmugglerson Worried About Inflated Fees I'm sure you will have seen a lot of this in the comments section recently but I am finding it hard to get my head around some of the transfer fees being touted this summer. I'm a Manchester United season ticket holder and whilst I'm delighted that we are looking to rebuild (any also with Van Gaal's promise at the World Cup) I cannot but be a little worried. Â£34m for a left back with only two years Premier League experience and no CL football reeks of a huge risk, and whilst I believe Herrera is a good player is he worth one and a half Ruud Van Nistelrooys? I used to remember getting extremely excited when a player was costing more than Â£20m, but now it seems it has to be the norm for anyone half decent. I understand inflation and the fact that Chelski and the oil money next door have somewhat driven up the costs, but with FFP in place I am slightly bemused - is anyone else? Annoyingly, and I despise the man, the only player who seems to actually be worth the amounts being quoted in the press is that Uruguayan chap who tends to bite people. Jack, Battersea Three's A Crowd Following on from Hulmy's observation about Dani Alves sporting three different haircuts in three different games, I was wondering has any other team worn three different jerseys in three different group games before like Spain did in this World Cup? They wore all white against The Netherlands, all red against Chile and all black against Australia. Thoroughly interesting I'm sure you'll agree. Kieran Whooley (This esteemed MC is sad enough to point out that France in 1978 is your answer) Oh, You Guys Excellent Mediawatch today guys. Really, really good. Dominic Philpot	sports

News of Shotton's possible availability this summer has alerted a number of Premier League and Championship clubs. Shotton is a product of Stoke's academy system and has played 70 first-team games for the Potters. The 25-year-old's versatility in that he can play in defence and midfield makes him an attractive proposition for his suitors as they look to bolster their squad options.	sports

If Suarez had been keeping his nose (and teeth) clean for a year to re-build his reputation and earn himself a move, he has stumbled at the very last hurdle, just 12 or 13 minutes away from the end of his season as Uruguay faced World Cup exit. Such a low level of self-control is extraordinary. There will be those that ignore the video evidence and claim Suarez has been tried on reputation alone, there will those who claim that whatever he does in a Uruguayan shirt is irrelevant and there will be those who find somebody else to blame (the media again, perhaps?) for his indiscretions. But maybe there should also be those who admit that Liverpool only own one of the top five footballers in the world because he is so very, very flawed. Sarah Winterburn	sports

Failure By Fine Margins Teaches Nothing.... | F365 Says	Some will demand inquests but is there anything fundamentally wrong with England or are they just a half-decent side who came up narrowly short?

It's difficult to vilify a man that did what we would do, says Philip Cornwall... If somebody had said two weeks ago that England would end the their Group D campaign having had the most shots (38), allowed the opposition the fewest attempts (25), dribbled past twice as many opposition players (41) as their rivals and had a pass completion rate of 85%, our only question would have been whether that was enough for first place or we would have to settle for a runners-up spot. England have, quite bizarrely, recorded the statistics of a team who have started this World Cup with the form of potential semi-finalists, rather than a team who have ended their sorry sojourn with just one point. Which shows you that a) statistics can sometimes be incredibly misleading and b) England really have failed by fine margins. England are not Spain, the world and European champions who saw their creaking system and players torn apart by Holland and then Chile; they are not Portugal, who have once again been exposed as a one-man band without a tune; they have simply been narrowly beaten twice by teams of very similar strength and then drawn a dead rubber 0-0 after fielding a much-changed side. It's the kind of 'not quite' run that even the greatest teams and the greatest managers will 'suffer' at least once a season. But this is international football and there is no looming run of games where the 'not quite' can quickly become the 'just about'. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with this English team in their tactics, their attitude, their desire; they simply lack a little bit of quality and, in this tournament, a little bit of luck. The difference between England finishing top or bottom of that group were a scuffed shot here, a poor refereeing decision there, a failure to track here, a header an inch too high there. I am no more depressed about this England side on the evening of June 24 as I was on the morning of June 14. It still has the same strengths (attacking players who can run at the opposition, the promise of youth, hard-working wide players) and weaknesses (an average defence, a lack of holding midfielders, no truly world-class player to make the difference in close encounters). It is a side good enough to beat most but rarely good enough to beat the best. It's incredibly lazy to talk about a lack of passion, it's incredibly crass to cite war metaphors, it's incredibly short-sighted to blame the manager, it's incredibly forgetful to blame a foreign influx and it's incredibly boring for the rest of us when club loyalties take over and individual players are cited. The rather dull truth is that England came up narrowly short. Play those games again with the same players and the results may have been different enough to see England through as champions. Play them a third time and we may not score a goal or claim a single point. There are still a handful of reasons to be cheerful and many reasons to be cheerless about England's future - you'll read plenty about the latter in the coming weeks because of what happened in ten pretty unsurprising days in Brazil, but the former will be forgotten for the same reason.

Transfer news: Premier League and Championship clubs chasing Stoke's Ryan Shotton | Football365 | Premier League News	Sky Sports understands a number of Premier League and Championship clubs are tracking Stoke City's Ryan Shotton. Last Updated: 24/06/14 at 16:19 Post Comment Ryan Shotton: Attracting interest from several clubs Shotton spent the first half of last season on loan at Wigan and he did not feature for Stoke after returning to the Britannia Stadium in January. News of Shotton's possible availability this summer has alerted a number of Premier League and Championship clubs. Shotton is a product of Stoke's academy system and has played 70 first-team games for the Potters. The 25-year-old's versatility in that he can play in defence and midfield makes him an attractive proposition for his suitors as they look to bolster their squad options.	sports

Transfer news: Veteran defender Rio Ferdinand in talks over move to Queens Park Rangers | Football365 | Premier League News	Rio Ferdinand is in talks with newly-promoted Queens Park Rangers â but that no deal has been done yet. Last Updated: 24/06/14 at 14:26 Post Comment Rio Ferdinand: Sees himself as an active footballer Ferdinand is a free agent after being released by Manchester United at the end of last season after 12 years at Old Trafford. If Ferdinand chooses to move to Loftus Road it will be the second time he has worked under Harry Redknapp. Ferdinand's representative Jamie Moralee has confirmed to Sky Sports News that Ferdinand is in talks over a proposed move to Loftus Road but no deal has been done as yet. Redknapp was the manager who gave him his debut at West Ham in 1996, and Ferdinand was the worldâs most expensive defender when he left to join Leeds United in an Â£18million deal in 2000. Ferdinand moved to Old Trafford on a five-year contract in another record deal in July 2002 and went on to win six Premier League titles and the 2008 Champions League during his time with United. He played 81 times for England between 1997 and 2011 and was a member of three World Cup squads. Speaking before he headed to Brazil, where he is working as a World Cup pundit, Ferdinand said: "I see myself as going to Rio very much as an active footballer with playing time ahead of me. "It is feasible that in the coming weeks, perhaps even while I'm in South America, I'll make a decision about the next stage in my career. "I have options on the table from several clubs in England and overseas for next season and I'm intending to play on if the right situation arises." Rio's brother Anton played for QPR for two seasons, leaving Loftus Road following their relegation to the Championship in 2013.Â 	sports

Transfer news: Newcastle defender Mathieu Debuchy admits to missing Champions League | Football365 | Premier League News	Mathieu Debuchy plans to address his Newcastle United future after the World Cup as he admits to missing UEFA Champions League football. Last Updated: 25/06/14 at 08:52 Post Comment Mathieu Debuchy: Has caught the eye at Newcastle The France international graced European footballâs premier club competition during his days at Lille, having helped them to the Ligue 1 title in 2011. A move to England followed in January 2013, with Debuchy joining the growing ranks of French talent at St Jamesâ Park. The 28-year-old has been a consistent performer for an inconsistent Newcastle side and is currently chasing down global glory with his countrymen in Brazil. Speculation is mounting that he could be on the move once his efforts in South America come to a close, with Paris Saint-Germain among those said to be keen, and Debuchy has hinted that he may be willing to consider a switch. He said in the Evening Chronicle: âPersonally, itâs a great adventure. I have discovered English charm, which is very hard, Newcastle and their extraordinary fans. âItâs really incredible to play in that atmosphere. âHaving said that, I miss European football and the Champions League in particular. âFor the moment, Iâm concentrating on the World Cup. Weâll see about the rest afterwards.â For now, Debuchyâs focus is locked on keeping himself ahead of Manchester City new boy Bacary Sagna in France coach Didier Deschampsâ plans. Ahead of a meeting with Ecuador on Wednesday, which has France looking to make it three wins from three in Group E, he added: âI want to play against Ecuador, but it could be a good chance to get others involved. Itâs up to the coach to decide. âThe guys that havenât played so far want to play in this game, weâre all competitive. I donât count myself as a starter in this side, I take it one match at a time. âItâs great to play in this French team, as weâve taken a huge step forward. The thing I love is our attacking play, itâs great to be a part of it.â	sports

"There is certainly no financial pressure to sell," Coates told the Stoke Sentinel. "It's a question of the numbers and the balance of the squad. "There comes a point when a squad can become difficult to manage because of the numbers, so size is very important. "But ultimately, of course, it is always down to the manager who comes and who goes."	sports

Midfielder Yaya and Liverpool defender Kolo Toure are currently in Brazil with the Ivory Coast squad at the World Cup. And Yaya Toure told France Football that City prevented him from leaving the title celebrations in Dubai. He said: "City did not want to give me a few days. I went to celebrate in the wake of the league title in Abu Dhabi, while my brother was dying in his bed. "In retrospect, I regret not having insisted. For not making them respect me. However, my employers knew that I was suffering for a few months seeing my brother's health decline." Toure also said of Ibrahim: "He was my confidant, my best friend too." City have declined to comment on Toure's remarks but it is understood they were not approached about the possibility of him returning to the UK. The club has granted compassionate leave in the past â former boss Roberto Mancini missed a game following the death of his father.	sports

Transfer news: Manchester United closing on transfer of Athletic Bilbao star Ander Herrera | Football365 | Premier League News	Manchester United are in advanced talks with Athletic Bilbao over the transfer of Ander Herrera. Last Updated: 24/06/14 at 15:49 Post Comment Ander Herrera: On verge of move to Manchester United Sky sources understand United are prepared to match the Â£28million buyout clause in the midfielderâs contract. United are aiming to get the deal - which would see Herrera sign a four-year contract - done by the end of this month as the buyout clause raises to Â£32m after 1 July. Herrera was the lynchpin of Bilbao's midfield last season as they finished in an impressive fourth place in La Liga.Â  He scored five goals in the campaign, but despite being one of the most impressive performers in domestic football, he is yet to break in to the Spain team. David Moyes was reportedly targeting Herrera, 24, last summer, but failed to land the central midfielder. There were bizarre scenes in Spain when, on transfer deadline, three men claiming to be representing United tried to negotiate the deal at the Spanish Football Association headquarters. The negotiations broke down and it transpired that United knew nothing about the three men.Â  But Moyes' successor as Manchester United boss, Louis van Gaal, looks set to pull off the deal as he begins rebuilding the squad. Herrera was born in Bilbao but came through the ranks at Real Zaragoza before joining his hometown club in 2011 on a five-year contract.

Transfer news: Newcastle defender Mathieu Debuchy admits to missing Champions League | Football365 | Premier League News	Mathieu Debuchy plans to address his Newcastle United future after the World Cup as he admits to missing UEFA Champions League football. Last Updated: 25/06/14 at 08:52 Post Comment Mathieu Debuchy: Has caught the eye at Newcastle The France international graced European footballâs premier club competition during his days at Lille, having helped them to the Ligue 1 title in 2011. A move to England followed in January 2013, with Debuchy joining the growing ranks of French talent at St Jamesâ Park. The 28-year-old has been a consistent performer for an inconsistent Newcastle side and is currently chasing down global glory with his countrymen in Brazil. Speculation is mounting that he could be on the move once his efforts in South America come to a close, with Paris Saint-Germain among those said to be keen, and Debuchy has hinted that he may be willing to consider a switch. He said in the Evening Chronicle: âPersonally, itâs a great adventure. I have discovered English charm, which is very hard, Newcastle and their extraordinary fans. âItâs really incredible to play in that atmosphere. âHaving said that, I miss European football and the Champions League in particular. âFor the moment, Iâm concentrating on the World Cup. Weâll see about the rest afterwards.â For now, Debuchyâs focus is locked on keeping himself ahead of Manchester City new boy Bacary Sagna in France coach Didier Deschampsâ plans. Ahead of a meeting with Ecuador on Wednesday, which has France looking to make it three wins from three in Group E, he added: âI want to play against Ecuador, but it could be a good chance to get others involved. Itâs up to the coach to decide. âThe guys that havenât played so far want to play in this game, weâre all competitive. I donât count myself as a starter in this side, I take it one match at a time. âItâs great to play in this French team, as weâve taken a huge step forward. The thing I love is our attacking play, itâs great to be a part of it.â	sports
Transfer news: Stoke chairman Peter Coates confirms players will leave | Football365 | Premier League News	Stoke City chairman Peter Coates has admitted there will be departures from the club before the end of the transfer window. Last Updated: 24/06/14 at 12:01 Post Comment Peter Coates: Admits players will leave Stoke this summer The Potters have been busy in the transfer market this summer bringing in four new signings to bolster Mark Hughes' squad. A number of players have been linked with moves out of the Britannia Stadium, including experienced striker Peter Crouch, and Coates admits players will leave as they look to maintain the size of the squad. "There is certainly no financial pressure to sell," Coates told the Stoke Sentinel. "It's a question of the numbers and the balance of the squad. "There comes a point when a squad can become difficult to manage because of the numbers, so size is very important. "But ultimately, of course, it is always down to the manager who comes and who goes."	sports
Transfer news: Diego Costa's transfer from Atletico Madrid to Chelsea not done yet | Football365 | Premier League News	Diego Costaâs move to Chelsea is not yet a done deal and Thibaut Courtois will not be returning to Atletico Madrid, according to the Spanish clubâs president Enrique Cerezo. Last Updated: 24/06/14 at 11:45 Post Comment Diego Costa: Part of Spain's miserable defence of their World Cup crown Cerezo confirmed Chelsea have made contact but have not agreed to meet the buy-out clause for the Brazilian-born striker, who was part of a dismal World Cup showing from Spain. The forward has long been linked with a big-money move to join Jose Mourinho at Chelsea, but Cerezo maintains the deal is far from complete. "We don't know anything about Costa, all we know is that Chelsea have made contact but we haven't received any money or anything else yet," Cerezo said. "Until we receive the money from his buy-out clause, he remains an Atletico player." Costa, 26, spearheaded Atleticoâs attack in a memorable season in which they won La Liga and reached the Champions League final under Argentine manager Diego Simeone. Atletico have a history of losing their marquee players with Fernando Torres, Sergio Aguero and Radamel Falcao all having left the club in recent years. The Atletico president admitted it is very difficult to say no when the biggest teams in Europe come calling. "We've always tried to convince our players to stay, but the difference between our finances and that of other clubs is very large," he said. Cerezo also confirmed Belgian goalkeeping star Courtois, who has been on loan to Atletico for the past three seasons, is set to return to Chelsea. "Chelsea can count on Courtois, because he is their player," he said. That will set up an enviable dilemma for Mourinho as he will have to choose between Courtois and long-time first-choice goalkeeper Peter Cech. In addition to the likely departures of Costa and Courtois, Atletico have bid farewell to David Villa, who has signed for Melbourne City, and Tiago Mendes, who is out of contract. Brazilian defenders Filipe Luis and Joao Miranda have also been linked with moves away from the Vicente Calderon Stadium. Atletico have a ready-made replacement for Luis if he does depart after signing highly-rated left-back Guilherme Siqueira from Granada. Â  "That's the way football is," added Cerezo on the changes the La Liga champions will undergo this summer. "We will try and get new players to come in who can score more goals or save more goals than the ones that are leaving."	sports

However, Adams remains a realist and understands that situation could drastically change before the window closes. This summerâs FIFA World Cup in Brazil has provided a distraction from the usual hive of transfer activity, and Adams admits he would delighted to keep his full squad intact. âIf players leave, weâve got to be ready to fill their positions,â Adams told the Norwich Evening News. âI donât want players leaving, but of course Iâm realistic to accept that might be the case. âI spoke to all the players at the end of last season - obviously not as full-time manager then, just to see whether they wanted to leave or be part of getting us back. âAnd virtually to a man, they were committed and there was a hunger there. Players who wanted to go and put it right.â Canaries playmaker Robert Snodgrass would be a significant loss and speculation surrounding the Scotland internationalâs future heightened on Monday with Sky Sources reporting Europa League-bound Hull City and fellow Premier League clubs QPR, Sunderland and West Brom have registered interest.	sports

"We're just thinking about ourselves and the unity of the group." Argentina struggled to a win over their Iranian counterparts, who seemed content to play a defensive game, and Di Maria has reacted angrily to suggestions that his side played below-par on Saturday. He told reporters: "I don't know why you keep saying we weren't playing well. When a team has 11 players in penalty area it's impossible to get in there."	sports

"If the money that is being mentioned in the English media is that, then we will have to listen to them when we receive an official offer. "Of course we would want to sell our players to the team that gets closest to our value." Balanta is currently with the Colombia squad at the World Cup finals.	sports
Transfer news: Manchester United closing on transfer of Athletic Bilbao star Ander Herrera | Football365 | Premier League News	Manchester United are in advanced talks with Athletic Bilbao over the transfer of Ander Herrera. Last Updated: 24/06/14 at 15:49 Post Comment Ander Herrera: On verge of move to Manchester United Sky sources understand United are prepared to match the Â£28million buyout clause in the midfielderâs contract. United are aiming to get the deal - which would see Herrera sign a four-year contract - done by the end of this month as the buyout clause raises to Â£32m after 1 July. Herrera was the lynchpin of Bilbao's midfield last season as they finished in an impressive fourth place in La Liga.Â  He scored five goals in the campaign, but despite being one of the most impressive performers in domestic football, he is yet to break in to the Spain team. David Moyes was reportedly targeting Herrera, 24, last summer, but failed to land the central midfielder. There were bizarre scenes in Spain when, on transfer deadline, three men claiming to be representing United tried to negotiate the deal at the Spanish Football Association headquarters. The negotiations broke down and it transpired that United knew nothing about the three men.Â  But Moyes' successor as Manchester United boss, Louis van Gaal, looks set to pull off the deal as he begins rebuilding the squad. Herrera was born in Bilbao but came through the ranks at Real Zaragoza before joining his hometown club in 2011 on a five-year contract. Sky Sports News reporter James Cooper said: "It is very, very close. It is a question of when, not if. It is more likely to be on Wednesday but Manchester United are very close to making their first signing of the summer and the first signing under Louis van Gaal.

A number of other clubs have also been connected to Balotelli, including Milanâs Serie A rivals Napoli, and Berlusconi has opened the door to a possible departure. "Balotelli is a great player and a real Italian talent, but nobody is irreplaceable. Weâll see what happens," said Berlusconi, who is the daughter of club president Silvio Berlusconi and also joint-CEO. Kaka's future at Milan is also in doubt after Major League Soccer side Orlando City revealed they were in talks over a deal to sign the Brazilian, and Berlusconi admits he too could leave. She said: "Kaka made history with Milan and I know he needs to make this important decision with absolute calm. If he stays then weâll be happy, but weâll have to take it into account if he does want to go."

Highly-rated Hellas Verona forward Juan Manuel Iturbe is one player on their radar and Berlusconi hopes a deal can be agreed. "Adriano Galliani (chief executive)Â and my father are working on it. This is a very solid club, among the best in Europe in terms of income," she said at a press conference.	sports

Staying put O'Shea has played over 100 games in his three seasons with Sunderland and insists he is looking to continue turning out at the top level for a while longer. "I definitely want to play on beyond next season," he said. "I played around 50 games last season and I'm fit and well, and long may that continue. "I'm already looking forward to next season after what was a roller-coaster end to last year. "But as for my future, that will be down to Sunderland. "I've never forced the issue throughout my career and Iâm not about to start now. "Look, it was great getting to the League Cup final and that was definitely an ambition when I joined Sunderland, to get to a Cup final and obviously to win one.

Transfer news: French striker Bafetimbi Gomis flying to Swansea for talks | Football365 | Premier League News	Sky sources understand French striker Bafetimbi Gomis is flying to Swansea on Monday to hold talks over a potential move to the Liberty Stadium. Last Updated: 23/06/14 at 14:59 Post Comment Batefimbi Gomis: Set for Swansea talks The 28-year-old is expected to meet with Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins and the clubâs manager Garry Monk to thrash out terms over a free transfer. Gomis is one of the most sought after free agents in Europe, following the expiry of his contract with Ligue 1 side Lyon. The France international scored 22 goals in 49 appearances in all competitions for Lyon last season and had been linked with a move to Premier League sides Newcastle, Sunderland and West Ham. Gomis is not part of Didier Deschampsâ France World Cup squad but has made 12 appearances for Les Bleus, scoring three times. Swansea are thought to have bid for Gomis last summer, before they signed Wilfried Bony. The move for Gomis will inevitably put a question mark over Bonyâs future with the club. The 25-year-oldâs agent recently said Bony will remain with Swansea unless the opportunity arises for him to move to a top six side in England, Germany, France or Spain. Bony became Swanseaâs club-record signing when he made a Â£13million move from Vitesse Arnhem and is currently on international duty at the World Cup with Ivory Coast. Swansea also have Spanish forward Michu on their books, although the former Rayo Vallecano man has been linked with West Ham, Stoke and Napoli. Michu scored 22 goals in his first season with Swansea but only found the back of the net on six occasions last term.	sports

Jose Mourinho has already stated that Courtois was in his plans for next season and Wilmots has confirmed this, but also added to the intrigue surrounding current No.1 Petr Cech, suggesting he could be sold. The conversation between Houllier and Courtois was broadcast by RTBF, in which the Frenchman asked: "Does he [Courtois] go back to Chelsea?" "He goes back to Chelsea," Wilmots replied. "They will sell Cech, then?" enquired Houllier, "If possible, yes," said the Belgian coach. Courtois has already suggested he would be heading back to Chelsea, and if he does it remains to be seen how that will impact on Cech, who has played over 300 games for the west London giants after joining from Rennes in 2004.	sports

"If Alberto Moreno has to stay at the club he will stay but if a club pays the amount we think is big enough for him to leave, he will leave. But there is no pressure."	sports
I never dodged England duty, insists Scott Parker after Harry Redknapp claims | News	Scott Parker says he never wanted to sidestep England duty, following claims made by his former manager at Tottenham, Harry Redknapp. Last Updated: 25/06/14 at 07:35 Post Comment Scott Parker: England appearances the "pinnacle" of his career Redknapp claimed that "two or three" English players had asked him to withdraw them from international duty while he was in charge at White Hart Lane between 2008 and 2012. The now-QPR boss has refused to name names but Parker, who won 18 England caps between 2003 and 2012 and spent two years playing under Redknapp at Spurs - insisted that featuring for his country had been the "pinnacle" of his career. Asked if he had never not wanted to represent England, Parker told Sky Sports News: "No, never. "I probably speak for every boy and everyone out there: playing for your country, replicating the players in the World Cup is something you dream of. "I remember Italia '90, being 10 and playing outside in the garden, thinking I was Gazza (Paul Gascoigne) and my friends thinking the same. "I can only speak from a personal level - obviously you get some people in life who'll be different - but I think the majority of players who put on an England shirt are very proud. "I hear people say that other countries are more passionate and have more desire but whenever I've been involved in the England set-up, the players have been committed. "It's a boy's dream; I can't contemplate not wanting to play for England. It's something I will always remember, the pinnacle of my career."	sports

World Cup: Frank Lampard unsure over England future after Costa Rica draw | News	Frank Lampard remains unsure over his international future after Englandâs World Cup campaign limped to a conclusion with a 0-0 draw against Costa Rica. Last Updated: 24/06/14 at 20:39 Post Comment Frank Lampard: Veteran midfielder captained England in 0-0 draw with Costa Rica The veteran midfielder, who will end his long association with Chelsea this summer, captained the side but could not lead them to victory over Costa Rica, who progress to the last 16 as Group D winners with England at the bottom of the table. With Lampard now 36, it is likely to have been his final World Cup appearance, but he insists he is yet to decide when he will call time on his career with the Three Lions. When asked about his future, he told ITV: "I don't know. I really enjoyed being involved and I love playing for my country, that's obvious. I am 36 and still doing it. "I feel fresh. If I feel I can offer something I will do but at the moment it is too soon to say." Lampard agreed with Roy Hodgsonâs post-match assessment that England had been the better side and could have won the game comfortably had they taken the opportunities they created, while also paying tribute to the support of the travelling fans. He added: "It was a difficult game to approach. "I think we did everything we could do. We showed a bit of character, we prepared right for the last two days. Everyone knows how tough it's been. "It wasn't vintage but we had enough chances to win the game. I think we played some good stuff, bright stuff at times, and created enough chances to win. âWeâre England, we expect more, they expect more and we didnât deliver. England fans have been an absolute credit, itâs a shame we couldnât do enough to take them through and give them a longer trip.â	sports
Barcelona and Real Madrid attract backing to sign Luis Suarez amid renewed press reports | Football365 | Premier League News	Sky Bet have slashed the odds on Luis Suarez leaving Liverpool this summer with Barcelona and Real Madrid both backed to secure his services. Last Updated: 23/06/14 at 15:08 Post Comment Luis Suarez: Linked with Barcelona and Real Madrid yet again Press reports surrounding a release clause in the Uruguay star's contract seem to have sparked the surge in interest, with suggestions that the Spanish giants are ready to engage in a battle for his signature. On the back of a phenomenal campaign for the Reds, in which he netted 31 times to put them on the brink of winning the Premier League, Suarez sent England crashing out of the World Cup with a brace on Thursday night. The 27-year-old recently moved to allay fears of his departure, telling Uruguayan TV channel Canal 10: "Don't worry, nothing is going to happen to me. I'm very happy here and my family is happy here." He also signed a new long-term contract in December but that has done little to prevent renewed speculation on a move to Spain this summer. Sky Bet's Head of Football Trading Paul Wiggins said: "We've seen a sudden surge in bets on Suarez's next club, with Barcelona in particular attracting backing. "While we're assuming these bets are a result of the media speculation as opposed to any inside knowledge, the volume of interest has forced us to cut his price on leaving from 2/1 to 5/6, with both Barcelona and Real Madrid 9/4 to get a deal done."

Premier League: Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud wants to improve scoring record | Football365 | Premier League News	Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud is determined to improve his scoring record and revealed manager Arsene Wenger is offering him plenty of guidance. Last Updated: 23/06/14 at 10:47 Post Comment Olivier Giroud: Looking to improve his scoring record at Arsenal The Gunners striker is currently helping Franceâs World Cup bid in Brazil and claimed an historic goal for his country during Fridayâs 5-2 triumph over Switzerland. After being used as a second-half substitute in a 3-0 win over Honduras, Giroud was brought into the starting line-up and got Les Bleus off to a flying start with a 17th-minute header which took France to 100 World Cup goals. On the domestic front, Giroud netted 16 goals and chalked up eight assists as Arsenal finished fourth in the Premier League but the 27-year-old is well aware of the need for a better return. âI feel I can go on improving,â he told LâEquipe. âI can improve some parts of my game and have better statistics. âFor a forward, statistics are important, especially when you negotiate a contract. In the Champions League, it was more difficult. But you also need titles and key performances. âI am working hard in front of goal post to try to sort out some details. I think about missed opportunities, notably against Chelsea.â Former Montpellier forward Giroud, who made the switch to Emirates Stadium in 2012, is keen to review his performances and admits Arsenal boss Wenger is looking for him to develop into a more intelligent player. âI have to be more decisive in the box, but also in my way to keep the ball and defend,â he added. âYou have to be demanding, trying to find peace in front of goal. âAt least once a week I try to work in front of goal. I have been doing it systematically since I have been at Arsenal. I need it. âArsene Wenger often gives me corrections after matches. We are talking about opportunities. âTo him, I am not crafty enough. Once he told me I am too frank in my runs, too predictable. I have to be more confusing.â	sports
Transfer News: Hull agree fee for Jake Livermore with Tottenham | Football365 | Premier League News	Hull have agreed an undisclosed fee with Tottenham for the permanent transfer of midfielder Jake Livermore. Last Updated: 21/06/14 at 18:08 Post Comment Hull City: Agree fee with Tottenham for Jake Livermore The 24-year-old is currently discussing personal terms with Steve Bruceâs side and Hull hope to conclude the deal early next week. Livermore spent last season on loan with Hull where he made 41 appearances, scoring six goals. A message on the club's official Twitter feed read: "Hull City can confirm that an undisclosed fee has been agreed with @SpursOfficial for the permanent transfer of Jake Livermore. "Personal terms are being discussed and we hope to conclude the deal early next week." The Enfield-born youngster is a product of Tottenhamâs academy and had loan spells with Derby County, Ipswich and Leeds early in his career. He made his first-team debut for Tottenham in the 2-1 Premier League win at Stoke in 2010 and went on to make 58 first-team appearances for the club.	sports
World Cup: England campaign ends with 0-0 draw against Group D winners Costa Rica | Football365 | Football Match Reports	Daniel Sturridge: Challenged by Oscar Duarte Roy Hodgson made nine changes to his starting line-up from the defeat against Uruguay, with the new-look side showing promise but suffering from many of the same failings which proved so costly in the 2-1 defeats by Italy and Uruguay. Daniel Sturridge, who had a strong first-half appeal for a penalty waved away, missed an excellent second-half chance to break the deadlock and there were several other promising opportunities which England could not take advantage of, while the defence looked occasionally shaky, with Chris Smalling particularly nervous. Ben Foster did well as Joe Hartâs replacement, tipping one first-half free-kick from Celso Borges onto the top of the crossbar, but he was less employed than opposite number Keylor Navas in Belo Horizonte, the scene of Englandâs infamous 1950 defeat to the USA. England's fans started off by cheering their team loudly, and the likes of Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana and the impressive Jack Wilshere responded with good performances. But by the end there was a flat feeling among the few thousand who had come to Estadio Mineirao and England head home having amassed just one point from their three matches - their worst points total in World Cup history. For the first minute and a half, Costa Rica's noisy fans shouted "Ole" as England chased shadows in the lunchtime heat. Within four minutes England were nearly behind. Randall Brenes found Joel Campbell on the edge of the box and his deflected looped up off Gary Cahill past Foster's goal. A few groans were heard as Smalling sliced a simple pass out of play. Cahill needlessly punted the ball out moments later. Finally, England came into the game courtesy of Wilshere, who beat two players and found Sturridge, but he dragged his shot just wide. Shaw, the youngest England player to start a World Cup game since Michael Owen, showed no sign of nerves going forward, but he gave away a free-kick in a dangerous position. Borges stepped up and bent a dipping shot over the wall and onto the bar via the fingertips of the athletic Foster. The only other point of note in the dull first period came just before the half hour when a Ross Barkley touched James Milner's cross into the path of Sturridge. The Liverpool striker shaped to shoot, but Duarte brought him down with an out-stretched leg. Referee Djamel Haimoudi waved play on, much to Sturridge's dismay. Fortune favoured England in a move straight after the break. Shaw's shot looped straight into the path of Sturridge in the box, but the striker mis-controlled, allowing Costa Rica goalkeeper Navas to smother the ball. Giancarlo Gonzalez dumped Barkley on the turf with a wrestling move, but Frank Lampard, appearing possibly for the last time in an England shirt, wasted the free-kick, driving straight into the wall. Phil Jones, a few minutes after failing to control a simple pass, then gave possession away inside his own half, but luckily for England Christian Bolanos shot straight at Foster. Wishere played a lovely one-two with Sturridge to set the striker free inside the box, but he curled an inch wide. Hodgson tried to inject some life into his team by introducing Raheem Sterling. The England support then demanded Wayne Rooney enter the pitch. Instead they got Steven Gerrard, who was cheered by the fans, who suspected this might be the captain's final England appearance. Rooney finally came on with 15 minutes left. The Manchester United striker attempted an audacious chip over Navas within minutes of his introduction. He also came within inches of turning home Lampard's cross in the dying minutes. England kept on trying, but they could not beat Costa Rica - a team ranked below Scotland by FIFA.	sports

Not Too Late For Rodwell To Lead England | Football365 | Opinion | Mailbox	Latest Articles An interesting Mailbox with thoughts on player intelligence, Rio Ferdinand's last hurrah with 'Arry, inflated transfer fees and wanting England to lose against Costa Rica... It does seem a tad ridiculous. But it will allow Liverpool to build half a team. We have lots of mails on England really not being bad, Henderson for captain and more... If you have anything to say on any subject, mail us at theeditor@football365.com Get Jack Back It has been often said during this tournament that England have lacked a truly defensive midfielder/screening midfielder/ whatever the current preferred term might be. The tragedy is that back in 2011, England had exactly what we needed - a young, tenacious, exciting, strong, physical, defensively capable midfielder, who was also able to break forward and find a through ball when necessary. Unfortunately (for him and for England), rather than make his name in his preferred position at the club where he grew into his trade, he moved to a bigger club (for admittedly understandable reasons, both financial and professional). I am of course talking about Jack Rodwell moving from Everton to Man City. We'll never know whether Rodwell would have become the player he was tipped to become had he got regular match time for the last 3 seasons - but what we do know is that other players who became "lost" in a large squad at a big club, have gone on to revive their careers when given a more prominent role (for example, Daniel Sturridge). I guess this leads me to two conclusions - firstly, for England to have the best chance in 2016, we need players like Shaw, Lallana, Barkley, Wilshere, Stones and even Jones and Smalling (heaven help us all) to play regularly in their best positions. Jones and Smalling in particular are excellent examples of players touted for a bright future at Blackburn and Fulham, hoovered up by a bigger club, then marginalised and held out of their best positions (by Vidic and Ferdinand, admittedly). This has clearly led to a regression in their performances that cannot simply be explained away by the argument of "the larger the club, the more focus on the player". This leads me to my second conclusion, that all hope is not lost for such players if they are given the chance to play regularly. If Rodwell does (as expected) leave Citeh on loan (or permanently) during this summer, there is still the opportunity for him to become the player that we all hoped he could be three seasons ago. Rodwell is still only 23 - coincidentally, the same age as Sturridge when he signed for Liverpool - and has plenty of time to mature into the combative midfielder (and captain?) that England will sorely need in 2016. Equally, the departure of Vidic and Ferdinand may give Jones and Smalling the opportunity to grow into the central defensive partnership that United (and England) are crying out for (unless Van Gaal buys Ron Vlaar.) Perhaps it's the fact that I support a "small" club, but I sincerely hope that if England's current crop of promising youngsters that are linked with a high profile transfer do make the jump to United (Shaw) / Liverpool (Barkley, Lallana) / Chelsea (Stones), that they are given the competitive game time to continue their development - not just for their own benefit, but for that of the national side as well. Terry Hall, Switzerland England Would Be Special Why can't the FA just give Jose Mourinho a shed load of cash, and promise him a knighthood when he wins us the World Cup. Hodgson might be a lovely chap and have all the best intentions, but his football teams have never won anything. All the youth development in the world doesn't make a difference when the manager has no tactical awareness. England look completely devoid of ideas when playing and seem to have had little coaching in how to attack in the final third. To compound it, England set up to allow the opposition to settle into position before every attack commences. It made me sick recently when I read we nearly got Jose for England manager and we ended up with Capello. Imagine England at this tournament with Jose leading it - England certainly wouldn't be out yet. Everybody hates Jose, apart from Chelsea fans I imagine. If he was managing England and getting us to the World Cup final he would be a national hero. Jim (for the record, not a Chelsea fan), Canterbury Shape Of Things To Come This might have already been said - if not, it should have - but England are not going to get any better in the next two years unless things change. We're out of another competition and it's the same old story. In two years time, the situation will be exactly the same; we'll qualify relatively easily (one or two dodgy away matches aside) and go into the Euros in decent form. Some of our players will have had good domestic seasons and there will be a quiet optimism that we can perform well. Sound familiar? That's pretty much the story for almost every tournament since Euro 96. We always kid ourselves into believing that we're on the cusp of another "golden generation", as if to say: "Don't worry about this tournament lads, it's the next one that counts. You'll be better for this experience." But we won't, at least not until things change. We need to stop relying on the supposed quality of our players and start putting more emphasis on effective tactics and systems. Look at the Dutch team; how many of those players would you say are superstars? Robben and van Persie are really the only ones that fit the bill. Of the rest, you've got Leroy Fer (relegated last season), Krul, De Guzman, Vorm and Vlaar (finished 10th, 12th & 15th with Newcastle, Swansea & Villa respectively). Plus four from Feyenoord, who got knocked out in the playoffs of the Europa League. Yet see how well they play. They have got their game plan spot on - even without van Persie in the line-up they weren't affected; if anything they defended better. The same goes for teams like Chile, USA, Mexico, Ghana, Costa Rica, Columbia etc. (success being relative, of course). It doesn't matter how good we think Luke Shaw, Raheem Sterling, Phil Jones, Ross Barkley et al are going to be; if we don't get the system right, it's moot. You can have the best players in world football in your team but if you don't use them in the right way you're still going to struggle. Case in point, Portugal; they have the Ballon D'Or winner in their team, and they've only got one point, having scored just twice. It's time to start actually planning how to deal with the opposition - learning to exploit their weaknesses and defend against their strengths. Enough of just chucking whichever flavours of the week aren't injured into some random formation and hoping for the best. If it means dropping players like Rooney or Gerrard, or bringing in players from less "fashionable" teams then so be it. I'm not saying we have no chance in the Euros but unless lessons are learned from both other countries, and from this tournament in general, then it's all just a little bit of history repeating. Ted, Manchester Foster And Bentley Deserve Credit Usually I'm with Nick Miller when he writes columns but on this occasion I think he is so desperate to play devil's advocate to the accepted norm that he has confused his own argument. I agree that if a player doesn't feel pride in representing his country then he shouldn't force/fake it but equally he should make it clear that he does not want to be considered for selection rather than taking up a position that a player who wants to play could take. I have much more respect for a Ben Foster, even as with many fans I'll never understand why you wouldn't want to play, being honest about it and requesting he isn't selected than a player who accepts the call-up then doesn't bother or pulls out at every available opportunity. The Foster issue is also hugely different to David Bentley's situation. While few football fans could understand why a footballer would ever give up that life/career to many it is probably just a job that pays the bills and many of us hate our jobs, perhaps do a half-arsed job but go into work every day and pick up the pay cheque regardless. So I don't blame Bentley for that even if it would piss me off to see him continue to pick up a wage at my club and provide nothing in return. If he chooses not to even do that then he deserves some credit. To confuse either of these issues with Capello missing his son's wedding or a player wanting to miss an international because his partner is expecting is nonsense and Redknapp knew this when he stuck his oar in and Nick should see this as well and call it for the petty, pathetic score settling that it is. He wasn't appealing for paternity leave for footballers, he was kicking Hodgson and the FA when they were down. These are legitimate reasons for missing a game/work and should be treated as such so if any attitude needs to change it is for these reasons not dead grannies or fake injuries or lack of pride. Also what is with this 'Suarez has had one good season' nonsense that seems to be sneaking into the mailbox as if it is fact? The guy scored 23 goals two years ago to go with his 31 this year despite missing 10 games, that's 54 goals in 66 games. He has a one in two record at international level and was top scorer in the qualifying campaign having been named player of the tournament at the last Copa America and having an excellent 2010 World Cup. All that without including his phenomenal record at Ajax (as we all know goals in countries other than Spain, Germany, Italy, France and especially England do not count). The guy has been superb for at least the past four years and has been getting better and better year on year and the figures being rumoured are therefore absolutely fair. Regards, Lindsay, Melbourne. Neymar: He's Quite Good How good was Neymar last night?! Yes he scored two good goals, but the most impressive things I saw from him were: - Tireless running to chase down loose balls and pressurise defenders. He is clearly not a lazy flair player. - Tricks and flicks being attempted. Some came off - there was a brilliant little flick off the outside of his right foot as he pirouetted to the left at the end of the first half which almost set up an awesome goal. But it's the fact that he kept trying them that made me most impressed; no England players would have attempted a rainbow kick from just outside the box. - No f***ying about! He got a bit of a kicking, but was generally straight back up again. Didn't go to ground as easily as most players have been doing at this WC. I know it was 'only' Cameroon, but I thought he was ace. Ian (Aberdeen kick off their Europa League season next week, jeez!) Towns, MUFC Slow And Steady Wins The Race In response to Andy, London, who wrote in to highlight how the World Cup is usually won by a slow starter - I couldn't agree more. I have been evangelising this truth for the past weeks to a somewhat uninterested & stubborn audience. Most of my mates watched the first round of games and immediately concluded that the semi-finalists would be Holland, Brazil, Germany, Argentina. I too wondered if they have never watched a World Cup before. It's a hard concept to explain but it just almost always turns out that way. The thing with a tournament like the World Cup is that, firstly, it is just that - a tournament, and not a league. Five goals in your first game doesn't give you any advantage over a team that draws their first two games and scraps through by an own-goal in the third group game. Also, it is very difficult to keep up the type of pace Holland (for example) started with for seven games - heck its hard in any part of the world to go seven games unbeaten. You can lose one game in the first three and still survive, but losing one game in the last four is the end of the road. Hence, a team can't afford to have a bad game in the second two weeks, but can afford to have a bad game in the first two weeks, learn your mistakes and power on from there. Your opposition gets tougher as the tournament progresses too and someone will have studied your technique by the time you get to the QF/SF stage. The chances of injuries and suspensions increase and the loss of a key defender to suspension/injury just means one mistake from a newcomer playing their first game of the tournament means the end of a World Cup for you. There is no goal difference factor later. There are just so many variables involved - nine points from the first three games means very little. That said, it's been a belter of a World Cup.

If you have anything to say on any subject, mail us at theeditor@football365.com We Got a Few Of These Terry Hall, Switzerland. Jack Rodwell England Captain in 2016? Are you on drugs? James, Ireland Not Wanting England To Win Without wanting to be accused of treason and marched to the front door of a grieving family by Ian Wright, I think a convincing victory for England today could be the worst thing that could happen, and that's not just for the headline 'Costa Eureka!' that will adorn the papers tomorrow. Of course, it makes sense to always have half an eye on the next major tournament, and the expansion to 24 teams in the European Championships means that England should really never fail to qualify for it ever again, but much like any game of football, you should be picking your best players to get the job done. Tonight is a meaningless game for England and I can understand the experimentation, but should they win 3-0, that does not mean this is England's best team. The cry for this massively inexperienced team to carry on into the qualifiers for Euro 2016 will be deafening and I only hope Roy Hodgson has the sense about him to realise that actually, the team he picked for the first two games is, more or less, his best team, even if it wasn't utilised in the best manner. There are question marks of course, and as with any tournament, you would expect a couple of players to be phased out. Wholesale change though is not needed. Wholesale change has already happened in many respects when you look at this squad compared to that of even two years ago. Half the squad has changed already - that's major surgery! Many people seem to be pinning their hopes on the likes of Luke Shaw, who is a very good player but is still very young, and John Stones, who has a handful of impressive games for Everton under his belt. These guys may turn out to be wonderful players, but if they don't break into the England team until they're 22/23, that isn't the end of the world. Seriously, when will we learn? Leighton Baines, despite being 29, is still a relative newcomer to the international scene and deserves a chance to bed in. The same is true of the likes of Lallana, Henderson, Wilshere and even Jagielka and Cahill. Because of the longevity of the previous generation, we have a raft of players in their mid to late twenties with very little international experience. Any good team has the right mix of youth and experience. To throw the likes of Gerrard, Rooney (and dare I say it, Ashley Cole) on the scrap heap too early would be cutting off our nose to spite our face. Italy with Pirlo and Mexico with Marquez have both put extra players in certain areas on their team to allow their older players to continue to flourish, which is something Hodgson has neglected to do. Isn't something along those lines worthy of experimentation as much as filling the team full of kids who have thus far shown no signs of surpassing the people they are being lined up to replace? I think, as a nation, we are sorely mistaken if we think we have players of the quality of Gerrard, Lampard and Rooney coming through our ranks. If it forces us to focus on the collective rather than the individual then it's for the better, but forgive me if I remain sceptical on that one. Andy, London England had The Group Of Death Ever since the WC draw, Group G with Germany/Portugal/USA/Ghana has been dubbed the "group of death". At the time, I couldn't argue. As of December 6, 2013, Ze Germans were ranked 2nd, Portugal 5th, USA 14th and Ghana 24th. 45 total? That's ridiculous! Come the start of the World Cup, however, Despite Germany still being 2nd, Portugal up to 4th and USA up to 13th, Ghana had dropped to 37th. That's a combined total of 56. Uruguay at 7th, Italy at 9th, England at 10th and Costa Rica at 28th gives us a total of 54, the lowest combined ranking of any group. We were 6/7/13/31 for 57 at the time of the draw. I still hold onto some hope that we can beat Costa Rica today and save some face after playing the REAL Group of Death at this year's WC. Dickon, Sandford Send Them All To School With a country of 60 million people, amongst the highest paid players in the world, a smorgasbord of talent, why do we always fail dismally at international competition. To answer this, you must find the unique characteristic of the English footballer. And this is found at the heart, no the arse of this septic isle. The chav. The ignoramus who lionized Jade Goody (God rest her soul), the country that invented binge drinking, the nation with the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in Europe, the 'fan' who whilst not inventing football hooliganism, gave it that English touch; the English footballer is royalty amongst them all. This squad is dumb and getting dumber. Ask yourself how many players speak a foreign language ('Professor' Lampard's latin doesn't count). Most squads are bi-lingual and more. Why has no player in the Premiership come out as Gay, why do none of the squad play abroad? Why does an intelligent guy like Graeme Le Saux get hounded for reading the Guardian? The questions just pile up and the answer is always the same. Because the English footballer is dumb. Effectively taken from school at a young age, he is afraid of what's outside his comfort zone where his job on the pitch is drilled into him until thought is no longer required. And he has every right to be afraid because once he's playing for a different team and the opposition mixes it up a bit, changes their formation, plays with intelligence to maximize their qualities and expose deficiencies in the opposition, England players are left flat footed, literally and metaphorically - witness Gerrards utter lack of awareness of the gap on the left midfield and Rooney continuing to play where he does at Man U. Mercy! Glen Hoddle alluded to it with his plea for 'flexibility'. Lineaker alluded to it with his reference to Gerrards lack of 'football nous'. Chris Waddle shouts it from the rooftops but there aint no debate because the football-media are (wait for it) ex-footballers or journos too damned scared to rock the boat through fear of losing their stipend. The English footballer is dumb. He is uneducated. He cannot therefore react dynamically to change. And it aint gonna change until society changes. I sound like a snob. So what. Have you ever wondered why the English Rugby team is good (the pundit and ex hooker fercrisskes Brian Moore is a qualified solicitor - how many....no don't bother), the English cricket team was until recently the best. They're thinking people. The English footballer is not and that Ladies and Gentlemen is why. Adrian O'Sullivan Having A Rio Carnival So the inevitable has finally happened. Rio is joining the triffic lads down at Loftus Road. According to the papers he has taken a pay cut to join us and is on about 1/3 of his previous salary....so about Â£65,000 a week. Im trying to stay positive, and say the only reason he will be more motivated than the overpaid tripe we bought last time (Bosingwa, im looking at you) is that 'Arry gave him in his chance therefore he wouldn't want to let him down. And then i realise we've given Â£65,000 a week to a 35 year old - our four centre backs are C.Hill, R Dunne, R Ferdinand, N Onuoha -and if you take Onuhoa out and put these three in a foot race, you'd have to clear your weekend diary to see the winner finish. But not to worry - he's triffic. Smuggler McSmugglerson Worried About Inflated Fees I'm sure you will have seen a lot of this in the comments section recently but I am finding it hard to get my head around some of the transfer fees being touted this summer. I'm a Manchester United season ticket holder and whilst I'm delighted that we are looking to rebuild (any also with Van Gaal's promise at the World Cup) I cannot but be a little worried. Â£34m for a left back with only two years Premier League experience and no CL football reeks of a huge risk, and whilst I believe Herrera is a good player is he worth one and a half Ruud Van Nistelrooys? I used to remember getting extremely excited when a player was costing more than Â£20m, but now it seems it has to be the norm for anyone half decent. I understand inflation and the fact that Chelski and the oil money next door have somewhat driven up the costs, but with FFP in place I am slightly bemused - is anyone else? Annoyingly, and I despise the man, the only player who seems to actually be worth the amounts being quoted in the press is that Uruguayan chap who tends to bite people. Jack, Battersea Three's A Crowd Following on from Hulmy's observation about Dani Alves sporting three different haircuts in three different games, I was wondering has any other team worn three different jerseys in three different group games before like Spain did in this World Cup?

Giving Rio Â£65,000 A Week. What Could Go Wrong? | Football365 | Opinion | Mailbox	Latest Articles Jack Rodwell can become the player England crave, according to one mailboxer. Others are enjoying Neymar and longing for Jose Mourinho as England boss... It does seem a tad ridiculous. But it will allow Liverpool to build half a team. We have lots of mails on England really not being bad, Henderson for captain and more... If you have anything to say on any subject, mail us at theeditor@football365.com We Got a Few Of These Terry Hall, Switzerland. Jack Rodwell England Captain in 2016? Are you on drugs? James, Ireland Not Wanting England To Win Without wanting to be accused of treason and marched to the front door of a grieving family by Ian Wright, I think a convincing victory for England today could be the worst thing that could happen, and that's not just for the headline 'Costa Eureka!' that will adorn the papers tomorrow. Of course, it makes sense to always have half an eye on the next major tournament, and the expansion to 24 teams in the European Championships means that England should really never fail to qualify for it ever again, but much like any game of football, you should be picking your best players to get the job done. Tonight is a meaningless game for England and I can understand the experimentation, but should they win 3-0, that does not mean this is England's best team. The cry for this massively inexperienced team to carry on into the qualifiers for Euro 2016 will be deafening and I only hope Roy Hodgson has the sense about him to realise that actually, the team he picked for the first two games is, more or less, his best team, even if it wasn't utilised in the best manner. There are question marks of course, and as with any tournament, you would expect a couple of players to be phased out. Wholesale change though is not needed. Wholesale change has already happened in many respects when you look at this squad compared to that of even two years ago. Half the squad has changed already - that's major surgery! Many people seem to be pinning their hopes on the likes of Luke Shaw, who is a very good player but is still very young, and John Stones, who has a handful of impressive games for Everton under his belt. These guys may turn out to be wonderful players, but if they don't break into the England team until they're 22/23, that isn't the end of the world. Seriously, when will we learn? Leighton Baines, despite being 29, is still a relative newcomer to the international scene and deserves a chance to bed in. The same is true of the likes of Lallana, Henderson, Wilshere and even Jagielka and Cahill. Because of the longevity of the previous generation, we have a raft of players in their mid to late twenties with very little international experience. Any good team has the right mix of youth and experience. To throw the likes of Gerrard, Rooney (and dare I say it, Ashley Cole) on the scrap heap too early would be cutting off our nose to spite our face.

Not Too Late For Rodwell To Lead England | Football365 | Opinion | Mailbox	Latest Articles An interesting Mailbox with thoughts on player intelligence, Rio Ferdinand's last hurrah with 'Arry, inflated transfer fees and wanting England to lose against Costa Rica... It does seem a tad ridiculous. But it will allow Liverpool to build half a team. We have lots of mails on England really not being bad, Henderson for captain and more... If you have anything to say on any subject, mail us at theeditor@football365.com Get Jack Back It has been often said during this tournament that England have lacked a truly defensive midfielder/screening midfielder/ whatever the current preferred term might be. The tragedy is that back in 2011, England had exactly what we needed - a young, tenacious, exciting, strong, physical, defensively capable midfielder, who was also able to break forward and find a through ball when necessary. Unfortunately (for him and for England), rather than make his name in his preferred position at the club where he grew into his trade, he moved to a bigger club (for admittedly understandable reasons, both financial and professional). I am of course talking about Jack Rodwell moving from Everton to Man City. We'll never know whether Rodwell would have become the player he was tipped to become had he got regular match time for the last 3 seasons - but what we do know is that other players who became "lost" in a large squad at a big club, have gone on to revive their careers when given a more prominent role (for example, Daniel Sturridge). I guess this leads me to two conclusions - firstly, for England to have the best chance in 2016, we need players like Shaw, Lallana, Barkley, Wilshere, Stones and even Jones and Smalling (heaven help us all) to play regularly in their best positions. Jones and Smalling in particular are excellent examples of players touted for a bright future at Blackburn and Fulham, hoovered up by a bigger club, then marginalised and held out of their best positions (by Vidic and Ferdinand, admittedly). This has clearly led to a regression in their performances that cannot simply be explained away by the argument of "the larger the club, the more focus on the player". This leads me to my second conclusion, that all hope is not lost for such players if they are given the chance to play regularly. If Rodwell does (as expected) leave Citeh on loan (or permanently) during this summer, there is still the opportunity for him to become the player that we all hoped he could be three seasons ago. Rodwell is still only 23 - coincidentally, the same age as Sturridge when he signed for Liverpool - and has plenty of time to mature into the combative midfielder (and captain?) that England will sorely need in 2016. Equally, the departure of Vidic and Ferdinand may give Jones and Smalling the opportunity to grow into the central defensive partnership that United (and England) are crying out for (unless Van Gaal buys Ron Vlaar.) Perhaps it's the fact that I support a "small" club, but I sincerely hope that if England's current crop of promising youngsters that are linked with a high profile transfer do make the jump to United (Shaw) / Liverpool (Barkley, Lallana) / Chelsea (Stones), that they are given the competitive game time to continue their development - not just for their own benefit, but for that of the national side as well. Terry Hall, Switzerland England Would Be Special Why can't the FA just give Jose Mourinho a shed load of cash, and promise him a knighthood when he wins us the World Cup. Hodgson might be a lovely chap and have all the best intentions, but his football teams have never won anything. All the youth development in the world doesn't make a difference when the manager has no tactical awareness. England look completely devoid of ideas when playing and seem to have had little coaching in how to attack in the final third. To compound it, England set up to allow the opposition to settle into position before every attack commences. It made me sick recently when I read we nearly got Jose for England manager and we ended up with Capello. Imagine England at this tournament with Jose leading it - England certainly wouldn't be out yet. Everybody hates Jose, apart from Chelsea fans I imagine. If he was managing England and getting us to the World Cup final he would be a national hero. Jim (for the record, not a Chelsea fan), Canterbury Shape Of Things To Come This might have already been said - if not, it should have - but England are not going to get any better in the next two years unless things change. We're out of another competition and it's the same old story. In two years time, the situation will be exactly the same; we'll qualify relatively easily (one or two dodgy away matches aside) and go into the Euros in decent form. Some of our players will have had good domestic seasons and there will be a quiet optimism that we can perform well. Sound familiar? That's pretty much the story for almost every tournament since Euro 96. We always kid ourselves into believing that we're on the cusp of another "golden generation", as if to say: "Don't worry about this tournament lads, it's the next one that counts. You'll be better for this experience." But we won't, at least not until things change. We need to stop relying on the supposed quality of our players and start putting more emphasis on effective tactics and systems. Look at the Dutch team; how many of those players would you say are superstars? Robben and van Persie are really the only ones that fit the bill. Of the rest, you've got Leroy Fer (relegated last season), Krul, De Guzman, Vorm and Vlaar (finished 10th, 12th & 15th with Newcastle, Swansea & Villa respectively). Plus four from Feyenoord, who got knocked out in the playoffs of the Europa League. Yet see how well they play. They have got their game plan spot on - even without van Persie in the line-up they weren't affected; if anything they defended better. The same goes for teams like Chile, USA, Mexico, Ghana, Costa Rica, Columbia etc. (success being relative, of course). It doesn't matter how good we think Luke Shaw, Raheem Sterling, Phil Jones, Ross Barkley et al are going to be; if we don't get the system right, it's moot. You can have the best players in world football in your team but if you don't use them in the right way you're still going to struggle. Case in point, Portugal; they have the Ballon D'Or winner in their team, and they've only got one point, having scored just twice. It's time to start actually planning how to deal with the opposition - learning to exploit their weaknesses and defend against their strengths. Enough of just chucking whichever flavours of the week aren't injured into some random formation and hoping for the best. If it means dropping players like Rooney or Gerrard, or bringing in players from less "fashionable" teams then so be it. I'm not saying we have no chance in the Euros but unless lessons are learned from both other countries, and from this tournament in general, then it's all just a little bit of history repeating. Ted, Manchester Foster And Bentley Deserve Credit Usually I'm with Nick Miller when he writes columns but on this occasion I think he is so desperate to play devil's advocate to the accepted norm that he has confused his own argument. I agree that if a player doesn't feel pride in representing his country then he shouldn't force/fake it but equally he should make it clear that he does not want to be considered for selection rather than taking up a position that a player who wants to play could take. I have much more respect for a Ben Foster, even as with many fans I'll never understand why you wouldn't want to play, being honest about it and requesting he isn't selected than a player who accepts the call-up then doesn't bother or pulls out at every available opportunity. The Foster issue is also hugely different to David Bentley's situation. While few football fans could understand why a footballer would ever give up that life/career to many it is probably just a job that pays the bills and many of us hate our jobs, perhaps do a half-arsed job but go into work every day and pick up the pay cheque regardless. So I don't blame Bentley for that even if it would piss me off to see him continue to pick up a wage at my club and provide nothing in return. If he chooses not to even do that then he deserves some credit. To confuse either of these issues with Capello missing his son's wedding or a player wanting to miss an international because his partner is expecting is nonsense and Redknapp knew this when he stuck his oar in and Nick should see this as well and call it for the petty, pathetic score settling that it is. He wasn't appealing for paternity leave for footballers, he was kicking Hodgson and the FA when they were down. These are legitimate reasons for missing a game/work and should be treated as such so if any attitude needs to change it is for these reasons not dead grannies or fake injuries or lack of pride. Also what is with this 'Suarez has had one good season' nonsense that seems to be sneaking into the mailbox as if it is fact? The guy scored 23 goals two years ago to go with his 31 this year despite missing 10 games, that's 54 goals in 66 games. He has a one in two record at international level and was top scorer in the qualifying campaign having been named player of the tournament at the last Copa America and having an excellent 2010 World Cup. All that without including his phenomenal record at Ajax (as we all know goals in countries other than Spain, Germany, Italy, France and especially England do not count). The guy has been superb for at least the past four years and has been getting better and better year on year and the figures being rumoured are therefore absolutely fair. Regards, Lindsay, Melbourne. Neymar: He's Quite Good How good was Neymar last night?! Yes he scored two good goals, but the most impressive things I saw from him were: - Tireless running to chase down loose balls and pressurise defenders. He is clearly not a lazy flair player. - Tricks and flicks being attempted. Some came off - there was a brilliant little flick off the outside of his right foot as he pirouetted to the left at the end of the first half which almost set up an awesome goal. But it's the fact that he kept trying them that made me most impressed; no England players would have attempted a rainbow kick from just outside the box. - No f***ying about! He got a bit of a kicking, but was generally straight back up again. Didn't go to ground as easily as most players have been doing at this WC. I know it was 'only' Cameroon, but I thought he was ace. Ian (Aberdeen kick off their Europa League season next week, jeez!) Towns, MUFC Slow And Steady Wins The Race In response to Andy, London, who wrote in to highlight how the World Cup is usually won by a slow starter - I couldn't agree more. I have been evangelising this truth for the past weeks to a somewhat uninterested & stubborn audience. Most of my mates watched the first round of games and immediately concluded that the semi-finalists would be Holland, Brazil, Germany, Argentina. I too wondered if they have never watched a World Cup before. It's a hard concept to explain but it just almost always turns out that way. The thing with a tournament like the World Cup is that, firstly, it is just that - a tournament, and not a league. Five goals in your first game doesn't give you any advantage over a team that draws their first two games and scraps through by an own-goal in the third group game. Also, it is very difficult to keep up the type of pace Holland (for example) started with for seven games - heck its hard in any part of the world to go seven games unbeaten. You can lose one game in the first three and still survive, but losing one game in the last four is the end of the road. Hence, a team can't afford to have a bad game in the second two weeks, but can afford to have a bad game in the first two weeks, learn your mistakes and power on from there. Your opposition gets tougher as the tournament progresses too and someone will have studied your technique by the time you get to the QF/SF stage. The chances of injuries and suspensions increase and the loss of a key defender to suspension/injury just means one mistake from a newcomer playing their first game of the tournament means the end of a World Cup for you. There is no goal difference factor later. There are just so many variables involved - nine points from the first three games means very little. That said, it's been a belter of a World Cup. Lee (Scrap the Qatar idea and just have Brazil 2022) Moyo, Durban. Portugal: No Better Than Wales Loath as I am to defend our greasy friend, its fairly obvious that Ronaldo is not fully fit. The cross was a moment of magic which we all know he's capable of. Expect to see hissy fits galore from Bale in the Euro qualifiers with the quality of his team-mates play, as I'd have Wales on a par with Portugal, possibly better than them with Ramsey in the team.

Premier League: Southampton's Jay Rodriguez plans return from injury | Football365 | Premier League News	Jay Rodriguez says the prospect of facing former club Burnley in December is helping his motivation to return from injury as quickly as possible. Last Updated: 23/06/14 at 11:37 Post Comment Jay Rodriguez: Looking forward to Southamptonâs game at Burnley The Southampton forward suffered a serious knee injury in April which ended his chances of going to the World Cup with England. The initial prognosis was that Rodriguez would be sidelined for around six months, and he has been pleased with the early part of his recovery. Rodriguez has now vowed to keep working hard in his rehabilitation to make sure he comes back quickly, and has set his sights on the trip to Turf Moor on 13 December as a game he does not want to miss. âI want to be able to be fit to play in that and go back to Burnley. That is certainly my aim,â he said in the Lancashire Telegraph. âI havenât got a specific comeback date from injury and it is just about working through the phases at the moment. I think there are six phases to the recovery and when we get to stage six we can start looking at putting a timescale on it.Â  âBut seeing the Burnley fixture in December definitely helps with motivation and I really want to play a part.Â  âIt will be great to go back and see all the fans and be able to play at Turf Moor again and see some of the players and people at the club.Â  âThe Burnley game was the first fixture I looked out for.Â  âI am starting to see some positives with me knee and I am feeling good about the recovery. Hopefully it will go to plan.âÂ  Rodriguez is looking forward to working under Ronald Koeman when he returns to fitness, having seen the Dutchman take charge at St Maryâs following Mauricio Pochettinoâs move to Tottenham Hotspur. âI met Ronald Koeman very briefly,â added Rodriguez. âHe is obviously a legend in the game and played at the very highest level. I am excited about working with him. âHe asked me how the injury was and how I was getting on. It was only a very brief chat but it was nice to be able to meet him.Â  âI canât wait to get back training again and working with him and hopefully it will be a good move for Southampton to bring him in.âÂ 	sports
World Cup: Frank Lampard unsure over England future after Costa Rica draw | News	Frank Lampard remains unsure over his international future after Englandâs World Cup campaign limped to a conclusion with a 0-0 draw against Costa Rica. Last Updated: 24/06/14 at 20:39 Post Comment Frank Lampard: Veteran midfielder captained England in 0-0 draw with Costa Rica The veteran midfielder, who will end his long association with Chelsea this summer, captained the side but could not lead them to victory over Costa Rica, who progress to the last 16 as Group D winners with England at the bottom of the table. With Lampard now 36, it is likely to have been his final World Cup appearance, but he insists he is yet to decide when he will call time on his career with the Three Lions. When asked about his future, he told ITV: "I don't know. I really enjoyed being involved and I love playing for my country, that's obvious. I am 36 and still doing it. "I feel fresh. If I feel I can offer something I will do but at the moment it is too soon to say." Lampard agreed with Roy Hodgsonâs post-match assessment that England had been the better side and could have won the game comfortably had they taken the opportunities they created, while also paying tribute to the support of the travelling fans. He added: "It was a difficult game to approach. "I think we did everything we could do. We showed a bit of character, we prepared right for the last two days. Everyone knows how tough it's been.

Hazard Still Guilty Of Flattering To Deceive | Mediawatch, Mailbox, Ref365, John Nicholson, Spanish Thing | Football365	Latest Articles Argentina were woeful for large periods of their last-16 tie against Switzerland, but once again a high-profile team just sneaked through. Must do (much) better... With Manchester United said to be in the market for another midfielder, Ian Watson looks at the five possible targets for Louis van Gaal... Such was the clamour over Belgium's 'golden generation' in the build-up to this tournament, it became difficult to make a subjective and unbiased estimation of exactly what we could, or should, expect from Marc Wilmots' side. Due to the pant-wetting over the country's footballing rise (along with Borussia Dortmund they instigated the use of the football 'hipster' renaissance), Belgium were backed into the position of fifth favourites despite having failed to qualify for five consecutive major tournaments following the 2002 World Cup. That seemed wildly optimistic. In truth, Belgium have been largely uninspiring in Brazil. They incredibly managed to take nine points from their three group games despite leading for a total of just 24 minutes, less than half the figure of eliminated Russia. However, he who laughs, laughs longest, and Belgium will take their place in the quarter-finals alongside the other seven group winners. It is still four wins from four. Having been given the kindest of group stage draws, there was hope that Belgium could ease their way into the tournament after an almost impeccable qualification record. In contrast to the above statistic, Belgium trailed for just 39 minutes (away in Croatia) throughout their entire qualification campaign to reach Brazil. Instead, there has been a distinct lethargy to all that the Belgians have attempted, particularly in an attacking sense, as Wilmots has rather been let down by some of his star players. Les Diables have relied on substitutes for three of their four goals, with defender Jan Vertonghen scoring the other. It may sound harsh given their lack of experience on this particular stage but, given that Belgium's five midfielders have moved for a combined Â£118million in the last two years, and 13 of Belgium's squad played in the Champions League last season, should we have expected more? These are no plucky underdogs, and the likes of Kevin de Bruyne, Dries Mertens, Axel Witsel and Romelu Lukaku have almost entirely flattered to deceive. Against USA, the pattern from the group stage continued. Belgium have a squad with far greater ability than their opposition, and yet scraped through. Had Chris Wondolowski been more measured when presented with a last-minute chance in normal time (and the assistant referee less flag-happy), it could have been an evening with an entirely different ending. Even when Belgium looked to have gained some breathing space in extra-time, the clichÃ© of the Hollywood sports film threatened to create a 2014 soccer version of Mighty Ducks. It has been a glorious fortnight for football in America, and they signed off from the tournament in memorable fashion. At the epicentre of such Belgian disappointment sits Eden Hazard. In a tournament dominated by individuals acting as the catalyst for their team's success (Lionel Messi, Neymar, James Rodriguez), this was the opportunity for Hazard to shake off a season tinged with discontent at Stamford Bridge. It remains a chance yet to be seized. Jose Mourinho criticised Hazard in May for his apparent lack of work rate, and evident bugbear of the Portuguese coach. "He's not the kind of player ready to sacrifice himself 100 per cent for the team and his mates. I'm not happy." To make matters wors, those stinging words were mirrored before this tournament by his international manager. "He [Hazard] can do a lot for us, everyone knows that. Now I'm waiting to see it. I'm waiting for him to take hold of a match and impose himself, even if he's still young to be doing that." Both men are right to increase their demands of Hazard. Although he has been excellent in patches since his Â£32m move from Lille, this is a player that is no longer merely a prospect in football terms. He will turn 24 in January, and must now start producing on a continued basis. That may sound incredibly unforgiving, but Hazard in only judged by the standards that he has set himself. Speaking before the match on Tuesday, the player admitted that he wished to emulate the best. "I have looked at what the other stars have done and try to take as much inspiration from them as possible.Have I been impressed by Lionel Messi, Neymar and James Rodriguez? Of course I have. I know you will see the best Eden." It is not the first time Hazard has mentioned being considered as the best player in the world. "I realise that I can compete with Messi and Ronaldo in the near future, if I put in some more effort." There's that issue of work rate, again. Against USA, Hazard was continuously criticised for his lack of assistance for Jan Vertonghen at full-back. American substitute DeAndre Yedlin was prasied for his attacking endeavour, but his task was made easier by Hazard's constant refusal to track back will have infuriated his manager, especially as the one time he noticeably ran alongside, pressurised and eventually tackled his man, a chance for the sprightly Divock Origi was immediately created. To be spoken of in the same breath as the best, Hazard now needs to be grabbing not just matches but entire competitions by the scruff of the neck. Ronaldo's 17 goals helped Real Madrid finally achieve La Decima, whilst Messi has been at the heart of all that Argentina have accomplished during this World Cup. The same cannot be said of Belgium's no. 10, and a quarter-final tie with Argentina provides the ideal opportunity for part redemption. Daniel Storey - Follow him on Twitter	sports
Individual Brilliance Needs Support From The Sides | Mediawatch, Mailbox, Ref365, John Nicholson, Spanish Thing | Football365	Latest Articles Belgium continued their rather haphazard route through the competition with extra-time victory over USA, but Eden Hazard continues to be slightly uninspiring... With Manchester United said to be in the market for another midfielder, Ian Watson looks at the five possible targets for Louis van Gaal... This has been a noticeably peculiar World Cup in that the football on display has been both mesmerising and hugely exhilarating but, with just nine of the 64 matches remaining, Colombia are the only side that have played to their full potential. It has been a knockout stage in which the supposed favourites have stuttered and stalled, but still found a way. We have had seven last-16 ties so far, and seven group winners have progressed, Germany, Netherlands, France and Brazil all through to the quarter-finals despite concerning under-performance. On Tuesday, Argentina added their name to that list - battered, bruised and distinctly substandard. But through. In fact, this is perhaps one of the reasons that the tournament has been so enthralling. There is little more turgid than a tournament in which the group stage and early knockout ties are simply a prelude or dress rehearsal for the later matches, a sense that we must all wait for the grown-ups to come out and play. Whether it be through the deficiencies of the highest-profile teams or an improvement in the supposed 'weaker' sides, the fact that there have been so few one-sided matches has made for quite excellent viewing. Only three sides have lost games by more than three goals - Spain and Portugal accounted for two of these. With the occasional exception, every team has been forced to work for every goal, point and victory. Against Switzerland, Argentina were no different. Alejandro Sabella's side have wholly failed to impress throughout their four games so far, winning each by a single goal and largely thanks to the wonder of Lionel Messi. The magician scored four and assisted two of his country's six goals in the group stage, but a goal difference of +3 against the likes of Bosnia, Iran and Nigeria has left those at home thoroughly underwhelmed. It seems bizarre given the depth of quality contained within their attacking unit, but Argentina have lacked any meaningful attacking cohesion during their four games so far. The final ball has often been left wanting, and huge possession and territory has failed to produce enough clear-cut chances. Plenty of shots have been attempted, but far too few chances forcing excellent saves or last-ditch tackles have been created. It's hugely surprising given Argentina's threat in qualifying - they scored six more goals than any other South American side. There is little wrong with relying on the brilliance of one individual, particularly when he has the quality that Messi holds, but as the tournament progresses, this only gets harder to achieve as the opposition possesses greater quality. Switzerland were able to utilise Valon Behrami and Gokhan Inler as a man-marking pair, forcing Messi to drop deeper to pick up the ball. Messi actually touched the ball more often in the 90 minutes than in any of the other three matches, but his possession was permitted at arm's length. Of course such a Swiss ploy should have afforded Argentina's alternative forward options greater space, but unfortunately Sabella's supporting acts fluffed their lines yet again. The hamstring injury sustained by the entirely underwhelming Sergio Aguero allowed Ezequiel Lavezzi to seize an opportunity for a consistent starting spot in a team aiming for greatness, but the Paris St Germain forward proved himself an excellent mimic of Aguero - he was the epitome of disinterest and mediocrity. Lavezzi attempted to drift off the flank to search for the ball, but was a passenger for almost all of his 74 minutes on the field. However, whilst Lavezzi's listlessness was disappointing, the performance of Gonzalo Higuain was yet again mystifyingly lacklustre. Higuain was intended to be the spearhead of this potent attack, but has instead looked unfathomably blunt. The Napoli striker has had just three shots on target in the entire tournament - that's a damning statistic for a player with 24 goals for Napoli last season and nine strikes in qualifying, only one fewer than Messi himself. Like Fred for Brazil, there seems a worrying lack of movement from Argentina's no. 9, who completed just 18 passes in 120 minutes - it isn't as if he can claim to be doing his best work outside of the area. Even Angel Di Maria, so often Messi's understudy as inspiration-in-chief, was woefully off-kilter. His passing accuracy of 63% was worse than any other outfield player, and so often the Real Madrid midfielder appeared to make the wrong choice when in possession. His goal to win the game deep into extra-time was an accomplished finish, but that served only to act as a contrast of how second-rate his performance had otherwise been. Until now this has felt like a World Cup in which individuals have performed better than teams, with Neymar, Messi, James Rodriguez, Thomas Muller and Arjen Robben dragging their sides through adversity. Whilst picking a tournament winner still looks hugely difficult, the country that manages to yield more from their supporting acts will be in a favourable position to achieve glory. For Argentina, that means demanding more from some particularly frustrating forwards. Daniel Storey - Follow him on Twitter	sports
The Page That Thinks Twice | Football365 | Mediawatch	Latest Articles The Daily Mail exclusively reveal a new nationality for Morgan Schneiderlin, Martin Samuel argues that being English should not be a crime and Philippe Senderos is an unlikely hero... Just 'how close' did Cristiano Ronaldo come to winning the World Cup. This is certainly the day in Ronaldo's career that Mediawatch will remember... Note to Glenn Hoddle Al Jazeera: A Qatar-based broadcaster. Algeria: A country in North Africa with a team at the World Cup. Spot The Liverpool Fan How Antony Kastrinakis begins his report on France's last-16 victory in The Sun: 'PAUL POGBA showed Manchester United once again yesterday what a cock-up it was to let him go.' Rain On Your Wedding Day Mediawatch is sobbing while it's writing these words, but we do kind of, almost, possibly, agree-ish with Adrian Durham on MailOnline in his view that Liverpool are partly to blame for Luis Suarez's behaviour because they fed his ego (though we would not be so crass as to cite Bill Shankly). And then we read these words: 'The irony is that the points dropped in the games Suarez missed because of suspension at the start of last season cost Liverpool the title. That ban came back to bite Liverpool on the shoulder.' Erm, sorry, what? No Adrian, the points dropped in the final weeks against Chelsea and Crystal Palace - when Suarez was very much available - are clearly what cost Liverpool the title, which was only even vaguely in view because of the Uruguayan's goals. Remember when you smarmily wrote in November that 'if there is any justice and sentiment left in football, Liverpool will be champions come May'? Mentions of sticking by Suarez last summer having 'damaged the reputation of this special club' were oddly absent that particular day. Biting Hypocrisy Adrian Durham on Suarez, July 1: 'And then, just when it looked like Uruguay were going out of the tournament, frustration set in and Suarez's 'God status' was threatened. He lashed out, he regressed to childhood and bit an opponent. Again.' Adrian Durham on Gary Lineker at the 1986 World Cup, July 1: 'England were 2-1 down in the quarter-final to Argentina in 1986, and late in the game John Barnes sends over a delicious cross to give Lineker a golden chance to equalise. 'But desperate to protect his no yellow cards boast, he bottled it, and Argentina cleared. Lineker should have cheated: by that stage of the game every England player knew Diego Maradona had scored with his hand, so Lineker should have cheated too. Elbow the defender out of the way, or put the ball in with your hand - just do whatever it takes to get that ball over the line and keep England in the World Cup.' 'Do whatever it takes'? Like bite an opponent and maybe cause a reaction that could have won a match-saving penalty, perhaps? Gone But Not Forgotten The Daily Mirror have come up with an '11 who waved goodbye to the World Cup but wished they hadn't'. We would have been more impressed if they'd come up with the names of 11 players who were frankly chuffed it was all over. Easy Rider Mediawatch makes no apologies for once again quoting Martin Samuel from April 2013 when he wrote about Luis Suarez following his biting of Branislav Ivanovic: 'The FA is increasingly a rogue regime in need of monitoring. Flushed with the success of banning Luis Suarez for 10 games for an offence that previously received a yellow card, the FA wishes to further nail its other racist bogeyman: John Terry.' Fast-forward to July 2014 and Samuel writes in the Daily Mail that Suarez was 'given a pathetically easy ride from those in his camp' who argued against his latest FIFA ban. Note to Suarez defenders: You can only give him a 'pathetically easy ride' when you're trying to make a point about your beloved John Terry. What A Difference A Terrible Season Makes The sheer volume of words/nonsense being produced by Martin Samuel in Brazil gives us no choice but to once again turn to the Daily Mail with a sigh. This time it's Samuel on 'game-changer' Louis van Gaal, who will replace the 'forlorn' David Moyes at Manchester United. Samuel seems quite taken with Van Gaal and his fancy substituting ways, so it's worth quoting the final lines of his piece on the Dutchman in their entirety: 'Jose Mourinho is regarded as one of the most inspired game managers in football and Van Gaal is the coach who he says was his greatest influence. Ferguson, the man whose feats the Dutchman must aspire to as Manchester United manager, was never shy of the bold gesture either. 'In this way, already, Van Gaal seems a more natural fit than the instinctively cautious Moyes. United fell behind 20 times and recovered to win on four occasions under Moyes. By contrast, Holland have come back from behind three times already just at this World Cup. 'It would appear United have found their man.' Which is odd because Samuel was extremely vociferous in his support for the 'instinctively cautious' Moyes last year, largely because he was instinctively cautious. Oh, and British. The 2013 Samuel wrote: 'So is the Steady Eddie who produced this (Everton) team, often the antithesis of the risk-takers and game-makers of Manchester United, the man to succeed Ferguson at Old Trafford? Yes, he is; of course he is.' In the same piece, which bizarrely claimed that 'English football deserves' the Scot being appointed United manager, Samuel claimed that 'it is United's obligation to lead the way and halt this obsession with foreign as better'. A terrible year for United later...will Van Gaal halt your own obsession with 'British is better', Martin? Headlines Of The Day 'HERR FLICK' - The Sun on Andre Schurrle's cheeky finish. 'Deschamps the miracle worker spearheads revival of Moody Bleus' - The Daily Telegraph. Worst Headline Of The Day 'ATLETI-GO IN FOR AL' - The Daily Star. Bizarre Football Story Of The Day 'You'd imagine it would be a moment that Mauricio Pinilla would never want to re-live, his 119th minute shot cannoning off the crossbar instead of nestling into the net inches below. However instead of trying to forget the fact that he came so close to scoring the last-minute winner that would have knocked out Brazil and sent an entire nation into despair, the Chile striker has had it immortalised forever in a tattoo on his back' - The Independent. Non-Football Story Of The Day A man walked into a bank and defecated out of his shorts several times. He was said to be middle-aged and well-to-do with a "calm but angry" look. Customer Garreth McCarthy said: "I was just queuing up, there were about a dozen customers there, and this guy walked in. He looked pretty well to do. He was a middle-aged man, in his 40s, wearing shorts and trainers, and he had a bald head. He didn't say anything at all, but you can tell from his face he looked angry . Staff shut the Barclays in Andover, Hants, while the mess was cleaned up. Garreth added: "I wasn't really paying attention until I noticed a foul, but unmistakable smell. I looked at the guy and he was just calmly walking around the bank - going to all the areas he could. It's quite clear what he was doing - he just had this calm but angry look on his face, as he walked around leaving special deposits on the floor. And then as calmly as he walked in he left. Staff didn't know what on earth had just happened. The stench was unreal." A Barclays spokesman declined to comment' - Daily Mirror. Thanks to today's spotter Joe Bingham.

Transfer news: Newcastle United sign Siem de Jong from Ajax | Football365 | Premier League News	Newcastle have completed the signing of midfielder Siem de Jong from Ajax on a six-year contract for an undisclosed fee. Last Updated: 01/07/14 at 23:15 Post Comment Siem de Jong: Dutchman joins Newcastle from Ajax The 25-year-old, who can also operate as a striker, wrapped up his move to the Magpies after leaving Ajaxâs pre-season training camp in Austria to undergo a medical and agree personal terms. De Jong, who is seen as a replacement for Yohan Cabaye at St Jamesâ Park, had one year remaining on his deal with the Dutch club but is keen to play in the Premier League. He has spent his entire career with Ajax, for whom he was appointed captain in summer 2012, and has played in the Champions League and Europa League. He has made six appearances for the Netherlands but is not part of the World Cup squad in Brazil. Â  His brother Luuk de Jong was on loan at Newcastle from Borussia Monchengladbach in the second half of last season but the Magpies decided against signing him on a permanent deal after he failed to impress. After putting pen to paper, Siem de Jong, who will cost Â£6million according to some reports, told Newcastle's official website: "It is great to have signed for Newcastle. It is a big club which my brother told me all about, so I already feel good here. "I had been at Ajax a long time and wanted a new challenge in a new environment and a new country. "Coming to Newcastle is a great opportunity and the chance to play for a club like this in the Premier League was one I could not turn down. "I am looking forward to starting training and meeting my new team-mates and hopefully we can have a successful season." Newcastle manager Alan Pardew said: "We are absolutely overjoyed to bring Siem to the club because he will give us intelligence in the final third and create goalscoring situations, which we lacked towards the end of last season. "It is a big signing for this club. Siem brings massive experience from Ajax, I think our fans are going to enjoy the way he plays and I cannot wait to start working with him."

Individual Brilliance Needs Support From The Sides | F365 Says	Latest Articles Belgium continued their rather haphazard route through the competition with extra-time victory over USA, but Eden Hazard continues to be slightly uninspiring... Should Joachim Low be concerned or are Germany just hoping to peak in time for the business end of the World Cup? Ian Watson isn't convinced... This has been a noticeably peculiar World Cup in that the football on display has been both mesmerising and hugely exhilarating but, with just nine of the 64 matches remaining, Colombia are the only side that have played to their full potential. It has been a knockout stage in which the supposed favourites have stuttered and stalled, but still found a way. We have had seven last-16 ties so far, and seven group winners have progressed, Germany, Netherlands, France and Brazil all through to the quarter-finals despite concerning under-performance. On Tuesday, Argentina added their name to that list - battered, bruised and distinctly substandard. But through. In fact, this is perhaps one of the reasons that the tournament has been so enthralling. There is little more turgid than a tournament in which the group stage and early knockout ties are simply a prelude or dress rehearsal for the later matches, a sense that we must all wait for the grown-ups to come out and play. Whether it be through the deficiencies of the highest-profile teams or an improvement in the supposed 'weaker' sides, the fact that there have been so few one-sided matches has made for quite excellent viewing. Only three sides have lost games by more than three goals - Spain and Portugal accounted for two of these. With the occasional exception, every team has been forced to work for every goal, point and victory. Against Switzerland, Argentina were no different. Alejandro Sabella's side have wholly failed to impress throughout their four games so far, winning each by a single goal and largely thanks to the wonder of Lionel Messi. The magician scored four and assisted two of his country's six goals in the group stage, but a goal difference of +3 against the likes of Bosnia, Iran and Nigeria has left those at home thoroughly underwhelmed. It seems bizarre given the depth of quality contained within their attacking unit, but Argentina have lacked any meaningful attacking cohesion during their four games so far. The final ball has often been left wanting, and huge possession and territory has failed to produce enough clear-cut chances. Plenty of shots have been attempted, but far too few chances forcing excellent saves or last-ditch tackles have been created. It's hugely surprising given Argentina's threat in qualifying - they scored six more goals than any other South American side. There is little wrong with relying on the brilliance of one individual, particularly when he has the quality that Messi holds, but as the tournament progresses, this only gets harder to achieve as the opposition possesses greater quality. Switzerland were able to utilise Valon Behrami and Gokhan Inler as a man-marking pair, forcing Messi to drop deeper to pick up the ball. Messi actually touched the ball more often in the 90 minutes than in any of the other three matches, but his possession was permitted at arm's length. Of course such a Swiss ploy should have afforded Argentina's alternative forward options greater space, but unfortunately Sabella's supporting acts fluffed their lines yet again. The hamstring injury sustained by the entirely underwhelming Sergio Aguero allowed Ezequiel Lavezzi to seize an opportunity for a consistent starting spot in a team aiming for greatness, but the Paris St Germain forward proved himself an excellent mimic of Aguero - he was the epitome of disinterest and mediocrity. Lavezzi attempted to drift off the flank to search for the ball, but was a passenger for almost all of his 74 minutes on the field. However, whilst Lavezzi's listlessness was disappointing, the performance of Gonzalo Higuain was yet again mystifyingly lacklustre. Higuain was intended to be the spearhead of this potent attack, but has instead looked unfathomably blunt. The Napoli striker has had just three shots on target in the entire tournament - that's a damning statistic for a player with 24 goals for Napoli last season and nine strikes in qualifying, only one fewer than Messi himself. Like Fred for Brazil, there seems a worrying lack of movement from Argentina's no. 9, who completed just 18 passes in 120 minutes - it isn't as if he can claim to be doing his best work outside of the area. Even Angel Di Maria, so often Messi's understudy as inspiration-in-chief, was woefully off-kilter. His passing accuracy of 63% was worse than any other outfield player, and so often the Real Madrid midfielder appeared to make the wrong choice when in possession. His goal to win the game deep into extra-time was an accomplished finish, but that served only to act as a contrast of how second-rate his performance had otherwise been. Until now this has felt like a World Cup in which individuals have performed better than teams, with Neymar, Messi, James Rodriguez, Thomas Muller and Arjen Robben dragging their sides through adversity. Whilst picking a tournament winner still looks hugely difficult, the country that manages to yield more from their supporting acts will be in a favourable position to achieve glory. For Argentina, that means demanding more from some particularly frustrating forwards. Daniel Storey - Follow him on Twitter	sports
