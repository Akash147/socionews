Football365 - Football News, Views, Gossip and much more...	We cannot imagine this will go down incredibly well with Wayne Rooney but it looks like he will be on the left tonight against Ecuador. "He can do that (role), absolutely," said Hodgson, who also confirmed that Frank Lampard would captain the side and James Milner would start at right-back. "I think Wayne's a very useful player in the sense you don't have to pin him down and say this is the only position he can play." The debate continues...	sports

The Afternoon Gossip | Football Transfer Rumours and Gossip | Football365	Barca plan £56m move for Aguero, City close to securing £15m Fernando, Arsenal target Morata to join Juve, and... Last Updated: 03/06/14 at 16:32 Post Comment Latest Articles Chelsea in pole position for Fabregas, Spurs target three defensive recruits, Bony to cost Arsenal £19m and more... Adam Lallana needs to put in a transfer request to force through Reds move, Balotelli to Arsenal and Cesc to City... All the rumours from Tuesday morning are here... BARCELONA PLOT AGUERO BID It looks like Barcelona won't take 'no' for an answer in their chase for Sergio Aguero. According to the Daily Star, the Catalan club are preparing a bid of £56m for the striker, who is also attracting interest from Real Madrid. Aguero's father told COPE radio that his son prefers a move to Barcelona last week, but added that Manchester City are unlikely to let him leave. The Star report: 'New Barcelona manager Luis Enrique has made the 26-year-old his No.1 summer target. 'Cesc Fabregas and Alexis Sanchez are set to leave Barcelona during the close season and Enrique wants to use the funds raised through their sales to finance a deal for Aguero.' FERNANDO SET FOR CITY Manchester City are close to sealing a £15m move for Porto midfielder Fernando, report the Daily Mirror. The 26-year-old was tipped for a deadline-day switch to the Etihad in February, but the transfer fell through at the eleventh hour. A deal for Fernando has now been resurrected, though, with City also chasing his teammate Eliaquim Mangala. MORATA WANTS JUVE MOVE After months of speculation linking Alvaro Morata with a move to Arsenal, it seems the Real Madrid forward is now on his way to Juventus. The Daily Express claim that Real are planning to use the 21-year-old as bait in their bid to bring Arturo Vidal to the Santiago Bernabeu. Apparently Carlo Ancelotti sees Vidal as the perfect replacement for the ageing Xabi Alonso, and is willing to let Morata go to secure a transfer. STOKE CLOSING ON DIOUF Stoke are closing in on their second signing of the summer after already completing a deal for Sunderland's Phil Bardsley. The next target on Mark Hughes' wish list is former Manchester United striker Mame Biram Diouf, who was close to joining the Potters last summer. Diouf has caught Hughes' eye after scoring 33 goals in 68 games for Hannover over the past two seasons and it's thought a transfer is close to completion. "We're hopeful that Diouf will be done," Stoke chairman Peter Coates told the BBC. AND THE REST Roberto Martinez has revealed that he has already identified who he wants to sign this summer, and is now working on closing several deals...Arsenal face competition for Toulouse right-back Serge Aurier after his agent said the Ivorian is currently in talks with another English club...Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United are all tracking highly-rated MK Dons youngster Dele Alli...Aleksandar Kolarov has emerged as a target for Bayern Munich...Michael Laudrup is planning to return to management with a 'big club'...and finally, there is a tremendous piece of bulls**t doing the rounds that Manchester United want Luis Suarez for £65m. Inventive.	sports

We have lots of World Cup mails so thanks... There are only ten days to go before the biggest event of the football calendar and yet we're still having to publish emails about Arsene Wenger.

Despite cruising to a 3-0 win against Peru, England didn't show a great deal to support Matt Stanger's view that they'll get out of the group. He's waiting to judge Wayne Rooney... It's unlikley Peru will provide a similar test to Uruguay simply because they are from the same confederation, but the most important thing for England is to avoid costly injuries...

Ashley Cole showing a genuine emotion, Kallstrom's last match and Newcastle fans actually wanting their club to be run in an ethical manner. These are heady times indeed... It was a performance that encapsulated everything that Mourinho stands for and desires. On a sunny morning in Liverpool, Jose came, he saw and he ruined the party... It's easy to criticise Mike Dean for another catalogue of errors, but he should really be congratulated for such an impressive display of winding-up Rui Faria and Chelsea. Liverpool got the 'fear' at times on Sunday, but Vincent Kompany was there to allow the little kid to carry on sprinting. The sort of mistake that wins or loses a title race...	sports

The Page That Is Planning More Treats | Football365 | Mediawatch	Latest Articles 'Man reminds other men to sing (even though there's no indication they've forgotten)' is the headline on several back pages while Daniel Sturridge has been 'forcing' Roy Hodgson to play him... Which journo has claimed an exclusive on the Lambert story despite citing The Guardian elsewhere? And Robbie Savage thinks that Tim Sherwood is more magic than Harry Potter... Wrong, Wrong, Wrong Ian Wright has launced a staunch defence of Danny Welbeck in The Sun as he struggles to grasp why some fans don't want to see the forward in England's first XI. 'People are constantly having a pop at him but there's not a lot of foundation to that beyond the fact United had such a nightmare season,' writes Wright. 'Of course, he might miss a couple of chances here and there...' A couple of chances, Ian? Only 13 goals in 77 appearances for United over the last two seasons suggests he's missed a lot more than that. Of course, there's still a strong case for Welbeck to start for England, but what irks Mediawatch is Wright's refusal to acknowledge the debate is justified while simultaneously participating in said debate. 'In many ways it's just like bullying,' continues Wright on the 'head-scratching' opposition to Welbeck's inclusion. 'There's just no substance to it beyond the fact he plays for United - nothing more than that.' However, Wrighty then concedes: 'I can see why people want to see Sterling in there...' So which is it, Ian? An illogical view based purely on club tribalism, or just standard pre-World Cup discussion, which you're clearly happy to entertain despite insisting there is no debate to be had? Big Draw 'We are an Ecuadraw' boasts the headline in The Sun as they preview Wednesday's warm-up game. Writes Charlie Wyett: 'England are set to play in front of a 20,000-plus crowd against Ecuador in Miami tomorrow. 'An official at Sun Life Stadium - home to the Miami Dolphins - said: "We were hoping for up to 30,000. But it's not bad as the game will be played in working hours." 'The ageing stadium can hold up to 76,000 but large sections will be sealed off. Tickets start at £20.' So apart from anticipating an extra 10,000 fans, and having to seal off some 50,000 seats despite reasonable prices, it certainly looks like England are a big (Ecua)draw. Durham As seems to be the trend on Tuesday, Adrian Durham sticks up for his England favourite on the MailOnline, insisting that Wayne Rooney is still the best player available to Roy Hodgson. His entire premise is detailed in four bullet points at the top of the page - which the Mail now attach to every article for those who can't be bothered to read - but Mediawatch still scrolled to the very bottom so you don't have to. 'When I read Mick Channon describing Rooney as the 'weak link' on Sportsmail last week I was shocked,' writes Durham. 'The former Manchester City and Southampton striker is right that Rooney hasn't delivered at a World Cup, but he's only the weak link if he offers less than the rest. 'Rooney doesn't deserve the criticism. He has earned the right with performances and goals for his club and country for us all to debate how to get the best out of him, rather than lazily writing him off.' How very noble. You can say what you like about Adrian Durham - and Mediawatch has said it all - but if there's one thing you'll never catch him doing it's lazily writing someone off. He'd never...oh, what's that? From July 2013: 'You're Carlo Ancelotti. You're deciding who would be the better signing - Wayne Rooney or Luis Suarez. It's a no-brainer. Rooney is miles ahead. 'In fact I wonder how good Luis Suarez actually is. He's got quality and ability - probably more than most. But looking good in the Dutch league and standing out in one of the most average Liverpool sides I've seen in my lifetime does not constitute a top-level player.' Ah, just when we thought we could be friends. Friends Headline on the MailOnline (we'll let you guess who penned the article): 'Chelsea would have won more friends if model pro Frank Lampard had been captain rather than tarnished John Terry.' Yes, because that's what competitive sport is about. And Finally... 'How dare Southampton hold Adam Lallana back?' Oh God, no more Durham. Ever. Please. Like Rain On Your Wedding Day Writes Dave Kidd in the Daily Mirror: 'There's a certain irony in the fact that Spurs have told Mauricio Pochettino he must speak English in press conferences, having sacked Tim Sherwood for speaking too much plain English in press conferences.' Two things: 1) Tim Sherwood wasn't sacked for 'speaking too much plain English'. He was sacked owing to a dreadful record against Spurs' top-four rivals and because he was accused of having lost the players' confidence. 2) That isn't ironic. Exclusively Bulls**t '16 CLUBS CHASE FRANK', booms the 'WORLD EXCLUSIVE' on the back page of The Sun, with scribe Andrew Dillon writing: 'Frank Lampard is the world's most wanted player with 16 clubs chasing him.' Wow, 16 clubs. We'd love to know who they are, and surely The Sun are prepared to divulge that information given that it's a 'WORLD EXCLUSIVE'. Otherwise, isn't this just another story saying Lampard has options? 'Italians Fiorentina and clubs in Qatar and Brazil have added their names to the long list of teams who want to land him,' Dillon continues. 'LA Galaxy have re-emerged as contenders as well, along with the MLS' newest franchise New York City. 'And, as SunSport exclusively revealed last week, Lamps' uncle, QPR boss Harry Redknapp, is desperate to lure the Blues legend after winning promotion to the top flight.' Mediawatch makes that four clubs The Sun have named in their 'WORLD EXCLUSIVE'. There must be an awful lot of teams in Qatar and Brazil. West West End Report the Daily Mirror: 'Spurs midfielder Paulinho has reacted to Chelsea dropping their interest in him by insisting he never wanted to quit White Hart Lane. 'The Brazilian World Cup star, who made it clear he wanted out of the club after a spell on the bench under Tim Sherwood, said: "I never considered returning to Brazil. It never crossed my mind."' He knows Chelsea are based just down the road, right? One To Keep Your Eye On 'Sergio Aguero is going nowhere this summer - after Manchester City ruled out a sale' - The Sun. 'Manchester City will not sell Sergio Aguero - even for a world-record fee' - the Daily Mirror. Mediawatch couldn't be more certain that's the last we'll hear of Aguero's links to Real Madrid... Joyful Father-To-Be Of The Day Said Philippe Senderos on the birth of his child: "I can only pray that the baby arrives once I am home from Brazil." Good to know he's got his priorities straight.

The 26-year-old phone user was text messaging his partner for a number of hours while in bed. 'But his excessive messaging led to him suffering from sudden flashes in his eyesight.

A Sterling Stick To Use On Hodgson... | F365 Says	It's very, very easy to write a column saying that the latest Bright Young Thing should start for England...but thankfully England have a manager and not an X Factor-style vote... Last Updated: 03/06/14 at 16:00 Post Comment Latest Articles ...that makes Rickie Lambert a good fit at Liverpool, says Adam Bate. He clearly does offer a Plan B but he's good enough to fit in with the Plan A too. It's sound... Roy Hodgson is saddened by England's obsession with Wayne Rooney, but what does he expect? The debate over the striker's inclusion is now more relevant than ever... In March, the Daily Mail's Martin Samuel - never a man shy to state his case against all manner of straw men and 'mistakes' yet to be made - decried the lack of wingers in the England World Cup squad that would not be named for another two months. He screamed for more 'crackerjack wide players', for Raheem Sterling, Andros Townsend, Adam Lallana, Adam Johnson and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to be on the plane to Brazil. 'One minute we bemoan the lack of talent, the next we haven't got room for it all. Make your minds up, gentlemen,' he wrote. We're unsure which anonymous 'gentlemen' he was addressing but presumably he's fuming that Johnson - rather good for five minutes at the turn of the year - was left behind. He should be pleased that Sterling, Lallana and Oxlade-Chamberlain did make the final 23-man squad but instead he's angry again... 'Raheem Sterling needs to start, Roy...England have a long-standing mistrust of talent that needs to end in Brazil,' was the headline on Monday's column, which fumes at the fact that the useful but uninspiring James Milner was brought on ahead of Sterling against Peru on Friday night. That will be Milner (45 caps) brought on ahead of Sterling (two caps) - a point Samuel uses to illustrate England's innate distrust of fancy players, via a whistlestop tour of Matt Le Tissier, Alan Hudson, Rodney Marsh, Stan Bowles, Tony Currie and Peter Osgood. What Samuel - and anyone else clamouring for the very talented but ultimately inexperienced Sterling to leapfrog Milner and Danny Welbeck - fails to recognise is that the Liverpool winger is just 19 and has already been fast-tracked into the senior set-up. Milner and Welbeck were not England internationals at 19; the fact that Sterling is there at all is an acknowledgement that he has a talent that far outweighs his rivals. The question is not whether he will become a better player than either of those hard-working but limited players, but whether he is a better option right now in what would easily be the biggest game of his career against Italy in Manaus. It's incredibly easy to shout for the inclusion of an in-form player - especially when he plays for a club with a large and vociferous fanbase - and it's even easier when the alternatives appear to be so stodgy. There aren't many putting their hands up and pointing out that Welbeck had an incredibly similar strike rate to Sterling this season (nine goals from 45/46 shots) and was excellent against Bayern Munich in the Champions League, while Milner probably has even fewer people in his corner despite two Premier League titles in the last three seasons. Having been robbed of one 'conservative' beating stick by Hodgson's brave and balanced squad selection (conservative would have been to include Ashley Cole, Michael Carrick and Jermain Defoe), the next stick in hand is his reluctance to play the season's in-form XI, with no regard to performances in training, mental aptitude, experience or specific gameplans for specific opponents. Sod all that stuff, just play the kid who looks exciting - it's the easiest column to write as we approach a major tournament. Sterling will start against Ecuador on Wednesday, could well be ruddy marvellous, but still find himself on the bench against Honduras on Saturday and Italy a week later. Hands will be thrown up in the hair and we will wonder whether the same hands were thrown in the air 16 years ago when the precociously talented 18-year-old Michael Owen was left out of the starting line-up as England began their World Cup campaign in France. Two games and two lively substitute appearances later, Owen - now acclimatised to tournament football - came into the England side, along with the similarly untested David Beckham. The England manager that year was Glenn Hoddle, now regularly wheeled out as one of the great sages of the game and a potential saviour of English football. He saved Owen until he was sure he was ready, initially using his pace as an 'option off the bench', a phrase decried by Samuel this week. Hodgson may well decide to start Sterling against Italy - after all, he threw in the similarly youthful Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain two years ago - but should he choose the diligent Welbeck instead, it will be a decision based on rather more than 'who is the better player?' It's why we have a manager and don't choose the England team by public vote. Sarah Winterburn	sports

Amongst the many flaws of his system is the fact that I can't imagine any sane minded Real Madrid fan (for example) getting too excited if Aaron Lennon or Kyle Walker were linked to their club can you? Rob Pearse Cesc Never Won Owt In response to Conor (Honestly, I'm not carrying emotional baggage), Gooner, Dublin. First of all, I totally understand the romance of bringing Cesc back. I even think we could make room for him because, after all, he is a fantastic player. My issue is with the idea that bringing him back would represent the return of some kind of talisman who bought us through so many "bad times". The idea that bringing him back would somehow return us to our former glory. I'd just like to respectfully point out that we won absolutely nothing in the period that Cesc was our captain. It would be nice to heap some praise on those players who have put in the sort of performances that did finally break the drought. Mertesacker, Koscielny, Ramsey, Giroud - all players who came through bad times and now actually have something to show for it. Nothing wrong with a bit of romance but let's have it right, as good as Cesc was, we never saw him lift a trophy. Ben Smith - North Bank. Silly To Swap Ozil I would love nothing more than to have Cesc back in the side. Watching that goal against Tottenham again today reminded me of so many good times when he was at the club. However, swapping Ozil for Fabregas would be silly. Top of our assist charts, one of the biggest summer signings globally, our catalyst for last season and a trophy. Selling him and bringing in Cesc will look (not necessarily be) a step backwards ... So what are the other options? Adding without selling would mean we would be overloaded in midfield. Cazorla? Love him to bits and would hate to see him leave but he is 29 now and Cesc certainly wouldn't be a downgrade. Arteta? Not really a like for like replacement but I felt Arteta has been on the decline this season.. Still sometimes you do need someone to slow the pace of the game down Wilshire? Tricky one this. If Wilshire can get over his injuries he could be world class but he has been out-shined by Ramsey and will surely get less play time next season as a result...However, you do need a certain amount of English players in the Champs squad. And he is very good Ramsey? No I think ultimately no matter how much we love Cesc, I don't think there is a space for him in the squad anymore (i would argue that the only choice would be for Cazorla). It would hurt to see him play for a different english club but I would hope that he would "be injured" whenever he played us Rob (To be honest, I don't think Ozil looked like he enjoyed playing at Real that much either) AFC Anthems To Jae, Tunbridge Wells, who had a pop at "God Save the Queen," just be thankful that you're not from the USA. We've got an anthem that is virtually unsingable (and the tune was written by a man named John Smith, for crying out loud), and whose words are so convoluted that maybe 1 out of 10 Americans can tell you what they actually mean. Almost nobody likes it. I'd be very happy with "God Save the Queen," and in fact we already have it here, only with different words and titled "My Country 'Tis of Thee." But we stick with "The Star Spangled Banner," because...well, because. But what I'd really like is "Il Canto Degli Italiani," the Italian national anthem, an unabashed piece of militarism that's just flat-out fun, in a way that only the Italians can manage. PeterG, Pennsylavnia, USA Zing To add to the Non-English and where we stand on supporting England..... I am from Cardiff, the Capital City of Wales. Support nobody but Cardiff City and Wales but have lived and worked in London for about 5 years. I have just drawn England in my work sweepstake. .............however I do get £16 as a losing finalist! Rob Addressing A Few Points Conor, Dublin Gooner. Apart from not being sure how Man U are Arsenal's "ex best-mate" and how Chelsea are their "younger, richer, more successful neighbour", I didn't think we were allowed to do those "It's like when you're going out with/not going out with/meeting up with when too drunk to realise it's a stupid idea" analogies any more. I mean, it just isn't like that. It's like when a bloke who used to play for your football team went and played for another one. It most assuredly is nothing like having a real girlfriend who then, ah...I see. Moving on. Frank Lampard's "obscene goal output" is largely due to him taking about 150 penalties (guessed) over his career at Chelsea. Given just this, my goal output would be at least "creditable". I'm with you Chris MUFC. I'd have preferred it if we hadn't appealed Rooney's quite-deserved 3 game ban and not taken him to the last tournament. I thought we were doing better without him. Of course, we'll never know but I think we might well be better off now if he were just another 9 as opposed to the supposedly essential and yet clearly detrimental axis around which everything else must be shoe-horned into orbit. In which case, Tom London, I heartily disagree. He's not our "best player" (subjective yet stated as fact). He's been the "essential axis around which everything else must be shoe-horned into orbit" for ten years and considering his position, he bloody well should be our highest goal-scorer and would still be even if he was one of those players who just did their job in a formation (clue, scored goals) rather than being all of that, the second-coming and Gazza on a cracker at the same time. I would rather see this than people (Wazza included) shunted out of position to accommodate him because I'm one of those sane men, women or children who don't believe we'd win the thing with 11 of him. Nobody thinks Welbeck is a better option. Inventing a ridiculous argument that nobody is having to juxtapose your idea doesn't reflect as well upon it as you think. Jae, Tunbridge Wells (disgusted of?) I stopped at the Spanish not needing a good sing-along. Presumably you know that their anthem doesn't have any words (officially) and that quite obviously this is not the most important difference between the lavishly gifted Spain squad and that of the rather more workmanlike stylings of England. Beyond that, I couldn't really what sort of sensible point you might be about to make. Then the asterisks caught my eye and I might have done you a disservice. The bit in between was obviously bollocks but yes, this should be our new national anthem. Ed, Weymouth. Do it mate. I've been to south Dorset. It deserves it. Besides, I like Fearne. Rather more thanks to your capitalised MIDDLE-NAMING of her. Cheers, Jim (I know, not much constructive to offer) Essex Best World Cups Jim, Bali (Coming for your job, Degsy) is right. Get your money on Argentina. I've done a predictor as well and also have them beating Brazil in the final, although I have England going out to Columbia in the 2nd round (due to the stifling heat, Rooney playing like a hod carrier, and Glenn Johnson playing). Regarding favourite past tournaments, Argentina '78 was great partly due to the ticker tape and dark flowing locks of Mario Kempes, but 1982 in Spain comes out tops for me. The atmosphere was intense, and Brazil were unbelievable to watch (all you tiki-taka fans would do well to spend time having a shufty at that team to realise what exciting football really is). I could rhyme off a list of their footballing gods such as Socrates, Falcao, Junior, Zico, plus plenty of their goals which could've been sold off as works of art, and this would easily make my point, but the player who will always stick in my memory was Eder, who made the spectacular seem the norm. Volleys, chips, thunderb*st*rds were almost to be expected when he played. My favourite Eder moment was actually one that he missed, against Argentina, where he takes a lengthy run up not unlike cricketer Michael Holding would have done in his pomp (I can't find the Motson commentary but he chirped something like "And Eder is lining up what looks like a tremendous shot"), meets the ball with the outside of his foot and fires a curving, dipping piledriver which crashes against the bar, leaving Zico an easy tap in. Witness: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCFL1UEJ47M. Mesmerising. Their lack of concentration on defence meant they went out to eventual winners Italy, and a Paulo Rossi hat-trick, in the semis, but at least the Italy/Germany final provided this! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XOL8o-3TZ8. I rest my case. Steve Smith (LFC) Top XIs Re. Bernard (France 98 is still my fave) MUFC Here's my stab at your one country represented world cup XI (plus the full complement 12 on the bench because I like a challenge): GK: Thibaut Courtois - Belgium RB: Pablo Zabaleta - Argentina LB: Philipp Lahm - Germany CB: Sergio Ramos - Spain CB: Raphaël Varane - France DM: Daniele De Rossi - Italy CM: Yaya Touré - Ivory Coast CM: Fernandinho - Brazil RW: Alexis Sánchez - Chile LW: Cristiano Ronaldo - Portugal FW: Luis Suarez - Uruguay Subs: Joe Hart (England), Joël Matip (Cameroon), Stephan Lichtsteiner (Switazerland), Nigel De Jong (Netherlands), Mile Jedinak (Australia), Luka Modrić (Croatia), Fredy Guarín (Colombia), Shinji Kagawa (Japan), Miralem Pjanić (BiH), Javier Hernández (Mexico), Kevin-Prince Boateng (Ghana) , Igor Akinfeev (Russia) Blue Tim (France '98 is also my fav; watched it in a bowling alley in Boulogne on a school trip) ...Bernard (France 98 is still my fave) MUFC's letter is one of those classic World Cup warm-up games. Although, when he said his one Brazilian was a defender I was definitely expecting their best defender. Dante ahead of Silva?! An attempt (4-3-3): Akinfeev (Russia); Abate (Italy), Tiago Silva (Brazil), Kompany (Belgium), Lahm (Germany); Iniesta (Spain), Vidal (Chile), Pogba (France); Suarez (Uruguay), Messi (Argentina), Ronaldo (Portugal). Ok, Akinfeev is very good but probably not a world beater. In front of him though are a back 4 with so much ability I think he'd be safe enough. Joe Hart instead maybe? A midfield with a mix of power, dynamism and brains. And those 3 up front. Might not pass to each other a lot, but shouldn't need to. Paraic (Who should I support?), Ireland	sports

However, swapping Ozil for Fabregas would be silly. Top of our assist charts, one of the biggest summer signings globally, our catalyst for last season and a trophy. Selling him and bringing in Cesc will look (not necessarily be) a step backwards ... So what are the other options? Adding without selling would mean we would be overloaded in midfield. Cazorla? Love him to bits and would hate to see him leave but he is 29 now and Cesc certainly wouldn't be a downgrade. Arteta? Not really a like for like replacement but I felt Arteta has been on the decline this season.. Still sometimes you do need someone to slow the pace of the game down Wilshire? Tricky one this. If Wilshire can get over his injuries he could be world class but he has been out-shined by Ramsey and will surely get less play time next season as a result...However, you do need a certain amount of English players in the Champs squad. And he is very good Ramsey? No I think ultimately no matter how much we love Cesc, I don't think there is a space for him in the squad anymore (i would argue that the only choice would be for Cazorla). It would hurt to see him play for a different english club but I would hope that he would "be injured" whenever he played us Rob (To be honest, I don't think Ozil looked like he enjoyed playing at Real that much either) AFC Anthems To Jae, Tunbridge Wells, who had a pop at "God Save the Queen," just be thankful that you're not from the USA. We've got an anthem that is virtually unsingable (and the tune was written by a man named John Smith, for crying out loud), and whose words are so convoluted that maybe 1 out of 10 Americans can tell you what they actually mean. Almost nobody likes it. I'd be very happy with "God Save the Queen," and in fact we already have it here, only with different words and titled "My Country 'Tis of Thee." But we stick with "The Star Spangled Banner," because...well, because. But what I'd really like is "Il Canto Degli Italiani," the Italian national anthem, an unabashed piece of militarism that's just flat-out fun, in a way that only the Italians can manage. PeterG, Pennsylavnia, USA Zing To add to the Non-English and where we stand on supporting England..... I am from Cardiff, the Capital City of Wales. Support nobody but Cardiff City and Wales but have lived and worked in London for about 5 years. I have just drawn England in my work sweepstake. .............however I do get £16 as a losing finalist! Rob Addressing A Few Points Conor, Dublin Gooner. Apart from not being sure how Man U are Arsenal's "ex best-mate" and how Chelsea are their "younger, richer, more successful neighbour", I didn't think we were allowed to do those "It's like when you're going out with/not going out with/meeting up with when too drunk to realise it's a stupid idea" analogies any more. I mean, it just isn't like that. It's like when a bloke who used to play for your football team went and played for another one. It most assuredly is nothing like having a real girlfriend who then, ah...I see. Moving on. Frank Lampard's "obscene goal output" is largely due to him taking about 150 penalties (guessed) over his career at Chelsea. Given just this, my goal output would be at least "creditable". I'm with you Chris MUFC. I'd have preferred it if we hadn't appealed Rooney's quite-deserved 3 game ban and not taken him to the last tournament. I thought we were doing better without him. Of course, we'll never know but I think we might well be better off now if he were just another 9 as opposed to the supposedly essential and yet clearly detrimental axis around which everything else must be shoe-horned into orbit. In which case, Tom London, I heartily disagree. He's not our "best player" (subjective yet stated as fact). He's been the "essential axis around which everything else must be shoe-horned into orbit" for ten years and considering his position, he bloody well should be our highest goal-scorer and would still be even if he was one of those players who just did their job in a formation (clue, scored goals) rather than being all of that, the second-coming and Gazza on a cracker at the same time. I would rather see this than people (Wazza included) shunted out of position to accommodate him because I'm one of those sane men, women or children who don't believe we'd win the thing with 11 of him. Nobody thinks Welbeck is a better option. Inventing a ridiculous argument that nobody is having to juxtapose your idea doesn't reflect as well upon it as you think. Jae, Tunbridge Wells (disgusted of?) I stopped at the Spanish not needing a good sing-along. Presumably you know that their anthem doesn't have any words (officially) and that quite obviously this is not the most important difference between the lavishly gifted Spain squad and that of the rather more workmanlike stylings of England. Beyond that, I couldn't really what sort of sensible point you might be about to make. Then the asterisks caught my eye and I might have done you a disservice. The bit in between was obviously bollocks but yes, this should be our new national anthem. Ed, Weymouth. Do it mate. I've been to south Dorset. It deserves it. Besides, I like Fearne. Rather more thanks to your capitalised MIDDLE-NAMING of her. Cheers, Jim (I know, not much constructive to offer) Essex Best World Cups Jim, Bali (Coming for your job, Degsy) is right. Get your money on Argentina. I've done a predictor as well and also have them beating Brazil in the final, although I have England going out to Columbia in the 2nd round (due to the stifling heat, Rooney playing like a hod carrier, and Glenn Johnson playing). Regarding favourite past tournaments, Argentina '78 was great partly due to the ticker tape and dark flowing locks of Mario Kempes, but 1982 in Spain comes out tops for me. The atmosphere was intense, and Brazil were unbelievable to watch (all you tiki-taka fans would do well to spend time having a shufty at that team to realise what exciting football really is). I could rhyme off a list of their footballing gods such as Socrates, Falcao, Junior, Zico, plus plenty of their goals which could've been sold off as works of art, and this would easily make my point, but the player who will always stick in my memory was Eder, who made the spectacular seem the norm. Volleys, chips, thunderb*st*rds were almost to be expected when he played. My favourite Eder moment was actually one that he missed, against Argentina, where he takes a lengthy run up not unlike cricketer Michael Holding would have done in his pomp (I can't find the Motson commentary but he chirped something like "And Eder is lining up what looks like a tremendous shot"), meets the ball with the outside of his foot and fires a curving, dipping piledriver which crashes against the bar, leaving Zico an easy tap in. Witness: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCFL1UEJ47M. Mesmerising. Their lack of concentration on defence meant they went out to eventual winners Italy, and a Paulo Rossi hat-trick, in the semis, but at least the Italy/Germany final provided this! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XOL8o-3TZ8. I rest my case. Steve Smith (LFC) Top XIs Re. Bernard (France 98 is still my fave) MUFC Here's my stab at your one country represented world cup XI (plus the full complement 12 on the bench because I like a challenge): GK: Thibaut Courtois - Belgium RB: Pablo Zabaleta - Argentina LB: Philipp Lahm - Germany CB: Sergio Ramos - Spain CB: Raphaël Varane - France DM: Daniele De Rossi - Italy CM: Yaya Touré - Ivory Coast CM: Fernandinho - Brazil RW: Alexis Sánchez - Chile LW: Cristiano Ronaldo - Portugal FW: Luis Suarez - Uruguay Subs: Joe Hart (England), Joël Matip (Cameroon), Stephan Lichtsteiner (Switazerland), Nigel De Jong (Netherlands), Mile Jedinak (Australia), Luka Modrić (Croatia), Fredy Guarín (Colombia), Shinji Kagawa (Japan), Miralem Pjanić (BiH), Javier Hernández (Mexico), Kevin-Prince Boateng (Ghana) , Igor Akinfeev (Russia) Blue Tim (France '98 is also my fav; watched it in a bowling alley in Boulogne on a school trip) ...Bernard (France 98 is still my fave) MUFC's letter is one of those classic World Cup warm-up games. Although, when he said his one Brazilian was a defender I was definitely expecting their best defender. Dante ahead of Silva?! An attempt (4-3-3): Akinfeev (Russia); Abate (Italy), Tiago Silva (Brazil), Kompany (Belgium), Lahm (Germany); Iniesta (Spain), Vidal (Chile), Pogba (France); Suarez (Uruguay), Messi (Argentina), Ronaldo (Portugal). Ok, Akinfeev is very good but probably not a world beater. In front of him though are a back 4 with so much ability I think he'd be safe enough. Joe Hart instead maybe? A midfield with a mix of power, dynamism and brains. And those 3 up front. Might not pass to each other a lot, but shouldn't need to. Paraic (Who should I support?), Ireland	sports

World Cup Group Analysis: Group G - Goal.com	Goal analyzes all the eight groups in this year's world cup. Continuing with our series, we take a look at Group G... SPECIAL By Shikharr Chandra GERMANY Profile Titles: FIFA World Cup (1954, 1974, 1990), Confederations Cup (1999), European Championship (1972, 1980, 1996)  Top Scorer: Miroslav Klose (68) Most Apearances: Lothar Matthaus (150) FIFA Ranking: 2 Star Man: Mario Gotze Appearances: 28 Goals: 7 Formation 4-2-3-1   Coach Part of the German camp for over 10 years now, Joachim Low comes across as one of the most offensive coaches in this summer's tournament. Low, who has led the Germans in the last two European Championships and the 2010 World Cup, which saw his side succumb to pressure during the final few games of each of those tournaments. Low's philosophy is based on quick passing and keeping possession. What would be interesting to note is whether he will play with a false 9 or go with a more direct approach with a center forward in the side. How they set up Die Adler will look to setup in their usual 4-2-3-1 formation with the main aim being to keep the ball and not allow the oppositions to take control of the game. Low, whose German sides were based on quick counter attacks four years ago have completely changed their setup and ball retention now remains the key aspect of their game. It will be interesting to see if Sami Khedira gets a run-in the side considering how little he's played in the seson gone by. Instead, the likes of Toni Kroos and Bastian Schweinsteiger offer much more in that role than the Real Madrid midfielder. The pressing question though, is whether Germany opt for a false nine in Mario Gotze or go for an out and out striker in Miroslav Klose. He has tested the use of a false nine over the last few years now and it is highly likely that the side may use Gotze to fill in that role. Key Players The likes of Gotze, Lukas Podolski, Thomas Muller, Mesut Ozil all add attacking quality to the side and are most likely to provide goals considering the dearth of strikers. The impressive form of defender turned midfielder Phillip Lahm is an encouraging sign for the manager. Lahm spent most of the season as a central midfielder and provides another option in that department. Manuel Neuer, rated as one of the best goalkeepers in the world, will certainly play a key role in ensuring Germany have a successful campaign. Strengths and Weaknesses Germany's major weakness is in their striking department. It is most likely that the side will start with a false nine in Gotze, but Low's experiment has hardly paid off over the past few years where the Germans have looked unconvincing to say the least. The injury to star midfielder Marco Reus comes as a big blow, given that the Dortmund winger was the most in-form German player heading into the tournament. Their midfield though is capable of winning any games. The side has enormous depth and quality to provide both goals and assists and bail them out from pressure situations. The Bayern Munich contigent in the side has had an exceptional domestic season and their form will be key to the side's chances of winning the cup. Expectation As always, Germany will go in the tournament as one of the favourites to lift the World Cup. Low's side have all the quality and depth and anything less than a semi-final finish could be seen as a major disappointment. Their major test though will come towards the end of the tournament and it will be interesting to see, whether they could cope with pressure.  PORTUGAL Profile Titles: None Top Scorer: Cristiano Ronaldo (49) Most Apearances: Luis Figo (127) FIFA Ranking: 4 Star Man: Cristiano Ronaldo Appearances: 110 Goals: 49 Formation 4-3-3   Coach Head coach Paulo Bento has now been a part of the camp for over four years and his quick counter attacking style has benefited the side in recent tournaments. He  has improved this side drastically from the one Carlos Queiroz had and although his side lack the quality the most major teams possess, Bento's Portugal could surprise a few. How they set up Bento's side is expeced to line up in their usual 4-3-3 formation with Helder Postiga being supported by Cristiano Ronaldo and Nani from the wings. The impressive form of William Carvalho this season could see him dethrone Raul Meireles as the defensive midfielder in the side whereas both Joao Moutinho and Miguel Veloso would provide the creative spark for the side. The major factor though will be whether Bento goes for an out and out striker in Postiga or shifts Ronaldo as the center forward. The side has hardly changed from the one that was put out in the Euro 2012 and the counter attacking style is expected to continue in Brazil as well. Key Players Ronaldo will once again be the star man in the Portuguese lineup. The Real Madrid man has had a blistering year playing a key role in the side's tenth European crown. The Real Madrid forward can provide goals, assits and is dangerous from set pieces. Alongside Ronaldo, Portugal's impressive midfield of Meireles, Moutinho will play a key role in assisting Cristiano in attack whereas in form Carvlaho will play a key role as the defensive midfielder in the side. Defensively the form of Pepe and Fabio Coentrao will come as a major boost for Bento and the camp. Strengths and Weaknesses Portugal's strength comes in their industrious midfield and their defensive solidarity. The likes of Bruno Alves, Fabio Coentrao and Pepe provide both defensive certainty as well as attacking threat from set pieces. Of course Ronaldo is their star player and his performances will determine how they shape up in attack. Portugal need to ensure they amalgamate around Ronaldo. Miguel Veloso, Moutinho provide creativity whereas Carvalho and Meireles will provide some much needed cover in their defensive third. Portugal's Achiles Heel has always been their striking department. A Selecao have not found the right man to lead them upfront for some time now and the idea of playing Ronaldo as a striker instead on the wings could backfire. The Real Madrid man has often been delpoyed as a number nine but has failed to flourish in the same manner as he has on the wings. The lack of game time for Manchester United winger Nani could be another issue for Bento in the tournament. The former Sporting manager needs to find the right partner for Ronaldo in attack and at present the options in hand don't look great. Expectation The Portuguese will be expected to progress from the group but it's hard to see them lasting long in the tournament. Anything over quarter-finals will be seen a good achievement  for Bento's side. GHANA Profile Titles: African Cup of Nations ( 1963, 1965, 1978, 1982) Top Scorer: Edward Acquah (40) Most Apearances: Asamoah Gyan (at present-77) FIFA Ranking: 38 Star Man: Asamoah Gyan Appearances: 77 Goals: 39 Formation 4-2-3-1   Coach Coach Kwesi Appiah becomes the only homegrown coach to lead Ghana into the World Cup finals. He is also among the two African coaches in this summers tournament. Appiah is no stranger to this side having led them as a caretaker manager before and was also the assistant manager when the side finished fourth in the African Cup of Nations back in 2013. The Ghanaian is known to provide free flowing attacking football and despite a demanding group, the  Black Stars are expected to continue their exciting brand of football. How they set up Ghana will lineup in their usual 4-2-3-1 formation, with the main focus being on their attack and the stern midfield they have at their disposal. The likes of Micheal Essien, Suley Muntari and Andrew Ayew provide quality as well as experience in the heart of the midfield, whereas Kevin Prince-Boateng will look to play a key role in the attack. Chelsea's youngster Christian Atsu could surprise a few with his skill and flair and can be one of the leading young prospects of the tournament. Appiah's use of 4-4-2 and often 4-5-1 gives them an alternative plan going into the game which could prove to be useful in defending against the likes of Portugal or Germany when needed.  Key Players Asamoah Gyan will look to put away the nightmare of the last World Cup behind him and lead the attack for the Africans. The former Sunderland striker has a knack for goals and his experience in the attack will come in handy. The likes of Essien, Boateng and Muntari will play a major role as well in providing balance to the side. Strengths and Weaknesses Ghana's strength lies in their experience. The likes of Essien, Muntari, Gyan, Boateng have all played for leading European clubs and have the experience of handling pressure situations. Appiah has done well to get the best out of this side on numerous occasions and their impressive qualifying campaign serves as an indication of that. Their major weakness though comes in the defense. As much as their front men look established and well settled, the same cannot be said about their rear guard. The full back position remains one of the major issue of the side as Samuel Inkoom has hardly done enough to warrant a place in the team whereas the center back position looks unsettled too as Appiah still does not know his best back four. Expectation Ghana could surprise a few in this summer's tournament. The squad is experienced and have players capable of producing inspirational moments when needed. They could possibly manage to surpass the group but anything more than that looks a distant dream. U.S.A Profile Titles: CONCACAF Gold Cup (1991, 2002, 2005, 2007, 2013) Top Scorer: Landon Donovan (57) Most Appearances: Cobi Jones (164) FIFA Ranking: 13 Star Man: Clint Dempsey Appearances: 104 Goals: 37 Formation 4-2-3-1   Coach The forer German international and coach, Jurgen Klinsmann will make his second appearance in the World Cup after leading the Germans to a semi-final finish in the 2006 World Cup. The former Bayern Munich manager has based his footballing philosophy on attack over the years and despite having a torrid start to life as US Men's National team coach (USMNT), the German has won over many hearts following their impressive performance in the CONACAF Championships last year. How they set up Klinsmann will look to set his side up in the usual 4-2-3-1 formation with Jozy Altidore leading the side from the front and Clint Dempsey providing the support right behind him. Michael Bradley will play the role of the anchorman in the midfield and will look to provide the key passes, as well as make those forward runs he is so used to. His partner Jermaine Jones is expected to cover up for him and do most of the dirty work in the side. Graham Zusi and Cobi Jones will make up the forward line in the attack alongside Dempsey and their pace and skills will come in handy. Damarcus Beasley's impressive form will see him continue as the left back despite being played as a midfielder for most part of his career, whereas impressive Matt Bresler will lead the defense. Jozy Altidore's strength makes him a good option to have upfront as it will allow him to hold the ball better thus allowing the rest to take part in the attack and providing more options for Klinsmann's men. Key Players One needs to look no further than the two most experienced players in the side in Tim Howard and Clint Dempsey as the star men. The duo have over 200 caps together and could play a key role in the side. Dempsey will have some added pressure on him considering the absence of Landon Donovan from the side this summer. Graham Zusi is another player who will garner much attention. The midfielder has been called up as a replacement for Donovan and a lot of eyes will be on him to deliver and live upto the expectations of his coach. Strengths and Weaknesses USA's major strength lies upfront with the likes of Zusi, Dempsey, Bradley all having a relatively decent seasons with their repective clubs. What will be worrying though is the form of striker Altidore who has had a torrid season for Sunderland this time around. The absence of Donovan though comes as the major blow for the side and could hurt them. Klinsmann might have taken a big step by omitting the star midfielder, but it is a gamble that could backfire. Beasley's impressive performances as a left back comes as a much needed boost for the side. The midfielder turned defender has done well for the national side over the years and could provide necessary cover for the defense. Expectation Not many will give the USMNT a chance to progress from this group. The CONCACAF Champions have a good squad but when pitted against the likes of Portugal and Ghana there is hardly any chance. A group stage exit looks likely. PREDICTION: 1. Germany 2. Portugal 3. Ghana 4. USA	sports

Brazil's World Cup hopes rest on the shoulders of Neymar - Goal.com	The Brazilian is arguably the best player in the Selecao squad and and his form could play a key role in their quest to land the World Cup after 12 long years... COMMENT By Shikharr Chandra On Monday morning, just two days before the opening game of the World Cup Neymar went down holding his ankle at the Teresopolis training ground in front of more than a thousand Brazil fans. There was a sense of anxiety among the supporters who saw their talisman down injured. A few minutes later, the Barcelona forward stood up and placed the ball to practice his free kicks. Neymar curled in three back-to-back free kicks right in the top corner with five men in the wall plus the goal-keeper who were left out as mere spectators. Service was restored in the Brazil camp. Neymar is without doubt the most influential player in this Brazil squad. A player on whom rests the hopes of not only the entire nation but also the millions of Brazil supporters all over the world. The portraits of the former Santos star can be found painted on the streets of Kolkata as well. A flag with 'We don’t score with our hand' printed on it shows the loyalty the city has for the Brazilians and the expectations they have from the 'Prince' of the Selecao. For few years now, Neymar has been the rising star of this Brazil squad. The potential was always there, it was just the matter of how ready the 22-year old was to dawn the famous yellow jersey of Brazil. South American Footballer of the year at the age of 19, Neymar followed it with a Ballon D'Or nomination as well as landing the Puskas award the same year. He had announced himself to the world at such a tender age. Handed over the famous number 10 jersey for Brazil, previously dawned by the likes of Pele and Zico, in him the fans saw their messiah and the team-mates saw a player they could rely on during times of adversity. This was pretty evident with his performances first in the South American Youth Championships, then at the Olympics and later at the Confederations Cup, where he was handed the Golden Ball award for his impressive performances throughout the tournament. While the trust and the confidence bestowed by the fans has been incredible, there is a sense of fret amongst the supporters as well, as to whether their 'Prince' can live upto all the hype that has surrounded him this time around or will he succumb to pressure as many believe he has after his first season at Nou Camp. Neymar's Barcelona journey hasn't gone as planned, both on as well as off the field. The controversy surrounding his transfer usurped the likes of Barcelona president Sandro Rosell and eventually led to a trophyless season with manager Tata Martino being sacked. While many blame it on him not getting his desired role at the club due to the presence of a certain Lionel Messi in the squad, some believe the over the top expectations in his very first season in Europe led to the 'disappointment'. But judging him based on his Barcelona career is rather harsh. For a player born and bred in the South American style of football, it was never going to be easy settling into the European life. In addition to this, the psychological pressure of living up to the transfer fee that still remains one of the biggest mystery of last season. Add to this the constant comparison with Real Madrid's Gareth Bale certainly took a toll on him. His on-field antics did not help his case as well. From 28 starts for Barcelona, Neymar has scored 15 goals and provided 11 assists in all competitions. Flop? Definitely not. Especially when you consider him playing second fiddle to Messi for the majority of the season. At Brazil though, things are different. Luiz Felipe Scolari has based his entire setup to get the best out of his star player. From being deployed on the left flank, Neymar has been given the license to roam around and get as much of the ball as he can. Even striker Fred's duty is too hold the ball and involve the Barcelona forward as much as possible. Scolari knows the potential of Neymar and what he is capable of. When at his best, Neymar is an enticing player, probably on the same level as Cristiano Ronaldo or Messi. Neymar is at his exclusive best when donning the yellow jersey. His dribbling coupled with blistering pace make him a player worth watching on field. He makes things look so simple. The video of him stepping upto take the penalty kick during training and suddenly hitting it with the other leg caught the attention of millions on YouTube. Neymar's skills are not just limited to off-field show boating, on the field as well he has sparkled with the ball on his feet, blazing past defenders and often leaving them for dead. While his upper body strength remains in question as to whether he can handle the persistent fouls that come his way during the tournament, there is little doubt about his mental strength given that he has grown up with challenges in front of him and has consistently delivered on high expectations. The sun shone on Neymar during their game against Panama, and the entire nation will be hoping the sun shines on their wonder boy as he steps out at Sao Paolo tonight. A city that has seen so many struggles and protests lately because of the World Cup, needs its posterboy to step up and provide the trophy they are so obsessed with	sports

Add to this the constant comparison with Real Madrid's Gareth Bale certainly took a toll on him. His on-field antics did not help his case as well. From 28 starts for Barcelona, Neymar has scored 15 goals and provided 11 assists in all competitions. Flop? Definitely not. Especially when you consider him playing second fiddle to Messi for the majority of the season. At Brazil though, things are different. Luiz Felipe Scolari has based his entire setup to get the best out of his star player. From being deployed on the left flank, Neymar has been given the license to roam around and get as much of the ball as he can. Even striker Fred's duty is too hold the ball and involve the Barcelona forward as much as possible. Scolari knows the potential of Neymar and what he is capable of. When at his best, Neymar is an enticing player, probably on the same level as Cristiano Ronaldo or Messi. Neymar is at his exclusive best when donning the yellow jersey. His dribbling coupled with blistering pace make him a player worth watching on field. He makes things look so simple. The video of him stepping upto take the penalty kick during training and suddenly hitting it with the other leg caught the attention of millions on YouTube. Neymar's skills are not just limited to off-field show boating, on the field as well he has sparkled with the ball on his feet, blazing past defenders and often leaving them for dead. While his upper body strength remains in question as to whether he can handle the persistent fouls that come his way during the tournament, there is little doubt about his mental strength given that he has grown up with challenges in front of him and has consistently delivered on high expectations. The sun shone on Neymar during their game against Panama, and the entire nation will be hoping the sun shines on their wonder boy as he steps out at Sao Paolo tonight. A city that has seen so many struggles and protests lately because of the World Cup, needs its posterboy to step up and provide the trophy they are so obsessed with	sports

Karim Bencherifa: I want to win a trophy for Pune FC - Goal.com	The former Mariners coach explains that he is an ardent admirer of his new club's professionalism, hopes to establish an I-League winning team... Karim Bencharifa has stated that he hopes to put the experience he has gained from an ill-fated second reign at Mohun Bagan, to ensure that Pune FC are the ones who gain the most through his mentoring.   Speaking to Goal, Bencherifa was asked to shed light on his stint at Mohun Bagan, which saw the Kolkata stalwarts finish a lowly eighth last season. “It was challenging and difficult but it was another learning experience which will be useful for my coaching carrier. "There were ups and downs, but I was hoping to do much better. For different reasons, it didn't happen. One of my biggest satisfactions is the discovery of some exciting new talents, which is almost impossible to do with the big Kolkata clubs due to the pressure on players and coaches.” Pressurized to describe the intricacies that led to his team’s poor form, Bencherifa chose to be non-committal. “Without going through the details when a team doesn't do well, the coach must take responsibility for that. So one of the reasons is myself but there other reasons which I don't want to elaborate and anyway I am a person who looks forward rather than complaining about the past. Overall there were many good moments and I will remember only this.” Having plied his trade in Goa and Kolkata only, Benncherifa's next job is in a city which isn't traditionally known to be a football hob. “I have no problem with that though I do feel that Pune have many people who know and follow the game. It is up to us to bring them to the stadium and get them interested more in the team, the key is our performances. We, including the players and the staff, have to create a dynamic around the club; play well, win games, be consistent and that's the key,” elucidated Bencherifa, who acknowledged the task at hand. Questioned on his target with the Red Lizards, he expressed hopefulness by stating that he would want to win a trophy with the club who haven't yet laid their hands on silverware. “I wish to help the club get the first silverware. Though Pune FC hasn’t won any trophy yet I think they did a lot for Indian football and the I-League. They brought a lot of professionalism and fresh ideas on how to run a club. "They are a model in youth development and this will definitely work for the benefit of the club in the near future. So I am very hopeful about the outcome of the next season or two.” “Well despite that, I think over the years Pune FC always managed to build quite a strong, competitive team and we will try to do the same this year. The base and core of the team is there already, with some quality youngsters pushing their way to the first team." Pune FC are known not to splurge in the transfer market unlike some of the biggest Kolkata clubs. Bencherifa isn't concerned as he believes a pragmatic approach to finance is always a good option. "There is nothing wrong when a club spends wisely and that’s what usually happens here,” replied Bencherifa. Finally the Moroccan aired his views on a long standing belief, that Pune FC were the most professional team in the country. “As I’ve said before, Pune FC leads the way when it comes to professionalism, from the way they handle and take care of the first team, the organisation of the I-League matches, the setup of the youth development etc. "I am sure there will be much more to come. That’s one of the reasons I am excited to be associated with this club,” concluded Bencherifa, who no doubt wishes to weave an I-League winning campaign at his latest club.  	sports

2014 World Cup Brazil: A Primer - Goal.com	Goal takes time out to deconstruct the facts of the World Cup before it finally gets underway... The greatest tournament on earth is about to get underway in the football capital of the world in Brazil and Goal lays out the basic must know facts for anyone and everyone who wishes to survive for the next month and a half without appearing completely out of the loop.  What is the World Cup?    When the need for an international football competition arose especially after the tremendous popularity of the sport, an amateur competition in the Olympics wasn't enough and a professional pan world competition was the order of the day leading to the 1930 'World Cup' in Uruguay which had seven nations from South America, four from Europe and two from North America with the host nation being victorious, in the inaugural competition. Who organises it? The first global football competition in the Olympics with only amateurs was organised by the FA (Football Association) of Britain. Then came the existence of FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association), a body found in Switzerland by the football associations of Belgium, France, Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden and Germany for organising the game globally. Britain soon became a member and it was in 1950 Brazil that England finally participated in the World Cup which was again won by Uruguay. How many teams participate in the 'World Cup'? Originally it was limited to 16 nations till 1978 and expanded to 24 teams in 1982 and finally to its present number of 32 since 1986. Recently it was proposed by UEFA president Michel Platini, that the World Cup could be extended to 40 nations. "The World Cup is] not based on the quality of the teams because you don't have the best 32 at the World Cup, but it's a good compromise. It's a political matter so why not have more Africans? The competition is to bring all the people of all the world. If you don't give the possibility to participate, they don't improve."  Can we really call it the World Cup?  Not really but it certainly comes close in spite of the domination of the European and South American nations. In the soon to kickoff 2014 World Cup, 13 nations are from Europe, 6 from South America, 4 from North America, 5 from Africa and 4 from Asia. If you were to take the 32 best teams in the world, this would certainly not be it, but this certainly comes close in accordance of FIFA distributing berths regionally. Who is the official mascot of the FIFA World Cup? In keeping with the World Cup tradition of having a mascot, this time it's the turn of a three-banded Brazilian Armaddillo, a species native to Brazil and placed in the UN Red list amongst those vulnerable. Fuleco was the name chosen by fans which is a combination of the words football and ecology. The lively character can be found wearing a white T-shirt with the words 'Brasil 2014'.  Where will the World Cup be played? With the rotatory policy of FIFA, it was the turn of South America to host the 'Cup of Joy' and only Colombia and Brazil were the interested parties. However later with Colombia pulling out, Brazil were the only choice. Twelve venues in Brazil have been selected to host the grand competition with seven brand new and five renovated stadiums. These included popular spots like Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and Brasilia to relatively desolate spots like Manaus, which have no local football team.  What is the reason for all the protests if Brazil is such a football crazy nation? We might think that a zealous football loving nation like Brazil would be overjoyed to host the sport they love. Of course they are, but the ground realities are very harsh. With the nation in an impoverished condition, the people are not taking it too kindly as the Brasil government has bowed down to all the demands of FIFA including tax exemption to the tune of more than 270 million dollars. A Brazil public safety law which prohibited alcohol consumption in stadiums too was turned down because one of the alcohol beverage company was one of the official sponsors of the World Cup. When can I watch the World Cup?  For us in India, the World Cup starts like everyone else from tomorrow. But, with the drastically different time zones, the games will unfortunately be telecasted from midnight to dawn, with kickoffs at 12.30 AM, 1.30 AM, 3.30 AM and 6.30 AM. For the people who cannot stay awake even for this, breathe easy -as there are indeed a couple of matches at primetime which is 9.30 PM. For the complete TV Guide to the World Cup look here.  Why does the World Cup have an official ball?  Since 1970 Adidas has been an official sponsor for FIFA in World Cups and part of this is they get to name the official match ball in the Cup. For the last World Cup, it was christened Jabulani and this time it is Brazuca, the first ball to have its name was chosen by the fans. An interesting fact with regards to the Brazuca, is that the ball was manufactured close to home, by Forward Sports in Sialkot, Pakistan. 	sports

Messi fooled by Ronaldinho lookalike - Goal.com	The Argentina attacker was met by a pitch invader he momentarily took for his former Barcelona team-mate in the Albiceleste's training session on Wednesday By Ben Hayward in Belo Horizonte Lionel Messi was taken by surprise during  Argentina's training session on Wednesday by a pitch invader he briefly mistook for his former Barcelona team-mate and friend Ronaldinho. Argentina trained in front of thousands of fans and press at Belo Horizonte's Estadio Independencia, where Ronaldinho regularly turns out for Atletico Mineiro. After some light running, the Albiceleste squad were divided into small groups for games of football-tennis in a low-key session which finished amid chaos as over a dozen supporters climbed over the fences to invade the pitch and ran in search of a handshake or a hug from their heroes. Most headed in Messi's direction and security guards were overwhelmed in their attempts to halt the fans as the practice was quickly brought to an abrupt end. But the Argentine was initially fooled by the Ronaldinho double. Robinson Oliveira, who works as a professional lookalike of the Brazilian forward, told Goal: "When he saw me he was shocked because he thought I was the real Ronaldinho and he told me that I didn't need to run on the pitch to see him. "He said: 'What are you doing running on here to see me?' When he held my hand, I went down on my knees [and bowed]. It was so emotional." He added: "I didn't plan this. I just thought to myself that I have to hold his hand because this is the only opportunity I will have to see him." The lookalike, who bears an uncanny resemblance to the former Barca hero, ended up with a bloodied hand after scaling the fence in his adventure to meet Messi, but said: "It was worth it." Asked which of the two players he prefers, he replied: "Ronaldinho, of course!" Argentina and Messi kick off their World Cup campaign against Bosnia at the Maracana on Sunday.	sports

'My mission isn't finished' - Blatter to stand for re-election - Goal.com	Despite severe criticism from high-profile figures in football and calls for him to stand down, the leader of world football's governing body says he will stand for election again Sepp Blatter will stand for re-election as Fifa president after the organisation voted against term and age limits for officials. The 78-year-old's widely anticipated announcement that he is to pursue a fifth term in office comes amid a tumultuous week personally in the build-up to the World Cup in Brazil. Blatter branded UK newspaper reports of fresh corruption allegations relating to the voting process for the hosting of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar as racist, bringing sustained criticism from leading figures in Uefa and across European football. Yet, despite this groundswell of continental ill-feeling against Blatter, the vote at the Fifa Congress to reject limits on the age of officials and the lengths of term they can serve demonstrated the widespread support he retains across world football's governing body. Welcomed to the stage with applause as he made his closing remarks in Sao Paulo, Blatter said: "I know that my mandate will finish next year on 29 May in Zurich. But my mission is not finished. "And I tell you together we will build the new Fifa together. We have the foundations today because we have the budget for the next four years. "We have the foundation, now we work. Congress, you will decide who takes this great institution forward. "But I can tell you I am ready to accompany you in the future." Jerome Champagne, whose confirmed candidacy for the Fifa presidency in 2015 has won high-profile support in the form of Pele, made a prompt statement in response to Blatter's announcement. It read: "For the past years and in particular since I declared my candidacy on January 20, 2014 in London, I have been defending the need of a genuine, respectful and fair-play debate on all issues affecting Fifa and football in the 21st century. "Moreover, in any democratic organisation, the election of its president is about vision, programmes and manifestos. No one should fear this open discussion in front of the people of football, which would honour those organising and conducting it." Blatter, meanwhile, also suggested football could follow in the footsteps of cricket by allowing managers two challenges to officials' decisions per game by reviewing instant television replays of contentious incidents - a major departure from his previous caution over introducing greater technology into football. "We could do something more on the field of play," Blatter said. "Why don't we give team managers the possibility of two challenges for refereeing during the match? If the manager disagrees with a decision why should he not ask for an immediate TV review with the referee?" Blatter did sound a far less polarising tone earlier in the day when he called for stronger action to be taken to curb racism in world football. He said: "We must impose the toughest punishment to send a clear message. Suspension and empty stadia is not enough. As coming out of the resoution of last year, we should be docking points, expelling teams, or relegating them. This would be an example for all the others."	sports

'We know how to stop Brazil' - Kovac - Goal.com	The Eastern Europeans meet the tournament hosts to kick off the tournament and the coach is adamant his side can get something from the game Croatia coach Niko Kovac says his team know what they have to do to stop Brazil and Neymar when they meet in the opening match of the World Cup. The two sides kick off the tournament on Thursday at the Corinthians Arena with Brazil the favourites to win the match and the competition outright. But Kovac insists it will be no easy task for Luiz Felipe Scolari's men and says his team are capable of handling them. "We know how to stop Neymar and Brazil," Kovac said at his press conference. "Brazil is not only Neymar - they have a great team, but Croatia also have excellent players. "All those in the team know how nice it is to play for Croatia and how much we love our people. We will leave our heart on the field." The teams last met in the 2006 World Cup in Germany, with Brazil winning 1-0, but Kovac says his side will fight for a good result against the five-time world champions and vowed to attack throughout the game. The coach continued: "In Berlin, we were not able to surprise them, but we will give our best. No surrender - we will attack Brazil! Just as we did in the Serbia friendly. Possession is very important because Brazilians do not like to run for the ball." Croatia captain Dario Srna also vowed to make it difficult for the South American hosts, insisting they will make their fans proud of them. "I cannot promise that we'll go get a group win or beat Brazil, but we'll give every ounce of energy," he said. " It is a big day for us.  All Croatians will be proud.  "The pitch is great and our preparation went great, the conditions in the camp are excellent, arriving in Sao Paulo went without problems.  "Fernandinho and Willian are my friends. We agree that Brazil is the favourite, but they will not find it easy."	sports

'We know how to stop Brazil' - Kovac - Goal.com	The Eastern Europeans meet the tournament hosts to kick off the tournament and the coach is adamant his side can get something from the game Croatia coach Niko Kovac says his team know what they have to do to stop Brazil and Neymar when they meet in the opening match of the World Cup.

'My mission isn't finished' - Blatter to stand for re-election - Goal.com	Despite severe criticism from high-profile figures in football and calls for him to stand down, the leader of world football's governing body says he will stand for election again Sepp Blatter will stand for re-election as Fifa president after the organisation voted against term and age limits for officials. The 78-year-old's widely anticipated announcement that he is to pursue a fifth term in office comes amid a tumultuous week personally in the build-up to the World Cup in Brazil. Blatter branded UK newspaper reports of fresh corruption allegations relating to the voting process for the hosting of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar as racist, bringing sustained criticism from leading figures in Uefa and across European football. Yet, despite this groundswell of continental ill-feeling against Blatter, the vote at the Fifa Congress to reject limits on the age of officials and the lengths of term they can serve demonstrated the widespread support he retains across world football's governing body. Welcomed to the stage with applause as he made his closing remarks in Sao Paulo, Blatter said: "I know that my mandate will finish next year on 29 May in Zurich. But my mission is not finished. "And I tell you together we will build the new Fifa together. We have the foundations today because we have the budget for the next four years. "We have the foundation, now we work. Congress, you will decide who takes this great institution forward. "But I can tell you I am ready to accompany you in the future." Jerome Champagne, whose confirmed candidacy for the Fifa presidency in 2015 has won high-profile support in the form of Pele, made a prompt statement in response to Blatter's announcement. It read: "For the past years and in particular since I declared my candidacy on January 20, 2014 in London, I have been defending the need of a genuine, respectful and fair-play debate on all issues affecting Fifa and football in the 21st century. "Moreover, in any democratic organisation, the election of its president is about vision, programmes and manifestos. No one should fear this open discussion in front of the people of football, which would honour those organising and conducting it." Blatter, meanwhile, also suggested football could follow in the footsteps of cricket by allowing managers two challenges to officials' decisions per game by reviewing instant television replays of contentious incidents - a major departure from his previous caution over introducing greater technology into football. "We could do something more on the field of play," Blatter said. "Why don't we give team managers the possibility of two challenges for refereeing during the match? If the manager disagrees with a decision why should he not ask for an immediate TV review with the referee?" Blatter did sound a far less polarising tone earlier in the day when he called for stronger action to be taken to curb racism in world football. He said: "We must impose the toughest punishment to send a clear message. Suspension and empty stadia is not enough. As coming out of the resoution of last year, we should be docking points, expelling teams, or relegating them. This would be an example for all the others."	sports
Van Persie, Robben and Sneijder are a real threat, admits Martinez - Goal.com	The Spain international admits his side have to be wary of the Dutch trio and says they are desperate to win their opening game of the tournament Spain midfielder Javi Martinez has highlighted Netherlands attackers Robin van Persie, Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder as a real threat to his side's chances in their World Cup opener on Friday. The two teams meet in a replay of the 2010 final, in which an Andres Iniesta goal in extra time clinched the trophy for the Spaniards after Arjen Robben had missed a glorious opportunity on the hour mark. And Martinez believes the reigning European and world champions will have to be wary of his Bayern team-mate along with Van Persie and Sneijder in the re-match. "Their biggest threat are their front three, who are all world class," he told reporters. "Robben is excellent at drifting into space and we will have to watch out for that." The 25-year-old says he has spoken to Robben about that missed chance four years ago. Martinez continued: "We have talked about it in the past couple of years. It was a bitter blow for Holland and him personally. "We've spoken about that match and the one-on-ones against Iker a fair few times. Before the 2013 Champions League final I told him not to blow his opportunity to make amends and he didn't." Martinez believes there is extra pressure on Spain to win their opening game in such a tight group which also consists of Chile and Australia. "After losing our first game last time round, the onus is on us not to do the same thing again," he said. "We showed that it isn't the be-all and end-all in South Africa, but getting off to a good start gives you extra confidence, even though we ended up as champions four years ago." The former Athletic Bilbao player also reflected on last year's Confederations Cup defeat to Brazil, the tournament hosts who are rated as favourites to win this year's tournament. "Brazil were more aggressive than us," conceded Martinez. "We were outclassed and it was a wake-up call. If we're not up for every match, anyone can beat us."	sports

Chelsea boss Mourinho rules out Hazard exit - Goal.com	The Portuguese has no intention of letting the Belgian leave west London despite claiming that he was "not ready to sacrifice himself 100 per cent for the team" last term Jose Mourinho has dismissed speculation surrounding Eden Hazard's future, declaring that the Belgian will not be allowed to leave Chelsea this summer. The 23-year-old had been heavily linked with French champions Paris Saint-Germain, with Laurent Blanc publicly expressing interest in the attacker, though Hazard has since said he is certain to remain in London. And Mourinho, despite having been critical of Hazard during last season's Premier League run-in, has now confirmed that he has no intention of letting the former Lille man leave Stamford Bridge. "Just because I say that Eden does not have everything, it doesn't mean I don't want him," the Portuguese told L'Equipe. "He has fantastic potential and will express it at Chelsea. For him, as for others, the door is closed. People who know me know that, when I say that, I mean it." Hazard was Chelsea's top scorer in the Premier League last season, netting 14 times, while he also made seven assists. Though the west Londoners have already sold David Luiz to PSG, as well as releasing Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole, Hazard is highly unlikely to join them in leaving Chelsea and is in the process of sealing a contract extension. "I am staying at Chelsea, [that is] 100 per cent sure," he told Le Derniere Heure on Monday. "I am in discussions with Chelsea for a new contract. "It is only the beginning of the talks right now so we have got time but the fact that Chelsea have offered me a new deal means that they have got a lot of confidence in me that I can do a good job and that they can count on me."	sports

Pirlo: Italy must be careful against improving England - Goal.com	The veteran Juventus midfielder says that the Azzurri "know how to face" Saturday's Group D opponents, though he urges caution against the Three Lions' young, fast starlets Italy midfielder Andrea Pirlo has warned his team-mates that they can expect to face a different and much-improved England side than the one whom they sent crashing out of Euro 2012. The two sides meet in Manaus on Saturday in their opening game of the World Cup, a repeat of their quarter-final clash two years ago in Kiev, in which the Azzurri progressed after a penalty shootout. But Pirlo is not taking the Three Lions' threat lightly, highlighting the emergence of youth within England's ranks, though he is confident that Cesare Prandelli's men are capable of coming out on top. "We know England are a good team that has improved a lot," he told reporters. "They have new, young players, who are fast. We will have to be careful. "However, we know how to face them. Italy have always played great games against England and hence we will have our chances." Pirlo was instrumental in Italy's victory over England in Ukraine, famously completing more passes than Roy Hodgson's entire midfield combined, but he insists that the four-time World Cup winners are more than a one-man team. "This national team is not Pirlo-dependent," the 35-year-old argued. "In order to go all the way you need everyone's contribution. "Our aim should be to win and go until the end. We have a very competitive team and we will give our all to win this tournament. I never compete to take part but to finish first."	sports

I want to replicate PSG success with Milan - Menez - Goal.com	The France international says Pippo Inzaghi's outfit have the ability in their squad to challenge at the top again following a difficult 2013-14 campaign Jeremy Menez says he wants to have the same success with AC Milan that he enjoyed with Paris Saint-Germain. The France international joined PSG from Roma in 2011 and has since won two consecutive Ligue 1 titles and reached the Champions League quarter-finals in each of the last two seasons. The 27-year-old attacker arrived in Italy on Wednesday to undergo a medical ahead of his proposed move to the San Siro giants, and told reporters he is keen to repeat his experiences in the French capital upon donning the Milan shirt. "I'm very happy, I want to win with this shirt as I did with PSG," he admitted after landing in Lombardy. "Why Milan? Because it's a big team, not just a big club. I really hope to do well." Menez returns to Italy to become new coach Filippo Inzaghi's first signing as the club attempt to put a disappointing 2013-14 campaign behind them. But having previously spent three years with Roma before his transfer to Paris three years ago, he insists that he will show on the field of play just how his game has progressed since his last spell in Serie A. "Differences between this Menez and the old one? You will see on the pitch. Compared to four years ago, I have grown a lot and I want to prove it on the field." Menez spent Wednesday evening dining with Milan CEO Adriano Galliani and will undergo a medical at the club's Milanello complex on Thursday ahead of signing a €4.5 million-a-year, three-year deal.	sports

England can't handle the World Cup pressure, says Vialli - Goal.com	The former Chelsea player and manager feels that the Three Lions have a habit of crumbling at major tournaments, though he acknowledges that they could pose Italy problems Gianluca Vialli believes Italy will handle the pressure of the World Cup better than Group D rivals England. The 49-year-old, who was at Chelsea for four years before later managing Watford, thinks that players who do well in the Premier League find it hard to cope with the expectation at major international tournaments. With the Azzurri first up for the Three Lions in Manaus on Saturday, Vialli is confident that his nation will be in better shape, claiming that they "eat pressure for breakfast". He told Perform: "I think it's quite funny with England because, for about four years, all the England fans and the England players feel a bit depressed and disillusioned when it comes to the England side and then, one month before the World Cup starts, everybody sort of starts feeling that they [will] naturally win it and everybody feels super-confident. "I think that England fans should try to find a balance in between both state of minds but I think the England players find it quite difficult when they play in the World Cup because they are not used to the pressure. "When they play in the Premiership, when they play Manchester United versus Chelsea, for example, or Arsenal, there's no pressure; it's actually quite fun to play. "You know that there are no consequences if you don't do well, as long as you do your best on the pitch, and therefore, when they play for the national team, when they wear the England shirt, all of a sudden they realise they are representing their country. They feel there is a massive expectation, there's a lot of scrutiny and a lot of consequences. "It's the inability to handle the pressure that makes a big difference between between the Italian players and the England players when it comes to the World Cup stage. "The Italian players, they eat pressure for breakfast so they grow up with a lot of pressure and they know how to handle it. "Also [Italy] are very good at winning games even though we are not playing at our best, which is something that England players need to learn quite fast if they want to succeed in the World Cup because there will be one or two games where you will not be performing so you need to be able to win it anyway. Historically we are very good at that." Although Vialli is not convinced by England's ability to perform under intense pressure, he acknowledges that they are more than capable of posing a threat on Saturday. "I think England are a very exciting side because they have got so many young, talented, creative players playing up front," he added. "The likes of [Daniel] Sturridge, [Wayne] Rooney, and [Raheem] Sterling, [Adam] Lallana, [Danny] Welbeck, they can turn hot quickly and can create problems for the opposition. "They need to be a bit more clinical, though, because there won't be many goalscoring opportunities so they need to take their chances when they can."	sports

Beating Brazil in the final would be like an orgasm, says Maradona - Goal.com	The 53-year-old says he would love to see his country beat their South American rivals in the final and told Pele to go 'back to the museum' Argentina legend Diego Maradona claims that beating hosts and bitter rivals Brazil in the World Cup final would be "like an orgasm". Maradona, who famously helped guide his country to World Cup glory in 1986, believes Alejandro Sabella's men should be aiming to at least reach the final at Maracana on July 13.  Both Argentina and Brazil are among the tournament favourites, but Sabella's side will first have to escape Group F, which also contains debutants Bosnia-Herzegovina, Iran and Nigeria. If Argentina were to reach the final and subsequently pip five-time world champions Brazil to the title, Maradona has no doubts that it would be the perfect victory. The 53-year-old told Diario Ole: "Hopefully they can do it [reach the final]. The target will be to reach that point. "There, Argentina can open up against Brazil, who will surely be in the final. To beat Brazil in the final would be like an orgasm." The former Barcelona and Napoli star also continued his long-standing feud with Brazil legend Pele before dismissing comparisons between Neymar and Lionel Messi. "How have I been received in Brazil? Better than Pele, although that is not saying much," he continued. "You can tell Pele to go back to the museum. It's clear that the distance between Messi and Neymar is the same between Maradona and Pele. "Neymar is today's Pele. In Brazil he is bigger, everyone is looking to him as the great figure of Brazilian football." Maradona also believes Messi will be able to hit his best form for Argentina this year, something he hasn't done at a major international tournament as of yet. "If an individual inspires the team with his brilliance, it helps immensely," he wrote in Times of India. "That is why I believe the presence of Messi and Ronaldo will help Argentina and Portugal play better. "These two are the best of this generation and both are yet to play at the best of their abilities in the biggest tournament."	sports

Italy playmaker Andrea Pirlo confident ahead of England World Cup 2014 clash - Telegraph	It is little wonder, then, that there is talk of Hodgson specifically adapting his formation to deal with the unique threat of a playmaker who operates so far behind the main striker. Pirlo is confident that the Italian midfield will simply use their movement to ensure that any man-marking strategy would be doomed to failure. Italy tested out a 4-1-3-1-1 formation during their training session on Wednesday and have been constantly tweaking their system during the build-up matches. Daniele De Rossi and Marco Verratti are expected to start but the one certainty is that manager Cesare Prandelli will give Pirlo the freedom to influence the game however he sees fit. “We tried this new solution with a midfielder in front of the defence and two further forward with more freedom,” said Pirlo. “We aim to rotate the midfield positions to keep our opponents guessing. "We like this option, it can give great results and we are working to improve every day. We can try many different approaches but it is also down to how you interpret the role. In truth it’s a system that involves rotation, as we go forward and at other times I’d come back into the more classic position.” Italy’s form in the warm-up matches will have prompted few alarm bells with England. True, they found their goalscoring touch in dispatching Fluminense 5-3 on Sunday but were winless in six previously during a sequence that even included an embarrassing 1-1 draw with Luxembourg. Pirlo was part of the Italy team that won the 2006 World Cup and he is still adamant that a repeat is possible. He also dismissed questions about his own elite status and the suggestion that Italy had become dependent upon him. “I was never interested in being a world star,” he said. “I think about enjoying - you journalists make the world stars. No. We are 23 players at the disposal of the coach and know to go all the way we need a contribution from everyone, as we learned in 2006. “Can Italy win the World Cup? Of course. When I play, it is solely to win. I am never just content with getting through the round. We have a competitive squad and will give our all to achieve this objective. We have the chance to make this a World Cup to be remembered for all our lives. We have what it takes to go far. The important thing is to believe, sacrifice ourselves, work hard and the results can arrive.” That process begins on Saturday, with Pirlo hinting that he could yet renege on a previous plan to retire from international football after this World Cup. At 35, his hunger to keep playing in club football was underlined on Wednesday by confirmation of a new two-year contract at Juventus. “I intend to quit international football after this World Cup but if I am needed...” said Pirlo. “I am still thinking of retiring, as I have a certain age and it’s only right to leave the field to the next generation coming through. It would be pointless to continue. “If I am needed, then there’s no problem in coming back. But if I come on international duty and don’t play, then I’d get angry. So it’s perhaps better I stay home.” It was a mercurial answer but typical of the one player who adds fantasy to an Italy team that still lack a certain flair. In his recent autobiography, Pirlo made a point of acknowledging how Juninho Pernambucano had inspired his free-kick technique and the former Brazil midfielder was even a guest on Wednesday at Casa Azzurri. “Pirlo is a demon, he not only copied my shot but improved it - if I was still playing I’d ask him to teach me,” said Juninho. Pirlo digested the compliment, gratefully accepted a Brazil shirt with his name on it and then delivered an even better sound-bite of his own. “Juninho was very kind to me, we were both emotional,” he said. “I’m Italian, but I’m also part Brazilian - Pirlinho, if you like.”	sports
Neymar: I had a Ronaldo haircut in 2002 - Goal.com	Il Fenomeno made headlines for his appearance as much as his on-field heroics in Japan and South Korea, but the Barcelona star admits he mimicked the look of his idol By Kris Voakes in Sao Paulo Neymar has revealed he sported the same outrageous hairstyle as Ronaldo during Brazil's triumphant 2002 World Cup campaign. Ronaldo notched eight goals - including two in the final against Germany - to finish clear at the top of the scoring charts in Japan and South Korea, but made as many headlines for his appearance as his on-field heroics. The former Real Madrid striker shaved off all his hair except a section at the front, with the look since regularly topping lists of the worst haircuts in football history. But Neymar admits his admiration for Il Fenomeno prompted him to follow suit during the tournament, even though he claims he has forgotten most of the context of Brazil's fifth World Cup victory. "In 2002, I had a haircut like Ronaldo's but I don't remember much," he told reporters at a press conference in Sao Paulo ahead of Thursday's tournament opener against Croatia. "I remember celebrating. "Romario and Ronaldo are the two star players that I always think of when we talk about World Cups, especially 2002. "I get inspiration from all players all over the world, players like Messi and Ronaldo, but I hope to follow my path together with my team."	sports

Wayne Rooney says he has no excuses with England at World Cup 2014 - Telegraph	“Maybe you guys, the media, have put me under a lot of pressure and I’ve tried to respond to that. This time I haven’t and I’m not going to. I’m going to enjoy it. I’m excited for this tournament. I’m enjoying working with the younger lads and the experienced lads. I really believe we can do well. “I’ve learnt to enjoy this one because I haven’t enjoyed the last ones, they’ve not gone well. All of a sudden you’re looking back and they’ve gone and I didn’t enjoy it. I’m going to make sure I take positive memories from this one. I hope so. I know the last tournaments haven’t gone well for me and, if this one doesn’t, I’ll have no excuses. I’ve prepared well for it.’’ Rooney is certainly better prepared than at the 2010 World Cup when he railed against England fans in Cape Town after their dissent towards a dreadful display against Algeria. “I regret that. It was the heat of the moment and it happened, and you move on. Listen, I’ll do my best for England and I’m sure the fans see that. All fans have favourite players. I’m sure the English Man United fans like me! It was stupid of me but it was a frustrating time. “The hardest thing about last time was I missed my family, and this time I’ve learnt to deal with that. Of course I miss them. They’ll be over here eventually. Not with me but they will be. To be honest, it’s good to get a few days’ rest!” Rooney has two sons, aged four and one, and the elder is beginning to note the focus on his father. “For instance, towards the end of last season, when I walked out at Old Trafford the fans were shouting and he was asking why. He’s not a massive football fan. He’s not really into it at the minute. He’s still young. I’m sure, in time, it’ll come.” As well as the maturing effects of fatherhood, Rooney’s equanimity has been helped by talking to the sports psychologist, Dr Steve Peters, who is travelling with England. “I’ve spoken to him a few times. He’s a great benefit for the team. I found him great and easy to talk to.’’ The tournament he enjoyed most was Euro 2004 when he was a teenager, playing without fear, just loving the occasion. “I did enjoy that one. I was doing well. That’s the good thing about the younger lads in the squad, like Ross [Barkley] and Raheem (Sterling). You can see that there’s no fear with them. They’ll be good players, big players for us.” He will tell them to “enjoy it”, adding “You have to enjoy the moment”. Against Ecuador in the Miami friendly, when the focus was on him after injury and some travails in front of goal, Rooney celebrated wildly scoring from three yards. “One yard! I know this is a big tournament for me which I want to do well in, so I was delighted to score. If you look at my record in us qualifying for this World Cup, I had a pretty good record. I hadn’t done too well in the friendlies, but when it counted in the qualifiers, it happened. That’s what I have to do again in this tournament.’’ He is currently on 39 goals, 10 short of Sir Bobby Charlton’s England record which he wants to beat. “It would be great,’’ said the 28-year-old. “At my age, I should break that record. I just want to keep playing, keep trying to score. If I can get Sir Bobby’s record it would be a massive achievement. I’d be absolutely delighted. I want to score goals and help England be successful. If I play well, the team will play well. I feel better than I have done for years. I’m ready for this tournament.’’ He did not particularly appreciate the critical comments from his former team-mate, Paul Scholes, about his having peaked as a player. “I don’t agree with it. I’m sure he’s upset a lot of people at Man United because they see me as worthy of signing a new deal at the club, so they obviously have got a different opinion to what Paul has.’’ Unlike Jack Wilshere, another victim of Scholes’s new role as a pugnacious pundit, Rooney has not bothered to contact Scholes. “I’ve never had his phone number and he’s never had mine,’’ said Rooney, giving an insight into how private a person Scholes was at Old Trafford. “He’s been a great player at Man United, probably the best player I’ve ever played with, so I’m not going to knock him as a player, but I don’t agree with his point.” Handling criticism goes with the territory of being England’s most-scrutinised, most high-profile player. “I’ve always responded well in the dressing room if I’m not doing well and if someone is shouting at me. I have no problem with that. You can see some players it really affects them. It’s not something I get concerned with.” At the start of the season, the then United manager David Moyes suggested that Rooney had gone “soft”. The pair discussed this. “He didn’t call me in. I went to see him. He felt I had lost a bit of aggression out of my game – which I was asked to do, by the way. He said he wanted me to find that aggression back. It [his discipline] was blown up after the sending off against Montenegro [in 2011]. Before that my record in terms of discipline and bookings wasn’t that bad. I was asked to stop doing that – stupid tackles. “Maybe I was trying to do too much. I thought about it a lot. It wasn’t really me. Maybe there are times when you have to try and lift the crowd with a tackle, obviously not a stupid one. A run back and tackle can lift the fans and even turn a game round.” His thoughts now turn to Italy on Saturday. In training at Urca yesterday, Rooney played central, having started left against Honduras. “I’m happy to play anywhere,’’ he said. “But if you look at the way we play, it’s not out and out on the left wing. You’re playing more inside, you’re coming inside off the line. Whoever is playing No 10, wide or up top, the manager [Roy Hodgson] gives us the freedom to rotate.’’ He knows the Italians will be a test. “The Italian defenders I’ve played against tend to read the game really well. They put themselves in good positions. But if I’m being honest, when you play a high tempo they’ve struggled. The Italian league is nowhere near the tempo of the Premier League. Even when we played AC Milan, with [Alessandro] Nesta and [Paolo] Maldini the centre-halves, they really struggled when we played a high tempo. If we can do that I am sure we will give them problems.” Rooney believes England have that tempo. “We’ve got a lot of energy, a lot of pace in the team, and if we can pick the right moments we can really hurt teams with the pace and tempo that we can hit them at. But, at international football, you can’t just go out there and attack, attack, attack. We have to be a bit cautious. This is the top end of football and you might get picked off. We have to stick to our plans that we’ve worked on in the last few weeks and pick the right moment.” Italian defenders are also masters at the dark arts of baulking, checking, ensuring strikers are unable to get close to the ball. “They are but everyone is learning that now; 10-15 years ago it was different but with the amount of foreign players in our league now, even English players are learning it now.’’ If England play against Italy as fluidly and intelligently as Rooney spoke yesterday, they might just have a chance. - Paul Hayward: Prepare for a joyous, nerve-shredding, ludicrous drama - Alan Hansen: Brazil were the best team I faced - I bared had a kick - Manaus groundsman: Pitch for England's game is in poor shape	sports

I hope to settle in as quickly as possible."	sports
Scolari: Current Brazil side as good as Ronaldo's 2002 champions - Goal.com	Host nation are well placed to repeat their success in South Korea and Japan, according to their coach, who oversaw the talents of Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and Rivaldo at that event By Kris Voakes at the Arena Corinthians, Sao Paulo Luiz Felipe Scolari says that his Brazil squad are “collectively the same” as the team he led to World Cup victory in 2002. Speaking at the Arena Corinthians, where Brazil will kick-off the 2014 showpiece on Thursday against Croatia, the Selecao coach told the world’s media that his current crop can emulate the Ronaldo-inspired success of 12 years ago. “I would say that this squad and the 2002 squad are collectively the same,” said Scolari. “There was an ability in that squad which helped to change games tactically. “This squad has players that change their games to help the team. For instance, Neymar helps to mark players if it helps the whole team." ‘Big Phil’ added that he feels his troops are ready to fulfil the dreams of the entire host nation. "We want to thank president Dilma Rousseff for her words of support and also the fans from across the country who are backing us. “The time has arrived, we are going together. This is our World Cup.” Scolari has been hit by the deaths of his brother-in-law and nephew in the build-up to the finals beginning, but he says that football has helped him to move forward as the World Cup approaches. “Yes, we have gone through difficult times together, but life goes on,” he added. “We do what we have to do and we go on. Each of us has a path to follow. “I find my strength from working with these players who dedicate themselves every day and are always trying to improve. All this helps us forget the sadness and see the beauty of what is happening around you.” Niko Kovac’s Croatia side are likely to give Brazil a tough test in their opening Group A fixture, and Scolari insists that he is focused entirely on the events of Thursday night. “I'm thinking only of tomorrow, because we have seven steps to take and we cannot jump the first of those steps. “We have prepared well, we are all fit to play, and everything that was planned was excellent… I will sleep well tonight.”	sports
Pirlo: This World Cup will be my last - Goal.com	The midfielder made his international debut 12 years ago but admits he is unlikely to be available for the national team after the tournament in Brazil Andrea Pirlo has admitted he plans to retire from international duty after this World Cup unless he is desperately needed by Italy. The midfielder has been a member of the national team since 2002 and lifted the 2006 World Cup as well as reaching the Euro 2012 final with the Azzurri. After 12 years of service, the 35-year-old is ready to bring an end to his international career unless Cesare Prandelli is struggling for options if he is not available for selection. "I'm still thinking of retiring after this World Cup, as I have reached a certain age and it is only right to leave the pitch to the generation coming through," the Juventus star told reporters. "It would be pointless to continue. If I am needed, then there’s no problem in coming back. If I come on international duty and don’t play, then I’d get angry. It is perhaps better I stay home." Pirlo was then asked about Mario Balotelli and he believes the striker's goal drought will come to an end soon. The Juventus star said: "Strikers score goals, so when they don’t come then perhaps he gets a little upset, but he just needs to focus on playing for the team and then a goal will arrive as a consequence of that. "It is the dream of every player to be at a World Cup in Brazil, the nation of football. It’s not something that happens often, so we have the chance to make this a World Cup to be remembered for all our lives." Italy are without a win in seven matches as they prepare to face Costa Rica, England and Uruguay in the group stage. 	sports
Wayne Rooney says he has no excuses with England at World Cup 2014 - Telegraph	“Maybe you guys, the media, have put me under a lot of pressure and I’ve tried to respond to that. This time I haven’t and I’m not going to. I’m going to enjoy it. I’m excited for this tournament. I’m enjoying working with the younger lads and the experienced lads. I really believe we can do well. “I’ve learnt to enjoy this one because I haven’t enjoyed the last ones, they’ve not gone well. All of a sudden you’re looking back and they’ve gone and I didn’t enjoy it. I’m going to make sure I take positive memories from this one. I hope so. I know the last tournaments haven’t gone well for me and, if this one doesn’t, I’ll have no excuses. I’ve prepared well for it.’’ Rooney is certainly better prepared than at the 2010 World Cup when he railed against England fans in Cape Town after their dissent towards a dreadful display against Algeria. “I regret that. It was the heat of the moment and it happened, and you move on. Listen, I’ll do my best for England and I’m sure the fans see that. All fans have favourite players. I’m sure the English Man United fans like me! It was stupid of me but it was a frustrating time. “The hardest thing about last time was I missed my family, and this time I’ve learnt to deal with that. Of course I miss them. They’ll be over here eventually. Not with me but they will be. To be honest, it’s good to get a few days’ rest!” Rooney has two sons, aged four and one, and the elder is beginning to note the focus on his father. “For instance, towards the end of last season, when I walked out at Old Trafford the fans were shouting and he was asking why. He’s not a massive football fan. He’s not really into it at the minute. He’s still young. I’m sure, in time, it’ll come.” As well as the maturing effects of fatherhood, Rooney’s equanimity has been helped by talking to the sports psychologist, Dr Steve Peters, who is travelling with England. “I’ve spoken to him a few times. He’s a great benefit for the team. I found him great and easy to talk to.’’ The tournament he enjoyed most was Euro 2004 when he was a teenager, playing without fear, just loving the occasion. “I did enjoy that one. I was doing well. That’s the good thing about the younger lads in the squad, like Ross [Barkley] and Raheem (Sterling). You can see that there’s no fear with them. They’ll be good players, big players for us.” He will tell them to “enjoy it”, adding “You have to enjoy the moment”. Against Ecuador in the Miami friendly, when the focus was on him after injury and some travails in front of goal, Rooney celebrated wildly scoring from three yards. “One yard! I know this is a big tournament for me which I want to do well in, so I was delighted to score. If you look at my record in us qualifying for this World Cup, I had a pretty good record. I hadn’t done too well in the friendlies, but when it counted in the qualifiers, it happened. That’s what I have to do again in this tournament.’’ He is currently on 39 goals, 10 short of Sir Bobby Charlton’s England record which he wants to beat. “It would be great,’’ said the 28-year-old. “At my age, I should break that record. I just want to keep playing, keep trying to score. If I can get Sir Bobby’s record it would be a massive achievement. I’d be absolutely delighted. I want to score goals and help England be successful. If I play well, the team will play well. I feel better than I have done for years. I’m ready for this tournament.’’ He did not particularly appreciate the critical comments from his former team-mate, Paul Scholes, about his having peaked as a player. “I don’t agree with it. I’m sure he’s upset a lot of people at Man United because they see me as worthy of signing a new deal at the club, so they obviously have got a different opinion to what Paul has.’’ Unlike Jack Wilshere, another victim of Scholes’s new role as a pugnacious pundit, Rooney has not bothered to contact Scholes. “I’ve never had his phone number and he’s never had mine,’’ said Rooney, giving an insight into how private a person Scholes was at Old Trafford. “He’s been a great player at Man United, probably the best player I’ve ever played with, so I’m not going to knock him as a player, but I don’t agree with his point.” Handling criticism goes with the territory of being England’s most-scrutinised, most high-profile player. “I’ve always responded well in the dressing room if I’m not doing well and if someone is shouting at me. I have no problem with that. You can see some players it really affects them. It’s not something I get concerned with.” At the start of the season, the then United manager David Moyes suggested that Rooney had gone “soft”. The pair discussed this. “He didn’t call me in. I went to see him. He felt I had lost a bit of aggression out of my game – which I was asked to do, by the way. He said he wanted me to find that aggression back. It [his discipline] was blown up after the sending off against Montenegro [in 2011]. Before that my record in terms of discipline and bookings wasn’t that bad. I was asked to stop doing that – stupid tackles. “Maybe I was trying to do too much. I thought about it a lot. It wasn’t really me. Maybe there are times when you have to try and lift the crowd with a tackle, obviously not a stupid one. A run back and tackle can lift the fans and even turn a game round.” His thoughts now turn to Italy on Saturday. In training at Urca yesterday, Rooney played central, having started left against Honduras. “I’m happy to play anywhere,’’ he said. “But if you look at the way we play, it’s not out and out on the left wing. You’re playing more inside, you’re coming inside off the line. Whoever is playing No 10, wide or up top, the manager [Roy Hodgson] gives us the freedom to rotate.’’ He knows the Italians will be a test. “The Italian defenders I’ve played against tend to read the game really well. They put themselves in good positions. But if I’m being honest, when you play a high tempo they’ve struggled. The Italian league is nowhere near the tempo of the Premier League. Even when we played AC Milan, with [Alessandro] Nesta and [Paolo] Maldini the centre-halves, they really struggled when we played a high tempo. If we can do that I am sure we will give them problems.” Rooney believes England have that tempo. “We’ve got a lot of energy, a lot of pace in the team, and if we can pick the right moments we can really hurt teams with the pace and tempo that we can hit them at. But, at international football, you can’t just go out there and attack, attack, attack. We have to be a bit cautious. This is the top end of football and you might get picked off. We have to stick to our plans that we’ve worked on in the last few weeks and pick the right moment.” Italian defenders are also masters at the dark arts of baulking, checking, ensuring strikers are unable to get close to the ball. “They are but everyone is learning that now; 10-15 years ago it was different but with the amount of foreign players in our league now, even English players are learning it now.’’ If England play against Italy as fluidly and intelligently as Rooney spoke yesterday, they might just have a chance. - Paul Hayward: Prepare for a joyous, nerve-shredding, ludicrous drama - Alan Hansen: Brazil were the best team I faced - I bared had a kick - Manaus groundsman: Pitch for England's game is in poor shape	sports
World Cup 2014: Luiz Felipe Scolari tells Brazilians 'this is our time' ahead of Croatia opener - Telegraph	For Scolari, who described himself as a “coach, a father, an uncle, a friend, someone who has to speak a bit harsh” to his players, there was also the personal tragedies of first losing his brother-in-law, in late May, and then, this week, his nephew during the days in the run-up to this match. “Yes we have gone through difficult times together and we know what this means,” Scolari said. “But life goes on and we do what we have to do. And we go on. Each one has a path to follow and I find my strength from working with these players. These players dedicate themselves every day and work. “They are always trying to improve and all this makes us, even when we are feeling sad, forget the sadness and feel the beauty around us. Arriving here at the airport, at the Corinthians stadium, it is a beautiful stadium and we forget the sad aspects and think of the 99 per cent of positive things in our lives.” To Scolari’s left is Neymar, the 22-year-old striker who is his country’s great hope and poster boy for this tournament, who has willingly taken the mythical No 10 Brazil shirt, and who happily says he is prepared to embrace the weight of that expectation. “As Mr Scolari has said the time has arrived that all Brazil and the whole world was waiting for,” Neymar said. “We hope that this last day goes by very quickly. I am anxious of course but I am also extremely happy to be where I am. Many people would like to be here. I have many messages from my friends saying I have achieved their dreams. “The 12th player – or even the main player of the Brazilian squad – are the supporters. We are at home and if the supporters are behind us 100 per cent it will be very difficult to beat Brazil.” There is ambitious hope that the Barcelona striker can surpass both Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo – the two “star players” that Neymar himself admires and draws “inspiration” from – and become this tournament’s outstanding performer. If he does so then surely Brazil will triumph? “I want to be the best player at the World Cup. I don’t want to just be the striker,” Neymar acknowledged. “I want to win the World Cup. That is what I have always dreamt of.” Scolari nodded approvingly as Neymar spoke and in the questioning from Brazilian journalists there was as much a sense of seeking reassurance as any attempt at analysis. “I try to be the coach I always was,” Scolari said as, unsurprisingly, comparisons were drawn between this squad of players and those who won the World Cup with him in Japan 12 years ago. “I always worked this way, I was never a coach in a different manner even if it was a big team or a small team. I think I am a mixture of everything you said – a father, an uncle, a friend, someone who has to speak a bit harsh. I am a football coach the way that most coaches are. You have to have leadership and have to command them and you have to study and define situations and above all take decisions.” Scolari has been decisive. It appears he has ignored demands to change the team that triumphed in last summer’s Confederations Cup, his faith in Oscar and Paulinho, two out-of-sorts Premier League performers, appears unshakeable. “We are ready,” Scolari said. He was convincing.	sports

"You've got to have a great team spirit," he said. "Roman has said himself that there is no point in arguing about who should be number one. "He would be ready to play at any time, but he knows the overall situation. The players are pushing each other to greater things with their performances."	sports

Arsenal have not indicated they want to activate a buy-back clause on Fabregas and the Spaniard is keen to return to the Premier League. Chelsea have been trying to structure a deal to sign Fabregas that would see Arsenal miss out on any payment for him. Arsenal would be due around 50 per cent of any profit Barcelona make on the Spaniard, but a £27m transfer would not be enough to earn the Gunners a sell-on fee.	sports
World Cup 2014: Luiz Felipe Scolari tells Brazilians 'this is our time' ahead of Croatia opener - Telegraph	For Scolari, who described himself as a “coach, a father, an uncle, a friend, someone who has to speak a bit harsh” to his players, there was also the personal tragedies of first losing his brother-in-law, in late May, and then, this week, his nephew during the days in the run-up to this match. “Yes we have gone through difficult times together and we know what this means,” Scolari said. “But life goes on and we do what we have to do. And we go on. Each one has a path to follow and I find my strength from working with these players. These players dedicate themselves every day and work. “They are always trying to improve and all this makes us, even when we are feeling sad, forget the sadness and feel the beauty around us. Arriving here at the airport, at the Corinthians stadium, it is a beautiful stadium and we forget the sad aspects and think of the 99 per cent of positive things in our lives.” To Scolari’s left is Neymar, the 22-year-old striker who is his country’s great hope and poster boy for this tournament, who has willingly taken the mythical No 10 Brazil shirt, and who happily says he is prepared to embrace the weight of that expectation. “As Mr Scolari has said the time has arrived that all Brazil and the whole world was waiting for,” Neymar said. “We hope that this last day goes by very quickly. I am anxious of course but I am also extremely happy to be where I am. Many people would like to be here. I have many messages from my friends saying I have achieved their dreams. “The 12th player – or even the main player of the Brazilian squad – are the supporters. We are at home and if the supporters are behind us 100 per cent it will be very difficult to beat Brazil.” There is ambitious hope that the Barcelona striker can surpass both Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo – the two “star players” that Neymar himself admires and draws “inspiration” from – and become this tournament’s outstanding performer. If he does so then surely Brazil will triumph? “I want to be the best player at the World Cup. I don’t want to just be the striker,” Neymar acknowledged. “I want to win the World Cup. That is what I have always dreamt of.” Scolari nodded approvingly as Neymar spoke and in the questioning from Brazilian journalists there was as much a sense of seeking reassurance as any attempt at analysis. “I try to be the coach I always was,” Scolari said as, unsurprisingly, comparisons were drawn between this squad of players and those who won the World Cup with him in Japan 12 years ago. “I always worked this way, I was never a coach in a different manner even if it was a big team or a small team. I think I am a mixture of everything you said – a father, an uncle, a friend, someone who has to speak a bit harsh. I am a football coach the way that most coaches are. You have to have leadership and have to command them and you have to study and define situations and above all take decisions.” Scolari has been decisive. It appears he has ignored demands to change the team that triumphed in last summer’s Confederations Cup, his faith in Oscar and Paulinho, two out-of-sorts Premier League performers, appears unshakeable. “We are ready,” Scolari said. He was convincing.	sports

Firefighters veto provisional stands at World Cup stadium - Goal.com	The Arena das Dunas site has not passed a safety inspection and is not yet in position to host Friday's opening game between Mexico and Cameroon Brazil’s overdue and over-budget World Cup 2014 preparations have been plunged into further chaos following news that the Arena das Dunas in Natal may not be ready for its opening match of the tournament. Mexico are due to face Cameroon on Friday in what is scheduled to be the first match held at the stadium. While Secopa (Extraordinary Secretary for World Cup Related Subjects) has guaranteed that the stadium is all but finished, the fire department responsible for signing the order of release for the use of the site disagree. According to firefighters, there should have been a safety inspection of the site on Tuesday, but they were not authorised to make their visit, meaning that the stadium is yet to be cleared to host matches. The Arena de Sao Paulo, the stadium scheduled to host the opening game of the tournament between Brazil and Croatia on Thursday, faced similar issues. The Sao Paulo firefighters department refused to sign off on its temporary seating, which led to Fifa recalling a number of sold tickets. Fans that acquired seats in that part of the stadium were forced to exchange their purchased seats for those situated in other areas of the stadium, causing the capacity to fall from around 68,000 to little over 60,000.	sports

Spain v Holland: We want revenge against Spain, says Wesley Sneijder - Telegraph	“It felt very sour. That will always be my rock bottom. “We were so close to penalties and that game was still there, but Iniesta scored just three minutes before the end of the extra time. “It was a shame because we had beaten Brazil in the quarter-final, a night when we turned the whole game. “I scored twice. Two goals, one with my head, and a 1-0 deficit turned into a place in the semi-finals. “You just felt at one point that we were going to win. And then the final against Spain just went wrong.” Spain go into Friday’s fixture as favourites, with Van Gaal’s blend of experience and emerging youngsters expected to face a battle with Chile for the runners-up spot - and a potential second round clash with Brazil. Sneijder insists, however, that Holland can get the positive result they need against Spain to avoid a losing start to the tournament. “This is a big week but it's only one game,” Sneijder said. “We need a result against Spain. That’s the point. “We may not have a top team, but we definitely have a chance to fight hard and we play compact and can switch the ball quickly. We have a chance.” With Guus Hiddink due to replace Manchester United-bound Van Gaal as coach following theWorld Cup, the Dutch team is expected to be rebuilt ahead of Euro 2016 in France. But Sneijder insists he is ready to prove in Brazil his ability to extend his international career to the next World Cup in Russia in 2018. “I’m very proud of my international career,” Sneijder said. “I’m not a captain, but still a leader. “The team spirit is good, much better than two years ago (at Euro 2012) and I will do everything to keep it that way because that is important at a major tournament. I know that from experience. “These are my sixth major finals but I will keep going. You will see me in four years.” Dutch winger Arjen Robben, whose training ground clash with defender Bruno Martins Indi earlier this week hinted at tensions within the squad, echoed Sneijder’s claims that Holland will test Spain by backing Van Gaal’s youngsters to impress in Salvador. “We have a young team, but it is talented,” Robben told Fifa.com. “Experience is important, especially mentally. But on the pitch it is all about playing in the right way, doing what you have to do - and it doesn’t matter if you are 22 or 32. You just have to do what is asked for. “That said, in my opinion Brazil, Argentina, Spain and Germany are the favourites. It will be hard for us because we have to play a very tough group. “Spain are the reigning world and European champions, and two teams from Spain played this season’s Champions League final. That says it all. “Chile also have a very strong team with really good players who want to play in an attacking way. “And Australia are physically strong. We have played a few matches against them and were never able to win. “But our preparations have been going well so far and I’m really happy we are in Brazil now. You can feel the tournament is about to start. “Brazil is one of the greatest football countries in the world - maybe the greatest - so it is fantastic the World Cup has been organised here.”	sports
Croatia star Ivan Rakitic excited by 'dream' Barcelona switch - Goal.com	The Croatia international has expressed his delight as he edges closer to completing a move to Camp Nou from the Europa League winners Sevilla midfielder Ivan Rakitic is revelling in a "dream come true" as he looks set to seal a switch to La Liga giants Barcelona. The 26-year-old is expected to move to Camp Nou after he has represented Croatia at the World Cup, with his performances during Sevilla's Europa League victory last season having caught the eye of several of Europe's biggest clubs. And Rakitic is thrilled to be on the verge of a move to the Catalan outfit, who are looking to rebuild their squad after missing out on the Liga, Champions League and Copa del Rey trophies last season. "I am very happy," Rakitic told Catalan newspaper Sport. "It is a dream come true." Barcelona are believed to have agreed a deal in the region of €20 million for the Croatia international. Rakitic's arrival is expected to hasten the departure of Cesc Fabregas, with Premier League sides Chelsea,  Manchester Unitedand Manchester City all linked with the Spain midfielder's signature. Barcelona appointed Luis Enrique as head coach last month after parting company with Gerardo Martino, who lasted just one season at the helm.	sports

The Dutch lost 1-0 to Spain thanks to an extra-time Andres Iniesta goal at Soccer City in Johannesburg four years ago, after Robben missed what proved to be a pivotal one-on-one with Iker Casillas on the hour mark. But the 30-year-old says he has no regrets and can’t wait for this weekend's big kick-off in Brazil. "A World Cup is always something special and I am very excited to be in Brazil for this one," he told Fifa.com. "South Africa was a really great tournament for me. It was obviously a big disappointment we lost the final, but I am still really proud of what we all achieved together at that tournament." The former Chelsea and Real Madrid star went on to say he was confident a young Dutch team can perform at the tournament, but conceded they are not among the favourites. "Experience is important, especially mentally. But on the pitch it is all about playing in the right way, doing what you have to do - and it doesn’t matter if you are 22 or 32.

World Cup 2014: Sepp Blatter’s big idea: let managers put referees on the spot - Telegraph	That brought a smattering of applause, but not from members of Uefa, who queued up on Tuesday to tell Blatter to stand down. The revolt, led in part by Football Association chairman Greg Dyke, was branded by Blatter as “the most disrespectful thing I’ve experienced in my entire life”. Yet, it will not stop him clinging on to power, which he could do indefinitely after member associations voted against the principle of term limits being introduced for presidents and other executives. As well as calling for greater use of technology, Blatter even floated the idea of Fifa taking football to other planets. With not a whiff of irony considering the storm over its decision to award the 2022 tournament to Qatar, the Swiss said: “We shall wonder if one day our game is played on another planet? Why not? Then we will have not only a World Cup we will have interplanetary competitions.” The Qatar vote is being looked into by Fifa’s chief investigator, who on Wednesday night vowed to examine evidence published by the British media in recent weeks before filing his report into allegations of corruption surrounding the 2010 vote. As revealed by Telegraph Sport on Wednesday, Michael J Garcia has asked The Sunday Times to provide him with the documents it obtained, which purportedly relate to Fifa’s controversial decision to hand the tournament to the Gulf State. Blatter this week claimed the investigations spearheaded by the Telegraph as being motivated by “racism”, an outburst that saw him taken to task by Dyke. Garcia promised to take them seriously, despite concluding his own inquiries on Monday. The American said: “What we can do, and what we have done, including in response to recent reports, is request any materials others have that they believe would assist in our inquiry.” Insisting he would produce a “comprehensive” report – expected late next month – he added: “What we cannot do and what I will not do is postpone indefinitely completing our work on the possibility someone may publish something we may not have seen.” The head of the investigatory chamber of Fifa’s ethics committee also warned that anyone who failed to cooperate with his investigation faced punishment. That could spell trouble for former executive committee member Franz Beckenbauer, the Germany legend who voted in 2010 but refused to meet with Garcia. The barrage of criticism aimed at Fifa over what Blatter dubbed “Qatartgate” continued on Wednesday when former FA chairman Lord Triesman accused it of acting like a “mafia family”. Triesman, the initial chairman of England’s doomed bid to host the 2018 World Cup who previously claimed four Fifa members sought bribes in return for votes said: “Fifa, I’m afraid, behaves like a mafia family.” He added of Blatter’s racism accusations: “Don Corleone, I believe, would have recognised the tactics and he probably would have admired them.” More accusations of “racism” were levelled at the British media at congress on Wednesday by the head of the Congolese FA. There was also some shameless plugging of Fifa’s €23 million motion picture, United Passions, while Fifa announced plans to pay out £120 million in total bonuses to its national associations and confederations from its World Cup revenue of an estimated £2.7 billion. Each of the 209 member countries will get £150,000 this month and should receive a further £300,000 early next year. The six continental bodies will get £1.5 million this month and should receive £2.7 million more next year.	sports

World Cup 2014: Prepare for joyous, nerve-shredding, ludicrous drama as Brazil's carnival begins - Telegraph	This is a World Cup that cannot shimmy around the problems of Brazilian life and society but still strives for what Socrates called “the ludicrous and joyous” drama of football between nations, watched by the world, in a narrative as broad and strong as the Amazon, which England will fly along to face Italy in Manaus on Saturday. Brazil are threatened on all sides by rich European countries who plunder their best players as well as their old enemy to the south, Argentina, plus the former colonial master – Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal. Ronaldo showed no sign of injury in Portugal’s 5-1 friendly win over the Republic of Ireland, and is now said to be billeted in a VIP suite where he can contemplate his private battle against Lionel Messi, whose vomiting problem has been the source of much curiosity. Messi, now 26, doubled-up again shortly after coming on in Argentina’s last warm-up match and has thrown-up half a dozen times for club and country. “Nerves,” says Argentina’s coach Alejandro Sabella, whose forward line is the most potent at this World Cup. “I reckon that in these moments there is anxiety more than anything. It’s difficult to remain calm.” The Ronaldo-Messi struggle for supremacy was not meant to be described in such malodorous terms, but at least Messi’s nausea tells us that today’s one-man corporations still care about their work. Neymar, who now wears the sacred No 10 for Brazil, has these two to cope with on top of his country’s expectations. Wayne Rooney, who was once compared to Pele by Sven-Goran Eriksson in one of his giddier moments, is another with a sword of judgment poised over his head. In two World Cups, Messi has scored only once, in a 6-0 win over Serbia in 2006, and the heat is on him to convert brilliance at Barcelona into something resembling Diego Maradona’s majesty with Argentina. He is not without accomplices in this cross-border raid. Across the forward line Sabella can call on Gonzalo Higuaín, Sergio Agüero, Ezequiel Lavezzi and Ángel Di Maria, none of which is good news for Bosnia (the debutants), Iran or Nigeria, who make up Group F. These are not the only A-list strikers, but some are struggling for fitness as their opening games approach. Uruguay’s Luis Suárez and Spain’s Diego Costa are among those walking the fine line between recovery and further breakdown. Suárez, the Premier League’s player of the year, underwent arthroscopic surgery on May 22 and trained on his own on Tuesday. Costa, from Lagarto in Brazil, was granted Spanish citizenship last year and could be in for a lively reception from the home crowds. The day before England play Italy on a pitch that looks in photographs like a jungle landing strip, the world and European champions Spain stage a rematch of the 2010 'karate’ final in Johannesburg, which Spain won at the expense of Holland, managed by Manchester United’s autocrat in waiting, Louis van Gaal. Spain hunt a double double. They captured the 2008 and 2012 European Championships either side of their World Cup victory in South Africa, from which 16 members of the squad survive. Spain are foremost among those teams hoping to overturn the reality that all South American World Cups have been won by South American teams. Spain’s dominance of world football can be seen as a victory over the Brazilian talent production machine, to the extent that Scolari’s men all spoke of a huge psychological boost with their Confederations Cup win over Vicente del Bosque’s team here last summer. Even Pele’s country had fallen prey to the notion of Spanish invincibility. Now this tournament offers a chance to restore their No 1 position after a six-year pageant of tiki‑taka-based play. This opening fixture is a chance to take almost sadistic pleasure in the sight of 23 footballers in the beautiful buttercup shirts of their land carry the hopes of 200 million Brazilians, with Neymar the dream catcher in chief. Carlos Alberto Parreira, coach of the 1994‑winning team in America, told reporters that the 22-year-old Neymar’s status as Brazil’s to craque (star) has piled pressure on the team’s poster boy. “A craque can make a difference from one move to another, but it’s the team that wins,” said Parreira, who is now Brazil’s technical director. “Like Maradona, Romario, Pele and all the players who made stand-out World Cup performances, he’ll win with a team behind him.” No host team meanwhile have ever lost an opening match. Brazil lift the World Cup curtain for the first time since their 2-1 win over Scotland at the Stade de France in 1998 and are closing in on La Hexa (a sixth win), two years before the 2016 Olympics drop another spaceship on the Brazilian economy, already reeling from the likely $12 billion cost of staging this event. This week the Brazilian business magazine Isto E Dinheiro called Scolari the “chief executive of the sixth world title”, as if this World Cup were a commercial takeover rather than a hard-fought competition. Before the ball rolls off the centre circle at the mostly-finished stadium in Sao Paulo, Brazil is trapped between the old sense of entitlement and a blazing urge to reject Fifa and its own government’s extravagance. “This is the strangest atmosphere I’ve ever witnessed in Brazil before a World Cup, as apprehension and apathy threaten the normal excitement,” the historian Antonio Risério told The New York Times, who also reported that only 34 per cent of Brazilians think the economy will be improved by the four-week party. Arnaldo Bloch, a columnist with O Globo, wrote: “That talk about the national team being the patrimony of Brazil, the affirmation of our identity and civility and cordiality – no one swallows that anymore.” But football is an opiate that usually finds a route round the body. As the marvellous Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano observed of the old culture: “Brazil has the most beautiful game in the world, made of hip feints, undulations of the torso and legs in flight, all of which came from capoeira, the warrior dance of black slaves, and from the joyful dances of big city slums. There are no right angles in Brazilian football, just as there are none in the Rio mountains.” Who will not look for surviving evidence of this culture when Thiago Silva leads the hosts up the tunnel here in Sao Paulo? However England fare against Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica, English viewers will have little difficulty identifying with Scolari’s outfit. A former Chelsea manager himself, he summoned six Premier League players, as well as Julio Cesar, the goalkeeper recently at Queens Park Rangers. David Luiz, Oscar, Ramires and Willian from Chelsea join Manchester City’s Fernandinho and Paulinho of Spurs in Brazil’s 23-man home guard. This pattern is repeated across the tournament, where 110 Premier League players will represent 26 of the 32 countries. Only Burnley and West Ham United from England’s top flight are without a single player in Brazil. Chelsea lead the way with 17. Beaten in the last World Cup quarter-finals by France (2006) and Holland (2010), Brazil seek their first win since 2002 in Yokohama, when the three Rs of Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho overwhelmed a Germany side now under intense pressure to convert promise into hard metal. Ronaldo’s goalscoring record is under threat from Germany’s Miroslav Klose, a functional finisher by comparison, who needs one more to match the Brazilian Ronaldo’s 15. Others edge towards landmarks. Span’s Iker Casillas has kept seven clean sheets in 15 World Cup finals matches and is three shy of the record of 10 held by Peter Shilton and Fabien Barthez. With one more blockade, Casillas will also pass Walter Zenga’s 1990 record of 517 minutes unbeaten. Algeria seek to avoid a place in history rather than grab one. Failure to score against Belgium in Belo Horizonte would render them the first country to go six successive World Cup games without a goal. At the other end of the glamour scale, Jürgen Klinsmann (the US coach) and Didier Deschamps (France) endeavour to join Brazil’s Mario Zagallo and Germany’s Franz Beckenbauer as the only men to have won World Cups as a player and a manager. Only Vittori Pozzo has won two trophies as a coach (with Italy in 1934 and 1938). Scolari or Del Bosque could take equal rank in the final in Rio de Janeiro on July 13. Despite all their talent and player development system, Germany have not won a trophy since Euro 96 in England. They were runners-up at Euro 2008 and third in the 2006 and 2010 World Cups. At Euro 2012 they were undone by Italy and Mario Balotelli in a game that was seen by many as a near-formality for the Nationalmannschaft. Five days before their game with Portugal in Salvador, Germany were embroiled in a row with 11 locals in the Santo Andre community over excessive security near their base. “We had wanted to ride by bike to our training ground everyday, but unfortunately this is not possible, because the police don’t allow it,” Oliver Bierhoff, Germany’s team manager, complained. The numbers say that in World Cup history 76 teams have played 772 games involving 6,598 players in 19 runnings of the event. This 20th staging lifts Brazil out of the sepia of 1950 and asks huge questions of the country’s infrastructure, government, economy and treatment of its own people, who have plenty of justifications for their grievances. Fifa announced on the eve of the opening ceremony that its 209 national member associations and six regional confederations will be paid bonuses totalling $200 million (£119 million) as revenue projections for Brazil 2014 shot up from $3.8 billion (£2.3 billion) to $4.5 billion (£2.7 billion). These hands‑outs are 40 per cent higher than in South Africa four years ago. Lord Triesman, the former Football Association chairman, alleged: “Fifa, I’m afraid, behaves like a mafia family. It has a decades-long tradition of bribes, bungs and corruption.” Brazil’s president Dilma Rousseff, tortured by the military junta in the early 1970s, portrayed her country as one striving for greater fairness. “I’m certain visitors will mix with a happy, generous and hospitable people, and be impressed by a nation full of natural beauty and which fights each day to become more equal,” she said. There are other kinds of fighting, too. In the first reported case of fan-on-fan violence, an Argentine supporter’s finger was broken when three Brazilians tried to rip a flag from his hands in Belo Horizonte. At a dream final of Argentina v Brazil just over four weeks from now, the chap with the broken finger can gain his revenge, especially if Messi can become the king of his continent ahead of Neymar. - Wayne Rooney: This time I have no excuses for failing to perform - Alan Hansen: Brazil were the best team I faced - I bared had a kick - Manaus groundsman: Pitch for England's game is in poor shape	sports

World Cup 2014: Sepp Blatter’s big idea: let managers put referees on the spot - Telegraph	That brought a smattering of applause, but not from members of Uefa, who queued up on Tuesday to tell Blatter to stand down. The revolt, led in part by Football Association chairman Greg Dyke, was branded by Blatter as “the most disrespectful thing I’ve experienced in my entire life”. Yet, it will not stop him clinging on to power, which he could do indefinitely after member associations voted against the principle of term limits being introduced for presidents and other executives. As well as calling for greater use of technology, Blatter even floated the idea of Fifa taking football to other planets. With not a whiff of irony considering the storm over its decision to award the 2022 tournament to Qatar, the Swiss said: “We shall wonder if one day our game is played on another planet? Why not? Then we will have not only a World Cup we will have interplanetary competitions.” The Qatar vote is being looked into by Fifa’s chief investigator, who on Wednesday night vowed to examine evidence published by the British media in recent weeks before filing his report into allegations of corruption surrounding the 2010 vote. As revealed by Telegraph Sport on Wednesday, Michael J Garcia has asked The Sunday Times to provide him with the documents it obtained, which purportedly relate to Fifa’s controversial decision to hand the tournament to the Gulf State. Blatter this week claimed the investigations spearheaded by the Telegraph as being motivated by “racism”, an outburst that saw him taken to task by Dyke. Garcia promised to take them seriously, despite concluding his own inquiries on Monday. The American said: “What we can do, and what we have done, including in response to recent reports, is request any materials others have that they believe would assist in our inquiry.” Insisting he would produce a “comprehensive” report – expected late next month – he added: “What we cannot do and what I will not do is postpone indefinitely completing our work on the possibility someone may publish something we may not have seen.” The head of the investigatory chamber of Fifa’s ethics committee also warned that anyone who failed to cooperate with his investigation faced punishment. That could spell trouble for former executive committee member Franz Beckenbauer, the Germany legend who voted in 2010 but refused to meet with Garcia. The barrage of criticism aimed at Fifa over what Blatter dubbed “Qatartgate” continued on Wednesday when former FA chairman Lord Triesman accused it of acting like a “mafia family”. Triesman, the initial chairman of England’s doomed bid to host the 2018 World Cup who previously claimed four Fifa members sought bribes in return for votes said: “Fifa, I’m afraid, behaves like a mafia family.” He added of Blatter’s racism accusations: “Don Corleone, I believe, would have recognised the tactics and he probably would have admired them.” More accusations of “racism” were levelled at the British media at congress on Wednesday by the head of the Congolese FA. There was also some shameless plugging of Fifa’s €23 million motion picture, United Passions, while Fifa announced plans to pay out £120 million in total bonuses to its national associations and confederations from its World Cup revenue of an estimated £2.7 billion. Each of the 209 member countries will get £150,000 this month and should receive a further £300,000 early next year. The six continental bodies will get £1.5 million this month and should receive £2.7 million more next year.	sports
Rooney: I have massive role to play for England - Goal.com	The Manchester United star's place in Roy Hodgson's starting XI has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks but he remains adamant he can be integral to the team By Greg Stobart in Rio de Janeiro Wayne Rooney insists he still has a "massive" role to play in an England squad he considers the best he has played in. The Manchester United striker has found his place in the side under scrutiny ahead of Saturday’s World Cup opener against Italy in Manaus, particularly after he was criticised by former team-mate Paul Scholes. Rooney has never scored in eight World Cup appearances but is adamant that he can lead England’s attack in Brazil this summer as an integral part of Roy Hodgson’s youthful squad. “The future is bright, there’s so much ability in the team,” Rooney said in a press conference at England’s training base in Urca. “The younger players are bringing a lot of energy and excitement to the team. It’s probably the best squad I’ve been a part of with England. “It’s a joy to be a part of. I still feel I have a massive role to play in the team.” Rooney revealed that team-mate Danny Welbeck will be fit to face Italy on Satuday despite missing training on Wednesday with a thigh problem sustained on Tuesday. And the 28-year-old reckons Italy should be worried about stopping England in the Amazon jungle, despite the Three Lions’ quarter-finals defeat to the Azzurri on penalties at Euro 2012. “Danny [Welbeck] will be fine, I’m sure he will be ready for Saturday. He’s just not risked anything today. “Italy should be thinking about how to control our team. They have good players but so do we. They should worry about us. “The target is to try and win the tournament. That’s what we’ve prepared to do. It’s obviously a different set up to 2006 and 2010 but the goal is the same, which is to win it.”	sports
Mesut Ozil says Germany want to win World Cup for Joachim Low - Goal.com	The Arsenal midfielder says claiming the trophy would be a fitting tribute to a coach who has revolutionised the national team Germany midfielder Mezut Ozil says he is desperate to win the World Cup for coach Joachim Low. Germany have arrived in Brazil seeking their fourth world title and were handed a tough Group G draw featuring Portugal, Ghana and USA. The former Real Madrid man says he and his team-mates are desperate to claim the crown as a thank you to Low, who Ozil says has revolutionised the national team during his spell in charge. “He's introduced a totally new German national team - one that is really respected all over the world,” Ozil told the official Arsenal club website. “Wherever we go, I think opponents are reluctant to play us because we are very strong. If you look at the German team over the last couple of years, you can see that we have continuously played excellent football.” Low, 54, took charge of the side following World Cup 2006 and finished runners-up at Euro 2008 before making it to the semi-finals of both World Cup 2010 and Euro 2012. And Ozil is keen to go a step further in Brazil this month. “[Low] is one of the best in the world and we're happy to have him around the team. “I hope he will finally be rewarded because in the past we've lost in the semi-finals or final and to lose when you are so close is always sad.”	sports
World Cup 2014: Prepare for joyous, nerve-shredding, ludicrous drama as Brazil's carnival begins - Telegraph	This is a World Cup that cannot shimmy around the problems of Brazilian life and society but still strives for what Socrates called “the ludicrous and joyous” drama of football between nations, watched by the world, in a narrative as broad and strong as the Amazon, which England will fly along to face Italy in Manaus on Saturday. Brazil are threatened on all sides by rich European countries who plunder their best players as well as their old enemy to the south, Argentina, plus the former colonial master – Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal. Ronaldo showed no sign of injury in Portugal’s 5-1 friendly win over the Republic of Ireland, and is now said to be billeted in a VIP suite where he can contemplate his private battle against Lionel Messi, whose vomiting problem has been the source of much curiosity. Messi, now 26, doubled-up again shortly after coming on in Argentina’s last warm-up match and has thrown-up half a dozen times for club and country. “Nerves,” says Argentina’s coach Alejandro Sabella, whose forward line is the most potent at this World Cup. “I reckon that in these moments there is anxiety more than anything. It’s difficult to remain calm.” The Ronaldo-Messi struggle for supremacy was not meant to be described in such malodorous terms, but at least Messi’s nausea tells us that today’s one-man corporations still care about their work. Neymar, who now wears the sacred No 10 for Brazil, has these two to cope with on top of his country’s expectations. Wayne Rooney, who was once compared to Pele by Sven-Goran Eriksson in one of his giddier moments, is another with a sword of judgment poised over his head. In two World Cups, Messi has scored only once, in a 6-0 win over Serbia in 2006, and the heat is on him to convert brilliance at Barcelona into something resembling Diego Maradona’s majesty with Argentina. He is not without accomplices in this cross-border raid. Across the forward line Sabella can call on Gonzalo Higuaín, Sergio Agüero, Ezequiel Lavezzi and Ángel Di Maria, none of which is good news for Bosnia (the debutants), Iran or Nigeria, who make up Group F. These are not the only A-list strikers, but some are struggling for fitness as their opening games approach. Uruguay’s Luis Suárez and Spain’s Diego Costa are among those walking the fine line between recovery and further breakdown. Suárez, the Premier League’s player of the year, underwent arthroscopic surgery on May 22 and trained on his own on Tuesday. Costa, from Lagarto in Brazil, was granted Spanish citizenship last year and could be in for a lively reception from the home crowds. The day before England play Italy on a pitch that looks in photographs like a jungle landing strip, the world and European champions Spain stage a rematch of the 2010 'karate’ final in Johannesburg, which Spain won at the expense of Holland, managed by Manchester United’s autocrat in waiting, Louis van Gaal. Spain hunt a double double. They captured the 2008 and 2012 European Championships either side of their World Cup victory in South Africa, from which 16 members of the squad survive. Spain are foremost among those teams hoping to overturn the reality that all South American World Cups have been won by South American teams. Spain’s dominance of world football can be seen as a victory over the Brazilian talent production machine, to the extent that Scolari’s men all spoke of a huge psychological boost with their Confederations Cup win over Vicente del Bosque’s team here last summer. Even Pele’s country had fallen prey to the notion of Spanish invincibility. Now this tournament offers a chance to restore their No 1 position after a six-year pageant of tiki‑taka-based play. This opening fixture is a chance to take almost sadistic pleasure in the sight of 23 footballers in the beautiful buttercup shirts of their land carry the hopes of 200 million Brazilians, with Neymar the dream catcher in chief. Carlos Alberto Parreira, coach of the 1994‑winning team in America, told reporters that the 22-year-old Neymar’s status as Brazil’s to craque (star) has piled pressure on the team’s poster boy. “A craque can make a difference from one move to another, but it’s the team that wins,” said Parreira, who is now Brazil’s technical director. “Like Maradona, Romario, Pele and all the players who made stand-out World Cup performances, he’ll win with a team behind him.” No host team meanwhile have ever lost an opening match. Brazil lift the World Cup curtain for the first time since their 2-1 win over Scotland at the Stade de France in 1998 and are closing in on La Hexa (a sixth win), two years before the 2016 Olympics drop another spaceship on the Brazilian economy, already reeling from the likely $12 billion cost of staging this event. This week the Brazilian business magazine Isto E Dinheiro called Scolari the “chief executive of the sixth world title”, as if this World Cup were a commercial takeover rather than a hard-fought competition. Before the ball rolls off the centre circle at the mostly-finished stadium in Sao Paulo, Brazil is trapped between the old sense of entitlement and a blazing urge to reject Fifa and its own government’s extravagance. “This is the strangest atmosphere I’ve ever witnessed in Brazil before a World Cup, as apprehension and apathy threaten the normal excitement,” the historian Antonio Risério told The New York Times, who also reported that only 34 per cent of Brazilians think the economy will be improved by the four-week party. Arnaldo Bloch, a columnist with O Globo, wrote: “That talk about the national team being the patrimony of Brazil, the affirmation of our identity and civility and cordiality – no one swallows that anymore.” But football is an opiate that usually finds a route round the body. As the marvellous Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano observed of the old culture: “Brazil has the most beautiful game in the world, made of hip feints, undulations of the torso and legs in flight, all of which came from capoeira, the warrior dance of black slaves, and from the joyful dances of big city slums. There are no right angles in Brazilian football, just as there are none in the Rio mountains.” Who will not look for surviving evidence of this culture when Thiago Silva leads the hosts up the tunnel here in Sao Paulo? However England fare against Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica, English viewers will have little difficulty identifying with Scolari’s outfit. A former Chelsea manager himself, he summoned six Premier League players, as well as Julio Cesar, the goalkeeper recently at Queens Park Rangers. David Luiz, Oscar, Ramires and Willian from Chelsea join Manchester City’s Fernandinho and Paulinho of Spurs in Brazil’s 23-man home guard. This pattern is repeated across the tournament, where 110 Premier League players will represent 26 of the 32 countries. Only Burnley and West Ham United from England’s top flight are without a single player in Brazil. Chelsea lead the way with 17. Beaten in the last World Cup quarter-finals by France (2006) and Holland (2010), Brazil seek their first win since 2002 in Yokohama, when the three Rs of Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho overwhelmed a Germany side now under intense pressure to convert promise into hard metal. Ronaldo’s goalscoring record is under threat from Germany’s Miroslav Klose, a functional finisher by comparison, who needs one more to match the Brazilian Ronaldo’s 15. Others edge towards landmarks. Span’s Iker Casillas has kept seven clean sheets in 15 World Cup finals matches and is three shy of the record of 10 held by Peter Shilton and Fabien Barthez. With one more blockade, Casillas will also pass Walter Zenga’s 1990 record of 517 minutes unbeaten. Algeria seek to avoid a place in history rather than grab one. Failure to score against Belgium in Belo Horizonte would render them the first country to go six successive World Cup games without a goal. At the other end of the glamour scale, Jürgen Klinsmann (the US coach) and Didier Deschamps (France) endeavour to join Brazil’s Mario Zagallo and Germany’s Franz Beckenbauer as the only men to have won World Cups as a player and a manager. Only Vittori Pozzo has won two trophies as a coach (with Italy in 1934 and 1938). Scolari or Del Bosque could take equal rank in the final in Rio de Janeiro on July 13. Despite all their talent and player development system, Germany have not won a trophy since Euro 96 in England. They were runners-up at Euro 2008 and third in the 2006 and 2010 World Cups. At Euro 2012 they were undone by Italy and Mario Balotelli in a game that was seen by many as a near-formality for the Nationalmannschaft. Five days before their game with Portugal in Salvador, Germany were embroiled in a row with 11 locals in the Santo Andre community over excessive security near their base. “We had wanted to ride by bike to our training ground everyday, but unfortunately this is not possible, because the police don’t allow it,” Oliver Bierhoff, Germany’s team manager, complained. The numbers say that in World Cup history 76 teams have played 772 games involving 6,598 players in 19 runnings of the event. This 20th staging lifts Brazil out of the sepia of 1950 and asks huge questions of the country’s infrastructure, government, economy and treatment of its own people, who have plenty of justifications for their grievances. Fifa announced on the eve of the opening ceremony that its 209 national member associations and six regional confederations will be paid bonuses totalling $200 million (£119 million) as revenue projections for Brazil 2014 shot up from $3.8 billion (£2.3 billion) to $4.5 billion (£2.7 billion). These hands‑outs are 40 per cent higher than in South Africa four years ago. Lord Triesman, the former Football Association chairman, alleged: “Fifa, I’m afraid, behaves like a mafia family. It has a decades-long tradition of bribes, bungs and corruption.” Brazil’s president Dilma Rousseff, tortured by the military junta in the early 1970s, portrayed her country as one striving for greater fairness. “I’m certain visitors will mix with a happy, generous and hospitable people, and be impressed by a nation full of natural beauty and which fights each day to become more equal,” she said. There are other kinds of fighting, too. In the first reported case of fan-on-fan violence, an Argentine supporter’s finger was broken when three Brazilians tried to rip a flag from his hands in Belo Horizonte. At a dream final of Argentina v Brazil just over four weeks from now, the chap with the broken finger can gain his revenge, especially if Messi can become the king of his continent ahead of Neymar. - Wayne Rooney: This time I have no excuses for failing to perform - Alan Hansen: Brazil were the best team I faced - I bared had a kick - Manaus groundsman: Pitch for England's game is in poor shape	sports
Manuel Neuer fit for Germany's World Cup opener with Portugal - Goal.com	The Bayern Munich shot stopper has been struggling with a shoulder injury but the goalkeeper coach insists he is fully fit to feature on Monday Manuel Neuer will be fit for Germany's World Cup opener with Portugal, according to goalkeeper coach Andreas Kopke. The Bayern Munich keeper has been struggling with a shoulder injury in recent weeks, but Kopke has allayed any fears that he will miss their Group G fixture on Monday, June 16. "Manuel's going to train fully today so that he can get a feel for his shoulder," Kopke said. "Things are going in the right direction for him. Manuel is experienced enough and we're constantly discussing how his shoulder feels. "It's not the case that he doesn't have faith in it. Manuel is fully fit." Neuer's understudy Roman Weidenfeller played in Germany's last two warm-up games - a 2-2 draw with Cameron and a 6-1 thrashing of Armenia - and Kopke insists there is no problem between the two keepers as they battle it out for the number one jersey. "You've got to have a great team spirit," he said. "Roman has said himself that there is no point in arguing about who should be number one. "He would be ready to play at any time, but he knows the overall situation. The players are pushing each other to greater things with their performances."	sports

With the greatest respect to Bryan, Trevor, Bob and Duncan from BDO [Hearts’ administrators], we are all delighted to see them go! “On a serious note, however, we owe them a huge thank-you for putting in the hours to get us out of administration this week, as promised. “So what now?

Should Hibs move for Murray they will have to pay Dumbarton – whom he steered to fifth place in last season’s Championship, despite sparse resources – compensation for the two-year deal he agreed in May. Murray, who took over in 2012 and led Dumbarton to seventh place the following season, was linked with the St Mirren vacancy when Danny Lennon was sacked, but the Paisley board had already decided to appoint Lennon’s assistant, Tommy Craig. When he signed his new deal with Dumbarton, Murray said: “I’m glad everything’s been sorted and we can get into the planning process for an exciting campaign next season.” However, with two spells as a Hibs player on his CV, it was inevitable that Murray’s name would be touted as a possible successor to Butcher, and one that would be popular with many fans.	sports
Italy playmaker Andrea Pirlo confident ahead of England World Cup 2014 clash - Telegraph	It is little wonder, then, that there is talk of Hodgson specifically adapting his formation to deal with the unique threat of a playmaker who operates so far behind the main striker. Pirlo is confident that the Italian midfield will simply use their movement to ensure that any man-marking strategy would be doomed to failure. Italy tested out a 4-1-3-1-1 formation during their training session on Wednesday and have been constantly tweaking their system during the build-up matches. Daniele De Rossi and Marco Verratti are expected to start but the one certainty is that manager Cesare Prandelli will give Pirlo the freedom to influence the game however he sees fit. “We tried this new solution with a midfielder in front of the defence and two further forward with more freedom,” said Pirlo. “We aim to rotate the midfield positions to keep our opponents guessing. "We like this option, it can give great results and we are working to improve every day. We can try many different approaches but it is also down to how you interpret the role. In truth it’s a system that involves rotation, as we go forward and at other times I’d come back into the more classic position.” Italy’s form in the warm-up matches will have prompted few alarm bells with England. True, they found their goalscoring touch in dispatching Fluminense 5-3 on Sunday but were winless in six previously during a sequence that even included an embarrassing 1-1 draw with Luxembourg. Pirlo was part of the Italy team that won the 2006 World Cup and he is still adamant that a repeat is possible. He also dismissed questions about his own elite status and the suggestion that Italy had become dependent upon him. “I was never interested in being a world star,” he said. “I think about enjoying - you journalists make the world stars. No. We are 23 players at the disposal of the coach and know to go all the way we need a contribution from everyone, as we learned in 2006. “Can Italy win the World Cup? Of course. When I play, it is solely to win. I am never just content with getting through the round. We have a competitive squad and will give our all to achieve this objective. We have the chance to make this a World Cup to be remembered for all our lives. We have what it takes to go far. The important thing is to believe, sacrifice ourselves, work hard and the results can arrive.” That process begins on Saturday, with Pirlo hinting that he could yet renege on a previous plan to retire from international football after this World Cup. At 35, his hunger to keep playing in club football was underlined on Wednesday by confirmation of a new two-year contract at Juventus. “I intend to quit international football after this World Cup but if I am needed...” said Pirlo. “I am still thinking of retiring, as I have a certain age and it’s only right to leave the field to the next generation coming through. It would be pointless to continue. “If I am needed, then there’s no problem in coming back. But if I come on international duty and don’t play, then I’d get angry. So it’s perhaps better I stay home.” It was a mercurial answer but typical of the one player who adds fantasy to an Italy team that still lack a certain flair. In his recent autobiography, Pirlo made a point of acknowledging how Juninho Pernambucano had inspired his free-kick technique and the former Brazil midfielder was even a guest on Wednesday at Casa Azzurri. “Pirlo is a demon, he not only copied my shot but improved it - if I was still playing I’d ask him to teach me,” said Juninho. Pirlo digested the compliment, gratefully accepted a Brazil shirt with his name on it and then delivered an even better sound-bite of his own. “Juninho was very kind to me, we were both emotional,” he said. “I’m Italian, but I’m also part Brazilian - Pirlinho, if you like.”	sports

Safet Susic's side go up against the South American giants in their opening match of Group F at the nation's first ever World Cup.  And despite the prospect of facing the likes of Lionel Messi and Sergio Aguero, playmaker Pjanic is confident that his country can give Argentina a run for their money. "We will be against one of the favourites in Argentina, but we have the expertise to challenge them," he told Sky Sport 24 . "We do not fear anyone because we believe in our chances.

World Cup 2014: Prepare for joyous, nerve-shredding, ludicrous drama as Brazil's carnival begins - Telegraph	This is a World Cup that cannot shimmy around the problems of Brazilian life and society but still strives for what Socrates called “the ludicrous and joyous” drama of football between nations, watched by the world, in a narrative as broad and strong as the Amazon, which England will fly along to face Italy in Manaus on Saturday. Brazil are threatened on all sides by rich European countries who plunder their best players as well as their old enemy to the south, Argentina, plus the former colonial master – Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal. Ronaldo showed no sign of injury in Portugal’s 5-1 friendly win over the Republic of Ireland, and is now said to be billeted in a VIP suite where he can contemplate his private battle against Lionel Messi, whose vomiting problem has been the source of much curiosity. Messi, now 26, doubled-up again shortly after coming on in Argentina’s last warm-up match and has thrown-up half a dozen times for club and country. “Nerves,” says Argentina’s coach Alejandro Sabella, whose forward line is the most potent at this World Cup. “I reckon that in these moments there is anxiety more than anything. It’s difficult to remain calm.” The Ronaldo-Messi struggle for supremacy was not meant to be described in such malodorous terms, but at least Messi’s nausea tells us that today’s one-man corporations still care about their work. Neymar, who now wears the sacred No 10 for Brazil, has these two to cope with on top of his country’s expectations. Wayne Rooney, who was once compared to Pele by Sven-Goran Eriksson in one of his giddier moments, is another with a sword of judgment poised over his head. In two World Cups, Messi has scored only once, in a 6-0 win over Serbia in 2006, and the heat is on him to convert brilliance at Barcelona into something resembling Diego Maradona’s majesty with Argentina. He is not without accomplices in this cross-border raid. Across the forward line Sabella can call on Gonzalo Higuaín, Sergio Agüero, Ezequiel Lavezzi and Ángel Di Maria, none of which is good news for Bosnia (the debutants), Iran or Nigeria, who make up Group F. These are not the only A-list strikers, but some are struggling for fitness as their opening games approach. Uruguay’s Luis Suárez and Spain’s Diego Costa are among those walking the fine line between recovery and further breakdown. Suárez, the Premier League’s player of the year, underwent arthroscopic surgery on May 22 and trained on his own on Tuesday. Costa, from Lagarto in Brazil, was granted Spanish citizenship last year and could be in for a lively reception from the home crowds. The day before England play Italy on a pitch that looks in photographs like a jungle landing strip, the world and European champions Spain stage a rematch of the 2010 'karate’ final in Johannesburg, which Spain won at the expense of Holland, managed by Manchester United’s autocrat in waiting, Louis van Gaal. Spain hunt a double double. They captured the 2008 and 2012 European Championships either side of their World Cup victory in South Africa, from which 16 members of the squad survive. Spain are foremost among those teams hoping to overturn the reality that all South American World Cups have been won by South American teams. Spain’s dominance of world football can be seen as a victory over the Brazilian talent production machine, to the extent that Scolari’s men all spoke of a huge psychological boost with their Confederations Cup win over Vicente del Bosque’s team here last summer. Even Pele’s country had fallen prey to the notion of Spanish invincibility. Now this tournament offers a chance to restore their No 1 position after a six-year pageant of tiki‑taka-based play. This opening fixture is a chance to take almost sadistic pleasure in the sight of 23 footballers in the beautiful buttercup shirts of their land carry the hopes of 200 million Brazilians, with Neymar the dream catcher in chief. Carlos Alberto Parreira, coach of the 1994‑winning team in America, told reporters that the 22-year-old Neymar’s status as Brazil’s to craque (star) has piled pressure on the team’s poster boy. “A craque can make a difference from one move to another, but it’s the team that wins,” said Parreira, who is now Brazil’s technical director. “Like Maradona, Romario, Pele and all the players who made stand-out World Cup performances, he’ll win with a team behind him.” No host team meanwhile have ever lost an opening match. Brazil lift the World Cup curtain for the first time since their 2-1 win over Scotland at the Stade de France in 1998 and are closing in on La Hexa (a sixth win), two years before the 2016 Olympics drop another spaceship on the Brazilian economy, already reeling from the likely $12 billion cost of staging this event. This week the Brazilian business magazine Isto E Dinheiro called Scolari the “chief executive of the sixth world title”, as if this World Cup were a commercial takeover rather than a hard-fought competition. Before the ball rolls off the centre circle at the mostly-finished stadium in Sao Paulo, Brazil is trapped between the old sense of entitlement and a blazing urge to reject Fifa and its own government’s extravagance. “This is the strangest atmosphere I’ve ever witnessed in Brazil before a World Cup, as apprehension and apathy threaten the normal excitement,” the historian Antonio Risério told The New York Times, who also reported that only 34 per cent of Brazilians think the economy will be improved by the four-week party. Arnaldo Bloch, a columnist with O Globo, wrote: “That talk about the national team being the patrimony of Brazil, the affirmation of our identity and civility and cordiality – no one swallows that anymore.” But football is an opiate that usually finds a route round the body. As the marvellous Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano observed of the old culture: “Brazil has the most beautiful game in the world, made of hip feints, undulations of the torso and legs in flight, all of which came from capoeira, the warrior dance of black slaves, and from the joyful dances of big city slums. There are no right angles in Brazilian football, just as there are none in the Rio mountains.” Who will not look for surviving evidence of this culture when Thiago Silva leads the hosts up the tunnel here in Sao Paulo? However England fare against Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica, English viewers will have little difficulty identifying with Scolari’s outfit. A former Chelsea manager himself, he summoned six Premier League players, as well as Julio Cesar, the goalkeeper recently at Queens Park Rangers. David Luiz, Oscar, Ramires and Willian from Chelsea join Manchester City’s Fernandinho and Paulinho of Spurs in Brazil’s 23-man home guard. This pattern is repeated across the tournament, where 110 Premier League players will represent 26 of the 32 countries. Only Burnley and West Ham United from England’s top flight are without a single player in Brazil. Chelsea lead the way with 17. Beaten in the last World Cup quarter-finals by France (2006) and Holland (2010), Brazil seek their first win since 2002 in Yokohama, when the three Rs of Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho overwhelmed a Germany side now under intense pressure to convert promise into hard metal. Ronaldo’s goalscoring record is under threat from Germany’s Miroslav Klose, a functional finisher by comparison, who needs one more to match the Brazilian Ronaldo’s 15. Others edge towards landmarks. Span’s Iker Casillas has kept seven clean sheets in 15 World Cup finals matches and is three shy of the record of 10 held by Peter Shilton and Fabien Barthez. With one more blockade, Casillas will also pass Walter Zenga’s 1990 record of 517 minutes unbeaten. Algeria seek to avoid a place in history rather than grab one. Failure to score against Belgium in Belo Horizonte would render them the first country to go six successive World Cup games without a goal. At the other end of the glamour scale, Jürgen Klinsmann (the US coach) and Didier Deschamps (France) endeavour to join Brazil’s Mario Zagallo and Germany’s Franz Beckenbauer as the only men to have won World Cups as a player and a manager. Only Vittori Pozzo has won two trophies as a coach (with Italy in 1934 and 1938). Scolari or Del Bosque could take equal rank in the final in Rio de Janeiro on July 13. Despite all their talent and player development system, Germany have not won a trophy since Euro 96 in England. They were runners-up at Euro 2008 and third in the 2006 and 2010 World Cups. At Euro 2012 they were undone by Italy and Mario Balotelli in a game that was seen by many as a near-formality for the Nationalmannschaft. Five days before their game with Portugal in Salvador, Germany were embroiled in a row with 11 locals in the Santo Andre community over excessive security near their base. “We had wanted to ride by bike to our training ground everyday, but unfortunately this is not possible, because the police don’t allow it,” Oliver Bierhoff, Germany’s team manager, complained. The numbers say that in World Cup history 76 teams have played 772 games involving 6,598 players in 19 runnings of the event. This 20th staging lifts Brazil out of the sepia of 1950 and asks huge questions of the country’s infrastructure, government, economy and treatment of its own people, who have plenty of justifications for their grievances. Fifa announced on the eve of the opening ceremony that its 209 national member associations and six regional confederations will be paid bonuses totalling $200 million (£119 million) as revenue projections for Brazil 2014 shot up from $3.8 billion (£2.3 billion) to $4.5 billion (£2.7 billion). These hands‑outs are 40 per cent higher than in South Africa four years ago. Lord Triesman, the former Football Association chairman, alleged: “Fifa, I’m afraid, behaves like a mafia family. It has a decades-long tradition of bribes, bungs and corruption.” Brazil’s president Dilma Rousseff, tortured by the military junta in the early 1970s, portrayed her country as one striving for greater fairness. “I’m certain visitors will mix with a happy, generous and hospitable people, and be impressed by a nation full of natural beauty and which fights each day to become more equal,” she said. There are other kinds of fighting, too. In the first reported case of fan-on-fan violence, an Argentine supporter’s finger was broken when three Brazilians tried to rip a flag from his hands in Belo Horizonte. At a dream final of Argentina v Brazil just over four weeks from now, the chap with the broken finger can gain his revenge, especially if Messi can become the king of his continent ahead of Neymar. - Wayne Rooney: This time I have no excuses for failing to perform - Alan Hansen: Brazil were the best team I faced - I bared had a kick - Manaus groundsman: Pitch for England's game is in poor shape	sports
VIDEO: Blatter dances his troubles away - Goal.com	Despite being faced with calls for him to resign, the 78-year-old Swiss took the time to show he still has authority on the dance floor alongside Fernanda Lima The build-up to the 2014 World Cup has been tough for Sepp Blatter, with allegations of corruption rocking Fifa and calls for the Swiss official to stand down amidst concerns over whether Brazil will even be ready for the opening fixtures of the tournament this week. When faced by the media just one day before the competition, however, the 78-year-old seemed decidedly unperturbed, taking time out of his schedule of handing out awards to showcase his dance moves with Brazilian beauty Fernanda Lima. Having also spoken of his desire to see football played in an "inter-platenary competition" in future, Blatter's moves in Brazil were hardly out of this world, but it certainly proved he is willing to embrace the part atmosphere of football's greatest showpiece...	sports
Spain v Holland: We want revenge against Spain, says Wesley Sneijder - Telegraph	“It felt very sour. That will always be my rock bottom. “We were so close to penalties and that game was still there, but Iniesta scored just three minutes before the end of the extra time. “It was a shame because we had beaten Brazil in the quarter-final, a night when we turned the whole game. “I scored twice. Two goals, one with my head, and a 1-0 deficit turned into a place in the semi-finals. “You just felt at one point that we were going to win. And then the final against Spain just went wrong.” Spain go into Friday’s fixture as favourites, with Van Gaal’s blend of experience and emerging youngsters expected to face a battle with Chile for the runners-up spot - and a potential second round clash with Brazil. Sneijder insists, however, that Holland can get the positive result they need against Spain to avoid a losing start to the tournament. “This is a big week but it's only one game,” Sneijder said. “We need a result against Spain. That’s the point. “We may not have a top team, but we definitely have a chance to fight hard and we play compact and can switch the ball quickly. We have a chance.” With Guus Hiddink due to replace Manchester United-bound Van Gaal as coach following theWorld Cup, the Dutch team is expected to be rebuilt ahead of Euro 2016 in France. But Sneijder insists he is ready to prove in Brazil his ability to extend his international career to the next World Cup in Russia in 2018. “I’m very proud of my international career,” Sneijder said. “I’m not a captain, but still a leader. “The team spirit is good, much better than two years ago (at Euro 2012) and I will do everything to keep it that way because that is important at a major tournament. I know that from experience. “These are my sixth major finals but I will keep going. You will see me in four years.” Dutch winger Arjen Robben, whose training ground clash with defender Bruno Martins Indi earlier this week hinted at tensions within the squad, echoed Sneijder’s claims that Holland will test Spain by backing Van Gaal’s youngsters to impress in Salvador. “We have a young team, but it is talented,” Robben told Fifa.com. “Experience is important, especially mentally. But on the pitch it is all about playing in the right way, doing what you have to do - and it doesn’t matter if you are 22 or 32. You just have to do what is asked for. “That said, in my opinion Brazil, Argentina, Spain and Germany are the favourites. It will be hard for us because we have to play a very tough group. “Spain are the reigning world and European champions, and two teams from Spain played this season’s Champions League final. That says it all. “Chile also have a very strong team with really good players who want to play in an attacking way. “And Australia are physically strong. We have played a few matches against them and were never able to win. “But our preparations have been going well so far and I’m really happy we are in Brazil now. You can feel the tournament is about to start. “Brazil is one of the greatest football countries in the world - maybe the greatest - so it is fantastic the World Cup has been organised here.”	sports
Hearts euphoric as club finally exit administration a year after insolvency - Telegraph	Local businesswoman, Ann Budge, who agreed a deal with creditors to buy the club and install Craig Levein as director of football and Robbie Neilson as head coach, used the Hearts website to address the support in excited terms, when she said: “By now, you will all have heard and, yes, it’s true, we have formally exited administration! “Everyone associated with the club is ecstatic and now we can really begin to move ahead in implementing our plans for the future. With the greatest respect to Bryan, Trevor, Bob and Duncan from BDO [Hearts’ administrators], we are all delighted to see them go! “On a serious note, however, we owe them a huge thank-you for putting in the hours to get us out of administration this week, as promised. “So what now? Well, the first thing is to get season tickets on sale as quickly as possible and the club will be issuing information regarding this tomorrow. “Following this, we will shortly be issuing information on new signings and more pre-season friendlies which, I know, is what all the fans are desperate to hear. “However, for today, let’s just celebrate the news!” Meanwhile, at Easter Road, the hunt for a replacement for Butcher has started, with Ian Murray favourite to get the job, despite speculation that the new Hibernian CEO, Leeann Dempster, would turn to Motherwell, the club she left to move to Edinburgh, in pursuit of Stuart McCall. Should Hibs move for Murray they will have to pay Dumbarton – whom he steered to fifth place in last season’s Championship, despite sparse resources – compensation for the two-year deal he agreed in May. Murray, who took over in 2012 and led Dumbarton to seventh place the following season, was linked with the St Mirren vacancy when Danny Lennon was sacked, but the Paisley board had already decided to appoint Lennon’s assistant, Tommy Craig. When he signed his new deal with Dumbarton, Murray said: “I’m glad everything’s been sorted and we can get into the planning process for an exciting campaign next season.” However, with two spells as a Hibs player on his CV, it was inevitable that Murray’s name would be touted as a possible successor to Butcher, and one that would be popular with many fans.	sports

Phil Jones feared for England World Cup place - Goal.com	The England defender took a heavy knock during Manchester United's 3-1 win over Hull in May but was included in Roy Hodgson's squad and is set to play in Brazil England defender Phil Jones has revealed that he feared for his World Cup prospects after injuring a shoulder at the end of last season. The 22-year-old sustained the injury in Manchester United's 3-1 win over Hull City last month, and it was initially feared he could be ruled out of the Brazilian showpiece. However, England boss Roy Hodgson included Jones in his 23-man squad and he played in the pre-tournament friendly against Ecuador last week. And the former Blackburn Rovers man has revealed he breathed a huge sigh of relief when he realised the injury was not going to prevent him from travelling to Brazil. "Once I did it (injured his shoulder) I thought I might not have a chance, but thankfully it healed quickly and I'm feeling fit, ready and I'm so looking forward to it," Jones told the FA's official website. "(The World Cup) was the first thing that came into my mind when I did it. "I remember getting the scan sitting there thinking 'it might knock my chance'. But, thankfully it's healed nicely and I'm able to be a part of what's going to hopefully be a successful tournament." Jones partnered club-mate Chris Smalling at the heart of England's defence in the 2-2 draw with Ecuador, and he was thrilled to get back on the pitch after a month out. "It was nice to get a start, it was a great game, competitive, it was what we wanted and it was great getting 90 minutes under my belt," he added. "It's been great, the lads were all really keen and excited to get out here and now we're here there's a real belief and buzz about the place. "It's building up to the first crucial game of the tournament. There has been an awful lot of work that has gone in behind the scenes which most people don't see. "Everyone is committed, we're in a tight group and everyone's pulling in the right direction for a successful campaign over here."	sports

Chelsea youngster Tomas Kalas joins Koln on loan - Goal.com	The Czech defender made two Premier League appearances for the Blues in 2013-14 but will continue his development at the newly-promoted Bundesliga club Chelsea defender Tomas Kalas will join newly promoted FC Koln on a season-long loan on July 1. The Czech, who has a solitary international cap to his name, spent two seasons on loan at Dutch outfit Vitesse Arnhem before returning to Stamford Bridge for the 2013-14 campaign. After being handed his Chelsea debut as a late substitute in a 2-0 League Cup win at Arsenal in October, Kalas made his European bow in a last-16 home triumph over Galatasaray. Kalas' first start for the club came in the huge 2-0 Premier League victory at Liverpool in April, and he was among the starting XI once again on the last day of the Premier League season at relegated Cardiff City.

Phil Jones feared for England World Cup place - Goal.com	The England defender took a heavy knock during Manchester United's 3-1 win over Hull in May but was included in Roy Hodgson's squad and is set to play in Brazil England defender Phil Jones has revealed that he feared for his World Cup prospects after injuring a shoulder at the end of last season. The 22-year-old sustained the injury in Manchester United's 3-1 win over Hull City last month, and it was initially feared he could be ruled out of the Brazilian showpiece. However, England boss Roy Hodgson included Jones in his 23-man squad and he played in the pre-tournament friendly against Ecuador last week. And the former Blackburn Rovers man has revealed he breathed a huge sigh of relief when he realised the injury was not going to prevent him from travelling to Brazil. "Once I did it (injured his shoulder) I thought I might not have a chance, but thankfully it healed quickly and I'm feeling fit, ready and I'm so looking forward to it," Jones told the FA's official website. "(The World Cup) was the first thing that came into my mind when I did it. "I remember getting the scan sitting there thinking 'it might knock my chance'. But, thankfully it's healed nicely and I'm able to be a part of what's going to hopefully be a successful tournament." Jones partnered club-mate Chris Smalling at the heart of England's defence in the 2-2 draw with Ecuador, and he was thrilled to get back on the pitch after a month out. "It was nice to get a start, it was a great game, competitive, it was what we wanted and it was great getting 90 minutes under my belt," he added. "It's been great, the lads were all really keen and excited to get out here and now we're here there's a real belief and buzz about the place. "It's building up to the first crucial game of the tournament. There has been an awful lot of work that has gone in behind the scenes which most people don't see. "Everyone is committed, we're in a tight group and everyone's pulling in the right direction for a successful campaign over here."	sports

David Luiz reveals five-year deal with PSG - Goal.com	The 27-year-old claims he has agreed to leave Chelsea and play for the French champions for five seasons following this month's World Cup in Brazil Brazil defender David Luiz has revealed he has signed a five-year deal with French champions Paris Saint-Germain. His current club, Chelsea, and PSG both released statements on their official websites last month confirming that a deal  - which Goal understands is worth €50 million - had been agreed. And now the 27-year-old, who is hoping to lead the Selecao to their sixth world title and their first on home soil, has confirmed he will be playing in Ligue 1 for the next five seasons. “I have just signed a deal with PSG for five years,” he told Globo when asked if he intends to one day play in Brazil’s top flight. “I left for Europe when I was 18, I skipped a few steps… We’ll see. What we plan today may not be right tomorrow.” The Selecao’s vice-captain also spoke of the demonstrations seen across the country in protest of public spending for the World Cup. “As long as the demonstrations happen peacefully, I respect them. I do not want to see violence,” he said. “I do not like the vision that Europeans have about our country, that Brazil is bad. Brazil has many things to be great.”	sports

Chelsea youngster Tomas Kalas joins Koln on loan - Goal.com	The Czech defender made two Premier League appearances for the Blues in 2013-14 but will continue his development at the newly-promoted Bundesliga club Chelsea defender Tomas Kalas will join newly promoted FC Koln on a season-long loan on July 1. The Czech, who has a solitary international cap to his name, spent two seasons on loan at Dutch outfit Vitesse Arnhem before returning to Stamford Bridge for the 2013-14 campaign. After being handed his Chelsea debut as a late substitute in a 2-0 League Cup win at Arsenal in October, Kalas made his European bow in a last-16 home triumph over Galatasaray. Kalas' first start for the club came in the huge 2-0 Premier League victory at Liverpool in April, and he was among the starting XI once again on the last day of the Premier League season at relegated Cardiff City. The 21-year-old will now be hoping to pick up more first-team experience as Koln adjust to life back in the Bundesliga, after topping the second tier last term. Kalas arrived at Chelsea from Sigma Olomouc in 2011.	sports

Fifa behaves like mafia family, says Lord Triesman - Goal.com	The former English Football Association chairman has compared the organisation's beleaguered leadership to the Corleone crime family depicted in the Godfather films Fifa behaves like a "mafia family" with a tradition of "bribes, bungs and corruption", according to former English Football Association chairman Lord Triesman. World football's governing body has been rocked by a series of scandals in recent years, most recently allegations published by The Sunday Times newspaper relating to impropriety in Qatar's successful bid to host the 2022 World Cup. Fifa's bullish response to the allegations has led several high-ranking Uefa delegates to call for president Sepp Blatter to step down after 16 years at the head of the organisation. And Triesman, who was FA chairman when England launched its failed bid to host the 2018 World Cup, has launched a scathing public attack on the Fifa leadership, likening it to the Corleone crime family depicted in the Godfather films. "Fifa, I’m afraid, behaves like a mafia family. It has a decades-long tradition of bribes, bungs and corruption," he said during a debate on the Queen's Speech in the House of Lords. "About half of its executive committee who voted on the last World Cup have had to go. "Even its past president Joao Havelange has been removed from his honorary life presidency in his 90s. "Systematic corruption underpinned by non-existent investigations where most of the accused are exempt from the investigation make it impossible to proceed. "Don Corleone, I believe, would have recognised the tactics and he probably would have admired them."	sports

Ghana face anxious wait on injured Abdul Majeed Waris - Goal.com	The striker suffered a torn thigh muscle in the friendly win over South Korea and is a doubt for the World Cup opener against USA on Monday Scans have revealed that Ghana striker Abdul Majeed Waris has a torn quadricep and faces a race against time to be fit for the World Cup. The injury was at first thought to be relatively minor, incurred during the fourth minute of Monday's 4-0 friendly victory over South Korea. "He had a knock on his left thigh," said team doctor Baba Adam. "We initially tried to see if he could go back to play but we realised it was an injury that needed to be taken care of and managed well. "We did an MRI on the quadriceps and what we realised is that, there was a tear. "We hope to get him on to the field again pretty soon. However, we are still monitoring him to the deadline when we will give our final statement on his state of affairs." Waris' absence would be a huge blow after the diminutive attacker played an integral part in Ghana's qualification for Brazil, during which he scored three goals. "The Fifa deadline is (June) 15, so we will monitor until that day and see how things turn up," said Adam before adding that Waris is improving and "can now bend his knee with little pain." Ghana begin their World Cup campaign against the United States on Monday before meeting Germany on June 21 and Portugal on June 26.	sports
Sepp Blatter: I want an interplanetary World Cup - Telegraph	Triesman, the initial chairman of England's doomed bid to host the 2018 World Cup, has previously claimed four Fifa members sought bribes in return for votes. In the light of recent media allegations of corruption in Qatar's successful bid for the 2022 World Cup, Triesman stepped up his attack on the governing body, claiming attempts by Blatter to dismiss the issue was a tactic that would have been approved by movie Godfather Don Corleone. "Fifa, I'm afraid, behaves like a mafia family. It has a decades-long tradition of bribes, bungs and corruption," he said. Speaking during a debate on the Queen's Speech in the House of Lords, Triesman applauded the stand taken by current FA chairman Greg Dyke against the "grotesque" accusation by Blatter that media investigations into corruption at Fifa were racist. He told peers: "Don Corleone, I believe, would have recognised the tactics and he probably would have admired them." Speaking on the eve of the World Cup in Brazil, Blatter also said Fifa must move forward in a changing world in which football had become a "multi-billion dollar" industry with "powerful opportunities".
