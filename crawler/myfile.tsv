Football365 - Football News, Views, Gossip and much more...	We cannot imagine this will go down incredibly well with Wayne Rooney but it looks like he will be on the left tonight against Ecuador. "He can do that (role), absolutely," said Hodgson, who also confirmed that Frank Lampard would captain the side and James Milner would start at right-back. "I think Wayne's a very useful player in the sense you don't have to pin him down and say this is the only position he can play." The debate continues...	sports

The Afternoon Gossip | Football Transfer Rumours and Gossip | Football365	Barca plan £56m move for Aguero, City close to securing £15m Fernando, Arsenal target Morata to join Juve, and... Last Updated: 03/06/14 at 16:32 Post Comment Latest Articles Chelsea in pole position for Fabregas, Spurs target three defensive recruits, Bony to cost Arsenal £19m and more... Adam Lallana needs to put in a transfer request to force through Reds move, Balotelli to Arsenal and Cesc to City... All the rumours from Tuesday morning are here... BARCELONA PLOT AGUERO BID It looks like Barcelona won't take 'no' for an answer in their chase for Sergio Aguero. According to the Daily Star, the Catalan club are preparing a bid of £56m for the striker, who is also attracting interest from Real Madrid. Aguero's father told COPE radio that his son prefers a move to Barcelona last week, but added that Manchester City are unlikely to let him leave. The Star report: 'New Barcelona manager Luis Enrique has made the 26-year-old his No.1 summer target. 'Cesc Fabregas and Alexis Sanchez are set to leave Barcelona during the close season and Enrique wants to use the funds raised through their sales to finance a deal for Aguero.' FERNANDO SET FOR CITY Manchester City are close to sealing a £15m move for Porto midfielder Fernando, report the Daily Mirror. The 26-year-old was tipped for a deadline-day switch to the Etihad in February, but the transfer fell through at the eleventh hour. A deal for Fernando has now been resurrected, though, with City also chasing his teammate Eliaquim Mangala. MORATA WANTS JUVE MOVE After months of speculation linking Alvaro Morata with a move to Arsenal, it seems the Real Madrid forward is now on his way to Juventus. The Daily Express claim that Real are planning to use the 21-year-old as bait in their bid to bring Arturo Vidal to the Santiago Bernabeu. Apparently Carlo Ancelotti sees Vidal as the perfect replacement for the ageing Xabi Alonso, and is willing to let Morata go to secure a transfer. STOKE CLOSING ON DIOUF Stoke are closing in on their second signing of the summer after already completing a deal for Sunderland's Phil Bardsley. The next target on Mark Hughes' wish list is former Manchester United striker Mame Biram Diouf, who was close to joining the Potters last summer. Diouf has caught Hughes' eye after scoring 33 goals in 68 games for Hannover over the past two seasons and it's thought a transfer is close to completion. "We're hopeful that Diouf will be done," Stoke chairman Peter Coates told the BBC. AND THE REST Roberto Martinez has revealed that he has already identified who he wants to sign this summer, and is now working on closing several deals...Arsenal face competition for Toulouse right-back Serge Aurier after his agent said the Ivorian is currently in talks with another English club...Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United are all tracking highly-rated MK Dons youngster Dele Alli...Aleksandar Kolarov has emerged as a target for Bayern Munich...Michael Laudrup is planning to return to management with a 'big club'...and finally, there is a tremendous piece of bulls**t doing the rounds that Manchester United want Luis Suarez for £65m. Inventive.	sports

We have lots of World Cup mails so thanks... There are only ten days to go before the biggest event of the football calendar and yet we're still having to publish emails about Arsene Wenger.

Despite cruising to a 3-0 win against Peru, England didn't show a great deal to support Matt Stanger's view that they'll get out of the group. He's waiting to judge Wayne Rooney... It's unlikley Peru will provide a similar test to Uruguay simply because they are from the same confederation, but the most important thing for England is to avoid costly injuries...

Ashley Cole showing a genuine emotion, Kallstrom's last match and Newcastle fans actually wanting their club to be run in an ethical manner. These are heady times indeed... It was a performance that encapsulated everything that Mourinho stands for and desires. On a sunny morning in Liverpool, Jose came, he saw and he ruined the party... It's easy to criticise Mike Dean for another catalogue of errors, but he should really be congratulated for such an impressive display of winding-up Rui Faria and Chelsea. Liverpool got the 'fear' at times on Sunday, but Vincent Kompany was there to allow the little kid to carry on sprinting. The sort of mistake that wins or loses a title race...	sports

The Page That Is Planning More Treats | Football365 | Mediawatch	Latest Articles 'Man reminds other men to sing (even though there's no indication they've forgotten)' is the headline on several back pages while Daniel Sturridge has been 'forcing' Roy Hodgson to play him... Which journo has claimed an exclusive on the Lambert story despite citing The Guardian elsewhere? And Robbie Savage thinks that Tim Sherwood is more magic than Harry Potter... Wrong, Wrong, Wrong Ian Wright has launced a staunch defence of Danny Welbeck in The Sun as he struggles to grasp why some fans don't want to see the forward in England's first XI. 'People are constantly having a pop at him but there's not a lot of foundation to that beyond the fact United had such a nightmare season,' writes Wright. 'Of course, he might miss a couple of chances here and there...' A couple of chances, Ian? Only 13 goals in 77 appearances for United over the last two seasons suggests he's missed a lot more than that. Of course, there's still a strong case for Welbeck to start for England, but what irks Mediawatch is Wright's refusal to acknowledge the debate is justified while simultaneously participating in said debate. 'In many ways it's just like bullying,' continues Wright on the 'head-scratching' opposition to Welbeck's inclusion. 'There's just no substance to it beyond the fact he plays for United - nothing more than that.' However, Wrighty then concedes: 'I can see why people want to see Sterling in there...' So which is it, Ian? An illogical view based purely on club tribalism, or just standard pre-World Cup discussion, which you're clearly happy to entertain despite insisting there is no debate to be had? Big Draw 'We are an Ecuadraw' boasts the headline in The Sun as they preview Wednesday's warm-up game. Writes Charlie Wyett: 'England are set to play in front of a 20,000-plus crowd against Ecuador in Miami tomorrow. 'An official at Sun Life Stadium - home to the Miami Dolphins - said: "We were hoping for up to 30,000. But it's not bad as the game will be played in working hours." 'The ageing stadium can hold up to 76,000 but large sections will be sealed off. Tickets start at £20.' So apart from anticipating an extra 10,000 fans, and having to seal off some 50,000 seats despite reasonable prices, it certainly looks like England are a big (Ecua)draw. Durham As seems to be the trend on Tuesday, Adrian Durham sticks up for his England favourite on the MailOnline, insisting that Wayne Rooney is still the best player available to Roy Hodgson. His entire premise is detailed in four bullet points at the top of the page - which the Mail now attach to every article for those who can't be bothered to read - but Mediawatch still scrolled to the very bottom so you don't have to. 'When I read Mick Channon describing Rooney as the 'weak link' on Sportsmail last week I was shocked,' writes Durham. 'The former Manchester City and Southampton striker is right that Rooney hasn't delivered at a World Cup, but he's only the weak link if he offers less than the rest. 'Rooney doesn't deserve the criticism. He has earned the right with performances and goals for his club and country for us all to debate how to get the best out of him, rather than lazily writing him off.' How very noble. You can say what you like about Adrian Durham - and Mediawatch has said it all - but if there's one thing you'll never catch him doing it's lazily writing someone off. He'd never...oh, what's that? From July 2013: 'You're Carlo Ancelotti. You're deciding who would be the better signing - Wayne Rooney or Luis Suarez. It's a no-brainer. Rooney is miles ahead. 'In fact I wonder how good Luis Suarez actually is. He's got quality and ability - probably more than most. But looking good in the Dutch league and standing out in one of the most average Liverpool sides I've seen in my lifetime does not constitute a top-level player.' Ah, just when we thought we could be friends. Friends Headline on the MailOnline (we'll let you guess who penned the article): 'Chelsea would have won more friends if model pro Frank Lampard had been captain rather than tarnished John Terry.' Yes, because that's what competitive sport is about. And Finally... 'How dare Southampton hold Adam Lallana back?' Oh God, no more Durham. Ever. Please. Like Rain On Your Wedding Day Writes Dave Kidd in the Daily Mirror: 'There's a certain irony in the fact that Spurs have told Mauricio Pochettino he must speak English in press conferences, having sacked Tim Sherwood for speaking too much plain English in press conferences.' Two things: 1) Tim Sherwood wasn't sacked for 'speaking too much plain English'. He was sacked owing to a dreadful record against Spurs' top-four rivals and because he was accused of having lost the players' confidence. 2) That isn't ironic. Exclusively Bulls**t '16 CLUBS CHASE FRANK', booms the 'WORLD EXCLUSIVE' on the back page of The Sun, with scribe Andrew Dillon writing: 'Frank Lampard is the world's most wanted player with 16 clubs chasing him.' Wow, 16 clubs. We'd love to know who they are, and surely The Sun are prepared to divulge that information given that it's a 'WORLD EXCLUSIVE'. Otherwise, isn't this just another story saying Lampard has options? 'Italians Fiorentina and clubs in Qatar and Brazil have added their names to the long list of teams who want to land him,' Dillon continues. 'LA Galaxy have re-emerged as contenders as well, along with the MLS' newest franchise New York City. 'And, as SunSport exclusively revealed last week, Lamps' uncle, QPR boss Harry Redknapp, is desperate to lure the Blues legend after winning promotion to the top flight.' Mediawatch makes that four clubs The Sun have named in their 'WORLD EXCLUSIVE'. There must be an awful lot of teams in Qatar and Brazil. West West End Report the Daily Mirror: 'Spurs midfielder Paulinho has reacted to Chelsea dropping their interest in him by insisting he never wanted to quit White Hart Lane. 'The Brazilian World Cup star, who made it clear he wanted out of the club after a spell on the bench under Tim Sherwood, said: "I never considered returning to Brazil. It never crossed my mind."' He knows Chelsea are based just down the road, right? One To Keep Your Eye On 'Sergio Aguero is going nowhere this summer - after Manchester City ruled out a sale' - The Sun. 'Manchester City will not sell Sergio Aguero - even for a world-record fee' - the Daily Mirror. Mediawatch couldn't be more certain that's the last we'll hear of Aguero's links to Real Madrid... Joyful Father-To-Be Of The Day Said Philippe Senderos on the birth of his child: "I can only pray that the baby arrives once I am home from Brazil." Good to know he's got his priorities straight.

The 26-year-old phone user was text messaging his partner for a number of hours while in bed. 'But his excessive messaging led to him suffering from sudden flashes in his eyesight.

A Sterling Stick To Use On Hodgson... | F365 Says	It's very, very easy to write a column saying that the latest Bright Young Thing should start for England...but thankfully England have a manager and not an X Factor-style vote... Last Updated: 03/06/14 at 16:00 Post Comment Latest Articles ...that makes Rickie Lambert a good fit at Liverpool, says Adam Bate. He clearly does offer a Plan B but he's good enough to fit in with the Plan A too. It's sound... Roy Hodgson is saddened by England's obsession with Wayne Rooney, but what does he expect? The debate over the striker's inclusion is now more relevant than ever... In March, the Daily Mail's Martin Samuel - never a man shy to state his case against all manner of straw men and 'mistakes' yet to be made - decried the lack of wingers in the England World Cup squad that would not be named for another two months. He screamed for more 'crackerjack wide players', for Raheem Sterling, Andros Townsend, Adam Lallana, Adam Johnson and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to be on the plane to Brazil. 'One minute we bemoan the lack of talent, the next we haven't got room for it all. Make your minds up, gentlemen,' he wrote. We're unsure which anonymous 'gentlemen' he was addressing but presumably he's fuming that Johnson - rather good for five minutes at the turn of the year - was left behind. He should be pleased that Sterling, Lallana and Oxlade-Chamberlain did make the final 23-man squad but instead he's angry again... 'Raheem Sterling needs to start, Roy...England have a long-standing mistrust of talent that needs to end in Brazil,' was the headline on Monday's column, which fumes at the fact that the useful but uninspiring James Milner was brought on ahead of Sterling against Peru on Friday night. That will be Milner (45 caps) brought on ahead of Sterling (two caps) - a point Samuel uses to illustrate England's innate distrust of fancy players, via a whistlestop tour of Matt Le Tissier, Alan Hudson, Rodney Marsh, Stan Bowles, Tony Currie and Peter Osgood. What Samuel - and anyone else clamouring for the very talented but ultimately inexperienced Sterling to leapfrog Milner and Danny Welbeck - fails to recognise is that the Liverpool winger is just 19 and has already been fast-tracked into the senior set-up. Milner and Welbeck were not England internationals at 19; the fact that Sterling is there at all is an acknowledgement that he has a talent that far outweighs his rivals. The question is not whether he will become a better player than either of those hard-working but limited players, but whether he is a better option right now in what would easily be the biggest game of his career against Italy in Manaus. It's incredibly easy to shout for the inclusion of an in-form player - especially when he plays for a club with a large and vociferous fanbase - and it's even easier when the alternatives appear to be so stodgy. There aren't many putting their hands up and pointing out that Welbeck had an incredibly similar strike rate to Sterling this season (nine goals from 45/46 shots) and was excellent against Bayern Munich in the Champions League, while Milner probably has even fewer people in his corner despite two Premier League titles in the last three seasons. Having been robbed of one 'conservative' beating stick by Hodgson's brave and balanced squad selection (conservative would have been to include Ashley Cole, Michael Carrick and Jermain Defoe), the next stick in hand is his reluctance to play the season's in-form XI, with no regard to performances in training, mental aptitude, experience or specific gameplans for specific opponents. Sod all that stuff, just play the kid who looks exciting - it's the easiest column to write as we approach a major tournament. Sterling will start against Ecuador on Wednesday, could well be ruddy marvellous, but still find himself on the bench against Honduras on Saturday and Italy a week later. Hands will be thrown up in the hair and we will wonder whether the same hands were thrown in the air 16 years ago when the precociously talented 18-year-old Michael Owen was left out of the starting line-up as England began their World Cup campaign in France. Two games and two lively substitute appearances later, Owen - now acclimatised to tournament football - came into the England side, along with the similarly untested David Beckham. The England manager that year was Glenn Hoddle, now regularly wheeled out as one of the great sages of the game and a potential saviour of English football. He saved Owen until he was sure he was ready, initially using his pace as an 'option off the bench', a phrase decried by Samuel this week. Hodgson may well decide to start Sterling against Italy - after all, he threw in the similarly youthful Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain two years ago - but should he choose the diligent Welbeck instead, it will be a decision based on rather more than 'who is the better player?' It's why we have a manager and don't choose the England team by public vote. Sarah Winterburn	sports

Amongst the many flaws of his system is the fact that I can't imagine any sane minded Real Madrid fan (for example) getting too excited if Aaron Lennon or Kyle Walker were linked to their club can you? Rob Pearse Cesc Never Won Owt In response to Conor (Honestly, I'm not carrying emotional baggage), Gooner, Dublin. First of all, I totally understand the romance of bringing Cesc back. I even think we could make room for him because, after all, he is a fantastic player. My issue is with the idea that bringing him back would represent the return of some kind of talisman who bought us through so many "bad times". The idea that bringing him back would somehow return us to our former glory. I'd just like to respectfully point out that we won absolutely nothing in the period that Cesc was our captain. It would be nice to heap some praise on those players who have put in the sort of performances that did finally break the drought. Mertesacker, Koscielny, Ramsey, Giroud - all players who came through bad times and now actually have something to show for it. Nothing wrong with a bit of romance but let's have it right, as good as Cesc was, we never saw him lift a trophy. Ben Smith - North Bank. Silly To Swap Ozil I would love nothing more than to have Cesc back in the side. Watching that goal against Tottenham again today reminded me of so many good times when he was at the club. However, swapping Ozil for Fabregas would be silly. Top of our assist charts, one of the biggest summer signings globally, our catalyst for last season and a trophy. Selling him and bringing in Cesc will look (not necessarily be) a step backwards ... So what are the other options? Adding without selling would mean we would be overloaded in midfield. Cazorla? Love him to bits and would hate to see him leave but he is 29 now and Cesc certainly wouldn't be a downgrade. Arteta? Not really a like for like replacement but I felt Arteta has been on the decline this season.. Still sometimes you do need someone to slow the pace of the game down Wilshire? Tricky one this. If Wilshire can get over his injuries he could be world class but he has been out-shined by Ramsey and will surely get less play time next season as a result...However, you do need a certain amount of English players in the Champs squad. And he is very good Ramsey? No I think ultimately no matter how much we love Cesc, I don't think there is a space for him in the squad anymore (i would argue that the only choice would be for Cazorla). It would hurt to see him play for a different english club but I would hope that he would "be injured" whenever he played us Rob (To be honest, I don't think Ozil looked like he enjoyed playing at Real that much either) AFC Anthems To Jae, Tunbridge Wells, who had a pop at "God Save the Queen," just be thankful that you're not from the USA. We've got an anthem that is virtually unsingable (and the tune was written by a man named John Smith, for crying out loud), and whose words are so convoluted that maybe 1 out of 10 Americans can tell you what they actually mean. Almost nobody likes it. I'd be very happy with "God Save the Queen," and in fact we already have it here, only with different words and titled "My Country 'Tis of Thee." But we stick with "The Star Spangled Banner," because...well, because. But what I'd really like is "Il Canto Degli Italiani," the Italian national anthem, an unabashed piece of militarism that's just flat-out fun, in a way that only the Italians can manage. PeterG, Pennsylavnia, USA Zing To add to the Non-English and where we stand on supporting England..... I am from Cardiff, the Capital City of Wales. Support nobody but Cardiff City and Wales but have lived and worked in London for about 5 years. I have just drawn England in my work sweepstake. .............however I do get £16 as a losing finalist! Rob Addressing A Few Points Conor, Dublin Gooner. Apart from not being sure how Man U are Arsenal's "ex best-mate" and how Chelsea are their "younger, richer, more successful neighbour", I didn't think we were allowed to do those "It's like when you're going out with/not going out with/meeting up with when too drunk to realise it's a stupid idea" analogies any more. I mean, it just isn't like that. It's like when a bloke who used to play for your football team went and played for another one. It most assuredly is nothing like having a real girlfriend who then, ah...I see. Moving on. Frank Lampard's "obscene goal output" is largely due to him taking about 150 penalties (guessed) over his career at Chelsea. Given just this, my goal output would be at least "creditable". I'm with you Chris MUFC. I'd have preferred it if we hadn't appealed Rooney's quite-deserved 3 game ban and not taken him to the last tournament. I thought we were doing better without him. Of course, we'll never know but I think we might well be better off now if he were just another 9 as opposed to the supposedly essential and yet clearly detrimental axis around which everything else must be shoe-horned into orbit. In which case, Tom London, I heartily disagree. He's not our "best player" (subjective yet stated as fact). He's been the "essential axis around which everything else must be shoe-horned into orbit" for ten years and considering his position, he bloody well should be our highest goal-scorer and would still be even if he was one of those players who just did their job in a formation (clue, scored goals) rather than being all of that, the second-coming and Gazza on a cracker at the same time. I would rather see this than people (Wazza included) shunted out of position to accommodate him because I'm one of those sane men, women or children who don't believe we'd win the thing with 11 of him. Nobody thinks Welbeck is a better option. Inventing a ridiculous argument that nobody is having to juxtapose your idea doesn't reflect as well upon it as you think. Jae, Tunbridge Wells (disgusted of?) I stopped at the Spanish not needing a good sing-along. Presumably you know that their anthem doesn't have any words (officially) and that quite obviously this is not the most important difference between the lavishly gifted Spain squad and that of the rather more workmanlike stylings of England. Beyond that, I couldn't really what sort of sensible point you might be about to make. Then the asterisks caught my eye and I might have done you a disservice. The bit in between was obviously bollocks but yes, this should be our new national anthem. Ed, Weymouth. Do it mate. I've been to south Dorset. It deserves it. Besides, I like Fearne. Rather more thanks to your capitalised MIDDLE-NAMING of her. Cheers, Jim (I know, not much constructive to offer) Essex Best World Cups Jim, Bali (Coming for your job, Degsy) is right. Get your money on Argentina. I've done a predictor as well and also have them beating Brazil in the final, although I have England going out to Columbia in the 2nd round (due to the stifling heat, Rooney playing like a hod carrier, and Glenn Johnson playing). Regarding favourite past tournaments, Argentina '78 was great partly due to the ticker tape and dark flowing locks of Mario Kempes, but 1982 in Spain comes out tops for me. The atmosphere was intense, and Brazil were unbelievable to watch (all you tiki-taka fans would do well to spend time having a shufty at that team to realise what exciting football really is). I could rhyme off a list of their footballing gods such as Socrates, Falcao, Junior, Zico, plus plenty of their goals which could've been sold off as works of art, and this would easily make my point, but the player who will always stick in my memory was Eder, who made the spectacular seem the norm. Volleys, chips, thunderb*st*rds were almost to be expected when he played. My favourite Eder moment was actually one that he missed, against Argentina, where he takes a lengthy run up not unlike cricketer Michael Holding would have done in his pomp (I can't find the Motson commentary but he chirped something like "And Eder is lining up what looks like a tremendous shot"), meets the ball with the outside of his foot and fires a curving, dipping piledriver which crashes against the bar, leaving Zico an easy tap in. Witness: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCFL1UEJ47M. Mesmerising. Their lack of concentration on defence meant they went out to eventual winners Italy, and a Paulo Rossi hat-trick, in the semis, but at least the Italy/Germany final provided this! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XOL8o-3TZ8. I rest my case. Steve Smith (LFC) Top XIs Re. Bernard (France 98 is still my fave) MUFC Here's my stab at your one country represented world cup XI (plus the full complement 12 on the bench because I like a challenge): GK: Thibaut Courtois - Belgium RB: Pablo Zabaleta - Argentina LB: Philipp Lahm - Germany CB: Sergio Ramos - Spain CB: Raphaël Varane - France DM: Daniele De Rossi - Italy CM: Yaya Touré - Ivory Coast CM: Fernandinho - Brazil RW: Alexis Sánchez - Chile LW: Cristiano Ronaldo - Portugal FW: Luis Suarez - Uruguay Subs: Joe Hart (England), Joël Matip (Cameroon), Stephan Lichtsteiner (Switazerland), Nigel De Jong (Netherlands), Mile Jedinak (Australia), Luka Modrić (Croatia), Fredy Guarín (Colombia), Shinji Kagawa (Japan), Miralem Pjanić (BiH), Javier Hernández (Mexico), Kevin-Prince Boateng (Ghana) , Igor Akinfeev (Russia) Blue Tim (France '98 is also my fav; watched it in a bowling alley in Boulogne on a school trip) ...Bernard (France 98 is still my fave) MUFC's letter is one of those classic World Cup warm-up games. Although, when he said his one Brazilian was a defender I was definitely expecting their best defender. Dante ahead of Silva?! An attempt (4-3-3): Akinfeev (Russia); Abate (Italy), Tiago Silva (Brazil), Kompany (Belgium), Lahm (Germany); Iniesta (Spain), Vidal (Chile), Pogba (France); Suarez (Uruguay), Messi (Argentina), Ronaldo (Portugal). Ok, Akinfeev is very good but probably not a world beater. In front of him though are a back 4 with so much ability I think he'd be safe enough. Joe Hart instead maybe? A midfield with a mix of power, dynamism and brains. And those 3 up front. Might not pass to each other a lot, but shouldn't need to. Paraic (Who should I support?), Ireland	sports

However, swapping Ozil for Fabregas would be silly. Top of our assist charts, one of the biggest summer signings globally, our catalyst for last season and a trophy. Selling him and bringing in Cesc will look (not necessarily be) a step backwards ... So what are the other options? Adding without selling would mean we would be overloaded in midfield. Cazorla? Love him to bits and would hate to see him leave but he is 29 now and Cesc certainly wouldn't be a downgrade. Arteta? Not really a like for like replacement but I felt Arteta has been on the decline this season.. Still sometimes you do need someone to slow the pace of the game down Wilshire? Tricky one this. If Wilshire can get over his injuries he could be world class but he has been out-shined by Ramsey and will surely get less play time next season as a result...However, you do need a certain amount of English players in the Champs squad. And he is very good Ramsey? No I think ultimately no matter how much we love Cesc, I don't think there is a space for him in the squad anymore (i would argue that the only choice would be for Cazorla). It would hurt to see him play for a different english club but I would hope that he would "be injured" whenever he played us Rob (To be honest, I don't think Ozil looked like he enjoyed playing at Real that much either) AFC Anthems To Jae, Tunbridge Wells, who had a pop at "God Save the Queen," just be thankful that you're not from the USA. We've got an anthem that is virtually unsingable (and the tune was written by a man named John Smith, for crying out loud), and whose words are so convoluted that maybe 1 out of 10 Americans can tell you what they actually mean. Almost nobody likes it. I'd be very happy with "God Save the Queen," and in fact we already have it here, only with different words and titled "My Country 'Tis of Thee." But we stick with "The Star Spangled Banner," because...well, because. But what I'd really like is "Il Canto Degli Italiani," the Italian national anthem, an unabashed piece of militarism that's just flat-out fun, in a way that only the Italians can manage. PeterG, Pennsylavnia, USA Zing To add to the Non-English and where we stand on supporting England..... I am from Cardiff, the Capital City of Wales. Support nobody but Cardiff City and Wales but have lived and worked in London for about 5 years. I have just drawn England in my work sweepstake. .............however I do get £16 as a losing finalist! Rob Addressing A Few Points Conor, Dublin Gooner. Apart from not being sure how Man U are Arsenal's "ex best-mate" and how Chelsea are their "younger, richer, more successful neighbour", I didn't think we were allowed to do those "It's like when you're going out with/not going out with/meeting up with when too drunk to realise it's a stupid idea" analogies any more. I mean, it just isn't like that. It's like when a bloke who used to play for your football team went and played for another one. It most assuredly is nothing like having a real girlfriend who then, ah...I see. Moving on. Frank Lampard's "obscene goal output" is largely due to him taking about 150 penalties (guessed) over his career at Chelsea. Given just this, my goal output would be at least "creditable". I'm with you Chris MUFC. I'd have preferred it if we hadn't appealed Rooney's quite-deserved 3 game ban and not taken him to the last tournament. I thought we were doing better without him. Of course, we'll never know but I think we might well be better off now if he were just another 9 as opposed to the supposedly essential and yet clearly detrimental axis around which everything else must be shoe-horned into orbit. In which case, Tom London, I heartily disagree. He's not our "best player" (subjective yet stated as fact). He's been the "essential axis around which everything else must be shoe-horned into orbit" for ten years and considering his position, he bloody well should be our highest goal-scorer and would still be even if he was one of those players who just did their job in a formation (clue, scored goals) rather than being all of that, the second-coming and Gazza on a cracker at the same time. I would rather see this than people (Wazza included) shunted out of position to accommodate him because I'm one of those sane men, women or children who don't believe we'd win the thing with 11 of him. Nobody thinks Welbeck is a better option. Inventing a ridiculous argument that nobody is having to juxtapose your idea doesn't reflect as well upon it as you think. Jae, Tunbridge Wells (disgusted of?) I stopped at the Spanish not needing a good sing-along. Presumably you know that their anthem doesn't have any words (officially) and that quite obviously this is not the most important difference between the lavishly gifted Spain squad and that of the rather more workmanlike stylings of England. Beyond that, I couldn't really what sort of sensible point you might be about to make. Then the asterisks caught my eye and I might have done you a disservice. The bit in between was obviously bollocks but yes, this should be our new national anthem. Ed, Weymouth. Do it mate. I've been to south Dorset. It deserves it. Besides, I like Fearne. Rather more thanks to your capitalised MIDDLE-NAMING of her. Cheers, Jim (I know, not much constructive to offer) Essex Best World Cups Jim, Bali (Coming for your job, Degsy) is right. Get your money on Argentina. I've done a predictor as well and also have them beating Brazil in the final, although I have England going out to Columbia in the 2nd round (due to the stifling heat, Rooney playing like a hod carrier, and Glenn Johnson playing). Regarding favourite past tournaments, Argentina '78 was great partly due to the ticker tape and dark flowing locks of Mario Kempes, but 1982 in Spain comes out tops for me. The atmosphere was intense, and Brazil were unbelievable to watch (all you tiki-taka fans would do well to spend time having a shufty at that team to realise what exciting football really is). I could rhyme off a list of their footballing gods such as Socrates, Falcao, Junior, Zico, plus plenty of their goals which could've been sold off as works of art, and this would easily make my point, but the player who will always stick in my memory was Eder, who made the spectacular seem the norm. Volleys, chips, thunderb*st*rds were almost to be expected when he played. My favourite Eder moment was actually one that he missed, against Argentina, where he takes a lengthy run up not unlike cricketer Michael Holding would have done in his pomp (I can't find the Motson commentary but he chirped something like "And Eder is lining up what looks like a tremendous shot"), meets the ball with the outside of his foot and fires a curving, dipping piledriver which crashes against the bar, leaving Zico an easy tap in. Witness: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCFL1UEJ47M. Mesmerising. Their lack of concentration on defence meant they went out to eventual winners Italy, and a Paulo Rossi hat-trick, in the semis, but at least the Italy/Germany final provided this! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XOL8o-3TZ8. I rest my case. Steve Smith (LFC) Top XIs Re. Bernard (France 98 is still my fave) MUFC Here's my stab at your one country represented world cup XI (plus the full complement 12 on the bench because I like a challenge): GK: Thibaut Courtois - Belgium RB: Pablo Zabaleta - Argentina LB: Philipp Lahm - Germany CB: Sergio Ramos - Spain CB: Raphaël Varane - France DM: Daniele De Rossi - Italy CM: Yaya Touré - Ivory Coast CM: Fernandinho - Brazil RW: Alexis Sánchez - Chile LW: Cristiano Ronaldo - Portugal FW: Luis Suarez - Uruguay Subs: Joe Hart (England), Joël Matip (Cameroon), Stephan Lichtsteiner (Switazerland), Nigel De Jong (Netherlands), Mile Jedinak (Australia), Luka Modrić (Croatia), Fredy Guarín (Colombia), Shinji Kagawa (Japan), Miralem Pjanić (BiH), Javier Hernández (Mexico), Kevin-Prince Boateng (Ghana) , Igor Akinfeev (Russia) Blue Tim (France '98 is also my fav; watched it in a bowling alley in Boulogne on a school trip) ...Bernard (France 98 is still my fave) MUFC's letter is one of those classic World Cup warm-up games. Although, when he said his one Brazilian was a defender I was definitely expecting their best defender. Dante ahead of Silva?! An attempt (4-3-3): Akinfeev (Russia); Abate (Italy), Tiago Silva (Brazil), Kompany (Belgium), Lahm (Germany); Iniesta (Spain), Vidal (Chile), Pogba (France); Suarez (Uruguay), Messi (Argentina), Ronaldo (Portugal). Ok, Akinfeev is very good but probably not a world beater. In front of him though are a back 4 with so much ability I think he'd be safe enough. Joe Hart instead maybe? A midfield with a mix of power, dynamism and brains. And those 3 up front. Might not pass to each other a lot, but shouldn't need to. Paraic (Who should I support?), Ireland	sports

World Cup Group Analysis: Group G - Goal.com	Goal analyzes all the eight groups in this year's world cup. Continuing with our series, we take a look at Group G... SPECIAL By Shikharr Chandra GERMANY Profile Titles: FIFA World Cup (1954, 1974, 1990), Confederations Cup (1999), European Championship (1972, 1980, 1996)  Top Scorer: Miroslav Klose (68) Most Apearances: Lothar Matthaus (150) FIFA Ranking: 2 Star Man: Mario Gotze Appearances: 28 Goals: 7 Formation 4-2-3-1   Coach Part of the German camp for over 10 years now, Joachim Low comes across as one of the most offensive coaches in this summer's tournament. Low, who has led the Germans in the last two European Championships and the 2010 World Cup, which saw his side succumb to pressure during the final few games of each of those tournaments. Low's philosophy is based on quick passing and keeping possession. What would be interesting to note is whether he will play with a false 9 or go with a more direct approach with a center forward in the side. How they set up Die Adler will look to setup in their usual 4-2-3-1 formation with the main aim being to keep the ball and not allow the oppositions to take control of the game. Low, whose German sides were based on quick counter attacks four years ago have completely changed their setup and ball retention now remains the key aspect of their game. It will be interesting to see if Sami Khedira gets a run-in the side considering how little he's played in the seson gone by. Instead, the likes of Toni Kroos and Bastian Schweinsteiger offer much more in that role than the Real Madrid midfielder. The pressing question though, is whether Germany opt for a false nine in Mario Gotze or go for an out and out striker in Miroslav Klose. He has tested the use of a false nine over the last few years now and it is highly likely that the side may use Gotze to fill in that role. Key Players The likes of Gotze, Lukas Podolski, Thomas Muller, Mesut Ozil all add attacking quality to the side and are most likely to provide goals considering the dearth of strikers. The impressive form of defender turned midfielder Phillip Lahm is an encouraging sign for the manager. Lahm spent most of the season as a central midfielder and provides another option in that department. Manuel Neuer, rated as one of the best goalkeepers in the world, will certainly play a key role in ensuring Germany have a successful campaign. Strengths and Weaknesses Germany's major weakness is in their striking department. It is most likely that the side will start with a false nine in Gotze, but Low's experiment has hardly paid off over the past few years where the Germans have looked unconvincing to say the least. The injury to star midfielder Marco Reus comes as a big blow, given that the Dortmund winger was the most in-form German player heading into the tournament. Their midfield though is capable of winning any games. The side has enormous depth and quality to provide both goals and assists and bail them out from pressure situations. The Bayern Munich contigent in the side has had an exceptional domestic season and their form will be key to the side's chances of winning the cup. Expectation As always, Germany will go in the tournament as one of the favourites to lift the World Cup. Low's side have all the quality and depth and anything less than a semi-final finish could be seen as a major disappointment. Their major test though will come towards the end of the tournament and it will be interesting to see, whether they could cope with pressure.  PORTUGAL Profile Titles: None Top Scorer: Cristiano Ronaldo (49) Most Apearances: Luis Figo (127) FIFA Ranking: 4 Star Man: Cristiano Ronaldo Appearances: 110 Goals: 49 Formation 4-3-3   Coach Head coach Paulo Bento has now been a part of the camp for over four years and his quick counter attacking style has benefited the side in recent tournaments. He  has improved this side drastically from the one Carlos Queiroz had and although his side lack the quality the most major teams possess, Bento's Portugal could surprise a few. How they set up Bento's side is expeced to line up in their usual 4-3-3 formation with Helder Postiga being supported by Cristiano Ronaldo and Nani from the wings. The impressive form of William Carvalho this season could see him dethrone Raul Meireles as the defensive midfielder in the side whereas both Joao Moutinho and Miguel Veloso would provide the creative spark for the side. The major factor though will be whether Bento goes for an out and out striker in Postiga or shifts Ronaldo as the center forward. The side has hardly changed from the one that was put out in the Euro 2012 and the counter attacking style is expected to continue in Brazil as well. Key Players Ronaldo will once again be the star man in the Portuguese lineup. The Real Madrid man has had a blistering year playing a key role in the side's tenth European crown. The Real Madrid forward can provide goals, assits and is dangerous from set pieces. Alongside Ronaldo, Portugal's impressive midfield of Meireles, Moutinho will play a key role in assisting Cristiano in attack whereas in form Carvlaho will play a key role as the defensive midfielder in the side. Defensively the form of Pepe and Fabio Coentrao will come as a major boost for Bento and the camp. Strengths and Weaknesses Portugal's strength comes in their industrious midfield and their defensive solidarity. The likes of Bruno Alves, Fabio Coentrao and Pepe provide both defensive certainty as well as attacking threat from set pieces. Of course Ronaldo is their star player and his performances will determine how they shape up in attack. Portugal need to ensure they amalgamate around Ronaldo. Miguel Veloso, Moutinho provide creativity whereas Carvalho and Meireles will provide some much needed cover in their defensive third. Portugal's Achiles Heel has always been their striking department. A Selecao have not found the right man to lead them upfront for some time now and the idea of playing Ronaldo as a striker instead on the wings could backfire. The Real Madrid man has often been delpoyed as a number nine but has failed to flourish in the same manner as he has on the wings. The lack of game time for Manchester United winger Nani could be another issue for Bento in the tournament. The former Sporting manager needs to find the right partner for Ronaldo in attack and at present the options in hand don't look great. Expectation The Portuguese will be expected to progress from the group but it's hard to see them lasting long in the tournament. Anything over quarter-finals will be seen a good achievement  for Bento's side. GHANA Profile Titles: African Cup of Nations ( 1963, 1965, 1978, 1982) Top Scorer: Edward Acquah (40) Most Apearances: Asamoah Gyan (at present-77) FIFA Ranking: 38 Star Man: Asamoah Gyan Appearances: 77 Goals: 39 Formation 4-2-3-1   Coach Coach Kwesi Appiah becomes the only homegrown coach to lead Ghana into the World Cup finals. He is also among the two African coaches in this summers tournament. Appiah is no stranger to this side having led them as a caretaker manager before and was also the assistant manager when the side finished fourth in the African Cup of Nations back in 2013. The Ghanaian is known to provide free flowing attacking football and despite a demanding group, the  Black Stars are expected to continue their exciting brand of football. How they set up Ghana will lineup in their usual 4-2-3-1 formation, with the main focus being on their attack and the stern midfield they have at their disposal. The likes of Micheal Essien, Suley Muntari and Andrew Ayew provide quality as well as experience in the heart of the midfield, whereas Kevin Prince-Boateng will look to play a key role in the attack. Chelsea's youngster Christian Atsu could surprise a few with his skill and flair and can be one of the leading young prospects of the tournament. Appiah's use of 4-4-2 and often 4-5-1 gives them an alternative plan going into the game which could prove to be useful in defending against the likes of Portugal or Germany when needed.  Key Players Asamoah Gyan will look to put away the nightmare of the last World Cup behind him and lead the attack for the Africans. The former Sunderland striker has a knack for goals and his experience in the attack will come in handy. The likes of Essien, Boateng and Muntari will play a major role as well in providing balance to the side. Strengths and Weaknesses Ghana's strength lies in their experience. The likes of Essien, Muntari, Gyan, Boateng have all played for leading European clubs and have the experience of handling pressure situations. Appiah has done well to get the best out of this side on numerous occasions and their impressive qualifying campaign serves as an indication of that. Their major weakness though comes in the defense. As much as their front men look established and well settled, the same cannot be said about their rear guard. The full back position remains one of the major issue of the side as Samuel Inkoom has hardly done enough to warrant a place in the team whereas the center back position looks unsettled too as Appiah still does not know his best back four. Expectation Ghana could surprise a few in this summer's tournament. The squad is experienced and have players capable of producing inspirational moments when needed. They could possibly manage to surpass the group but anything more than that looks a distant dream. U.S.A Profile Titles: CONCACAF Gold Cup (1991, 2002, 2005, 2007, 2013) Top Scorer: Landon Donovan (57) Most Appearances: Cobi Jones (164) FIFA Ranking: 13 Star Man: Clint Dempsey Appearances: 104 Goals: 37 Formation 4-2-3-1   Coach The forer German international and coach, Jurgen Klinsmann will make his second appearance in the World Cup after leading the Germans to a semi-final finish in the 2006 World Cup. The former Bayern Munich manager has based his footballing philosophy on attack over the years and despite having a torrid start to life as US Men's National team coach (USMNT), the German has won over many hearts following their impressive performance in the CONACAF Championships last year. How they set up Klinsmann will look to set his side up in the usual 4-2-3-1 formation with Jozy Altidore leading the side from the front and Clint Dempsey providing the support right behind him. Michael Bradley will play the role of the anchorman in the midfield and will look to provide the key passes, as well as make those forward runs he is so used to. His partner Jermaine Jones is expected to cover up for him and do most of the dirty work in the side. Graham Zusi and Cobi Jones will make up the forward line in the attack alongside Dempsey and their pace and skills will come in handy. Damarcus Beasley's impressive form will see him continue as the left back despite being played as a midfielder for most part of his career, whereas impressive Matt Bresler will lead the defense. Jozy Altidore's strength makes him a good option to have upfront as it will allow him to hold the ball better thus allowing the rest to take part in the attack and providing more options for Klinsmann's men. Key Players One needs to look no further than the two most experienced players in the side in Tim Howard and Clint Dempsey as the star men. The duo have over 200 caps together and could play a key role in the side. Dempsey will have some added pressure on him considering the absence of Landon Donovan from the side this summer. Graham Zusi is another player who will garner much attention. The midfielder has been called up as a replacement for Donovan and a lot of eyes will be on him to deliver and live upto the expectations of his coach. Strengths and Weaknesses USA's major strength lies upfront with the likes of Zusi, Dempsey, Bradley all having a relatively decent seasons with their repective clubs. What will be worrying though is the form of striker Altidore who has had a torrid season for Sunderland this time around. The absence of Donovan though comes as the major blow for the side and could hurt them. Klinsmann might have taken a big step by omitting the star midfielder, but it is a gamble that could backfire. Beasley's impressive performances as a left back comes as a much needed boost for the side. The midfielder turned defender has done well for the national side over the years and could provide necessary cover for the defense. Expectation Not many will give the USMNT a chance to progress from this group. The CONCACAF Champions have a good squad but when pitted against the likes of Portugal and Ghana there is hardly any chance. A group stage exit looks likely. PREDICTION: 1. Germany 2. Portugal 3. Ghana 4. USA	sports

Brazil's World Cup hopes rest on the shoulders of Neymar - Goal.com	The Brazilian is arguably the best player in the Selecao squad and and his form could play a key role in their quest to land the World Cup after 12 long years... COMMENT By Shikharr Chandra On Monday morning, just two days before the opening game of the World Cup Neymar went down holding his ankle at the Teresopolis training ground in front of more than a thousand Brazil fans. There was a sense of anxiety among the supporters who saw their talisman down injured. A few minutes later, the Barcelona forward stood up and placed the ball to practice his free kicks. Neymar curled in three back-to-back free kicks right in the top corner with five men in the wall plus the goal-keeper who were left out as mere spectators. Service was restored in the Brazil camp. Neymar is without doubt the most influential player in this Brazil squad. A player on whom rests the hopes of not only the entire nation but also the millions of Brazil supporters all over the world. The portraits of the former Santos star can be found painted on the streets of Kolkata as well. A flag with 'We don’t score with our hand' printed on it shows the loyalty the city has for the Brazilians and the expectations they have from the 'Prince' of the Selecao. For few years now, Neymar has been the rising star of this Brazil squad. The potential was always there, it was just the matter of how ready the 22-year old was to dawn the famous yellow jersey of Brazil. South American Footballer of the year at the age of 19, Neymar followed it with a Ballon D'Or nomination as well as landing the Puskas award the same year. He had announced himself to the world at such a tender age. Handed over the famous number 10 jersey for Brazil, previously dawned by the likes of Pele and Zico, in him the fans saw their messiah and the team-mates saw a player they could rely on during times of adversity. This was pretty evident with his performances first in the South American Youth Championships, then at the Olympics and later at the Confederations Cup, where he was handed the Golden Ball award for his impressive performances throughout the tournament. While the trust and the confidence bestowed by the fans has been incredible, there is a sense of fret amongst the supporters as well, as to whether their 'Prince' can live upto all the hype that has surrounded him this time around or will he succumb to pressure as many believe he has after his first season at Nou Camp. Neymar's Barcelona journey hasn't gone as planned, both on as well as off the field. The controversy surrounding his transfer usurped the likes of Barcelona president Sandro Rosell and eventually led to a trophyless season with manager Tata Martino being sacked. While many blame it on him not getting his desired role at the club due to the presence of a certain Lionel Messi in the squad, some believe the over the top expectations in his very first season in Europe led to the 'disappointment'. But judging him based on his Barcelona career is rather harsh. For a player born and bred in the South American style of football, it was never going to be easy settling into the European life. In addition to this, the psychological pressure of living up to the transfer fee that still remains one of the biggest mystery of last season. Add to this the constant comparison with Real Madrid's Gareth Bale certainly took a toll on him. His on-field antics did not help his case as well. From 28 starts for Barcelona, Neymar has scored 15 goals and provided 11 assists in all competitions. Flop? Definitely not. Especially when you consider him playing second fiddle to Messi for the majority of the season. At Brazil though, things are different. Luiz Felipe Scolari has based his entire setup to get the best out of his star player. From being deployed on the left flank, Neymar has been given the license to roam around and get as much of the ball as he can. Even striker Fred's duty is too hold the ball and involve the Barcelona forward as much as possible. Scolari knows the potential of Neymar and what he is capable of. When at his best, Neymar is an enticing player, probably on the same level as Cristiano Ronaldo or Messi. Neymar is at his exclusive best when donning the yellow jersey. His dribbling coupled with blistering pace make him a player worth watching on field. He makes things look so simple. The video of him stepping upto take the penalty kick during training and suddenly hitting it with the other leg caught the attention of millions on YouTube. Neymar's skills are not just limited to off-field show boating, on the field as well he has sparkled with the ball on his feet, blazing past defenders and often leaving them for dead. While his upper body strength remains in question as to whether he can handle the persistent fouls that come his way during the tournament, there is little doubt about his mental strength given that he has grown up with challenges in front of him and has consistently delivered on high expectations. The sun shone on Neymar during their game against Panama, and the entire nation will be hoping the sun shines on their wonder boy as he steps out at Sao Paolo tonight. A city that has seen so many struggles and protests lately because of the World Cup, needs its posterboy to step up and provide the trophy they are so obsessed with	sports

Add to this the constant comparison with Real Madrid's Gareth Bale certainly took a toll on him. His on-field antics did not help his case as well. From 28 starts for Barcelona, Neymar has scored 15 goals and provided 11 assists in all competitions. Flop? Definitely not. Especially when you consider him playing second fiddle to Messi for the majority of the season. At Brazil though, things are different. Luiz Felipe Scolari has based his entire setup to get the best out of his star player. From being deployed on the left flank, Neymar has been given the license to roam around and get as much of the ball as he can. Even striker Fred's duty is too hold the ball and involve the Barcelona forward as much as possible. Scolari knows the potential of Neymar and what he is capable of. When at his best, Neymar is an enticing player, probably on the same level as Cristiano Ronaldo or Messi. Neymar is at his exclusive best when donning the yellow jersey. His dribbling coupled with blistering pace make him a player worth watching on field. He makes things look so simple. The video of him stepping upto take the penalty kick during training and suddenly hitting it with the other leg caught the attention of millions on YouTube. Neymar's skills are not just limited to off-field show boating, on the field as well he has sparkled with the ball on his feet, blazing past defenders and often leaving them for dead. While his upper body strength remains in question as to whether he can handle the persistent fouls that come his way during the tournament, there is little doubt about his mental strength given that he has grown up with challenges in front of him and has consistently delivered on high expectations. The sun shone on Neymar during their game against Panama, and the entire nation will be hoping the sun shines on their wonder boy as he steps out at Sao Paolo tonight. A city that has seen so many struggles and protests lately because of the World Cup, needs its posterboy to step up and provide the trophy they are so obsessed with	sports

Karim Bencherifa: I want to win a trophy for Pune FC - Goal.com	The former Mariners coach explains that he is an ardent admirer of his new club's professionalism, hopes to establish an I-League winning team... Karim Bencharifa has stated that he hopes to put the experience he has gained from an ill-fated second reign at Mohun Bagan, to ensure that Pune FC are the ones who gain the most through his mentoring.   Speaking to Goal, Bencherifa was asked to shed light on his stint at Mohun Bagan, which saw the Kolkata stalwarts finish a lowly eighth last season. “It was challenging and difficult but it was another learning experience which will be useful for my coaching carrier. "There were ups and downs, but I was hoping to do much better. For different reasons, it didn't happen. One of my biggest satisfactions is the discovery of some exciting new talents, which is almost impossible to do with the big Kolkata clubs due to the pressure on players and coaches.” Pressurized to describe the intricacies that led to his team’s poor form, Bencherifa chose to be non-committal. “Without going through the details when a team doesn't do well, the coach must take responsibility for that. So one of the reasons is myself but there other reasons which I don't want to elaborate and anyway I am a person who looks forward rather than complaining about the past. Overall there were many good moments and I will remember only this.” Having plied his trade in Goa and Kolkata only, Benncherifa's next job is in a city which isn't traditionally known to be a football hob. “I have no problem with that though I do feel that Pune have many people who know and follow the game. It is up to us to bring them to the stadium and get them interested more in the team, the key is our performances. We, including the players and the staff, have to create a dynamic around the club; play well, win games, be consistent and that's the key,” elucidated Bencherifa, who acknowledged the task at hand. Questioned on his target with the Red Lizards, he expressed hopefulness by stating that he would want to win a trophy with the club who haven't yet laid their hands on silverware. “I wish to help the club get the first silverware. Though Pune FC hasn’t won any trophy yet I think they did a lot for Indian football and the I-League. They brought a lot of professionalism and fresh ideas on how to run a club. "They are a model in youth development and this will definitely work for the benefit of the club in the near future. So I am very hopeful about the outcome of the next season or two.” “Well despite that, I think over the years Pune FC always managed to build quite a strong, competitive team and we will try to do the same this year. The base and core of the team is there already, with some quality youngsters pushing their way to the first team." Pune FC are known not to splurge in the transfer market unlike some of the biggest Kolkata clubs. Bencherifa isn't concerned as he believes a pragmatic approach to finance is always a good option. "There is nothing wrong when a club spends wisely and that’s what usually happens here,” replied Bencherifa. Finally the Moroccan aired his views on a long standing belief, that Pune FC were the most professional team in the country. “As I’ve said before, Pune FC leads the way when it comes to professionalism, from the way they handle and take care of the first team, the organisation of the I-League matches, the setup of the youth development etc. "I am sure there will be much more to come. That’s one of the reasons I am excited to be associated with this club,” concluded Bencherifa, who no doubt wishes to weave an I-League winning campaign at his latest club.  	sports

2014 World Cup Brazil: A Primer - Goal.com	Goal takes time out to deconstruct the facts of the World Cup before it finally gets underway... The greatest tournament on earth is about to get underway in the football capital of the world in Brazil and Goal lays out the basic must know facts for anyone and everyone who wishes to survive for the next month and a half without appearing completely out of the loop.  What is the World Cup?    When the need for an international football competition arose especially after the tremendous popularity of the sport, an amateur competition in the Olympics wasn't enough and a professional pan world competition was the order of the day leading to the 1930 'World Cup' in Uruguay which had seven nations from South America, four from Europe and two from North America with the host nation being victorious, in the inaugural competition. Who organises it? The first global football competition in the Olympics with only amateurs was organised by the FA (Football Association) of Britain. Then came the existence of FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association), a body found in Switzerland by the football associations of Belgium, France, Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden and Germany for organising the game globally. Britain soon became a member and it was in 1950 Brazil that England finally participated in the World Cup which was again won by Uruguay. How many teams participate in the 'World Cup'? Originally it was limited to 16 nations till 1978 and expanded to 24 teams in 1982 and finally to its present number of 32 since 1986. Recently it was proposed by UEFA president Michel Platini, that the World Cup could be extended to 40 nations. "The World Cup is] not based on the quality of the teams because you don't have the best 32 at the World Cup, but it's a good compromise. It's a political matter so why not have more Africans? The competition is to bring all the people of all the world. If you don't give the possibility to participate, they don't improve."  Can we really call it the World Cup?  Not really but it certainly comes close in spite of the domination of the European and South American nations. In the soon to kickoff 2014 World Cup, 13 nations are from Europe, 6 from South America, 4 from North America, 5 from Africa and 4 from Asia. If you were to take the 32 best teams in the world, this would certainly not be it, but this certainly comes close in accordance of FIFA distributing berths regionally. Who is the official mascot of the FIFA World Cup? In keeping with the World Cup tradition of having a mascot, this time it's the turn of a three-banded Brazilian Armaddillo, a species native to Brazil and placed in the UN Red list amongst those vulnerable. Fuleco was the name chosen by fans which is a combination of the words football and ecology. The lively character can be found wearing a white T-shirt with the words 'Brasil 2014'.  Where will the World Cup be played? With the rotatory policy of FIFA, it was the turn of South America to host the 'Cup of Joy' and only Colombia and Brazil were the interested parties. However later with Colombia pulling out, Brazil were the only choice. Twelve venues in Brazil have been selected to host the grand competition with seven brand new and five renovated stadiums. These included popular spots like Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and Brasilia to relatively desolate spots like Manaus, which have no local football team.  What is the reason for all the protests if Brazil is such a football crazy nation? We might think that a zealous football loving nation like Brazil would be overjoyed to host the sport they love. Of course they are, but the ground realities are very harsh. With the nation in an impoverished condition, the people are not taking it too kindly as the Brasil government has bowed down to all the demands of FIFA including tax exemption to the tune of more than 270 million dollars. A Brazil public safety law which prohibited alcohol consumption in stadiums too was turned down because one of the alcohol beverage company was one of the official sponsors of the World Cup. When can I watch the World Cup?  For us in India, the World Cup starts like everyone else from tomorrow. But, with the drastically different time zones, the games will unfortunately be telecasted from midnight to dawn, with kickoffs at 12.30 AM, 1.30 AM, 3.30 AM and 6.30 AM. For the people who cannot stay awake even for this, breathe easy -as there are indeed a couple of matches at primetime which is 9.30 PM. For the complete TV Guide to the World Cup look here.  Why does the World Cup have an official ball?  Since 1970 Adidas has been an official sponsor for FIFA in World Cups and part of this is they get to name the official match ball in the Cup. For the last World Cup, it was christened Jabulani and this time it is Brazuca, the first ball to have its name was chosen by the fans. An interesting fact with regards to the Brazuca, is that the ball was manufactured close to home, by Forward Sports in Sialkot, Pakistan. 	sports

Messi fooled by Ronaldinho lookalike - Goal.com	The Argentina attacker was met by a pitch invader he momentarily took for his former Barcelona team-mate in the Albiceleste's training session on Wednesday By Ben Hayward in Belo Horizonte Lionel Messi was taken by surprise during  Argentina's training session on Wednesday by a pitch invader he briefly mistook for his former Barcelona team-mate and friend Ronaldinho. Argentina trained in front of thousands of fans and press at Belo Horizonte's Estadio Independencia, where Ronaldinho regularly turns out for Atletico Mineiro. After some light running, the Albiceleste squad were divided into small groups for games of football-tennis in a low-key session which finished amid chaos as over a dozen supporters climbed over the fences to invade the pitch and ran in search of a handshake or a hug from their heroes. Most headed in Messi's direction and security guards were overwhelmed in their attempts to halt the fans as the practice was quickly brought to an abrupt end. But the Argentine was initially fooled by the Ronaldinho double. Robinson Oliveira, who works as a professional lookalike of the Brazilian forward, told Goal: "When he saw me he was shocked because he thought I was the real Ronaldinho and he told me that I didn't need to run on the pitch to see him. "He said: 'What are you doing running on here to see me?' When he held my hand, I went down on my knees [and bowed]. It was so emotional." He added: "I didn't plan this. I just thought to myself that I have to hold his hand because this is the only opportunity I will have to see him." The lookalike, who bears an uncanny resemblance to the former Barca hero, ended up with a bloodied hand after scaling the fence in his adventure to meet Messi, but said: "It was worth it." Asked which of the two players he prefers, he replied: "Ronaldinho, of course!" Argentina and Messi kick off their World Cup campaign against Bosnia at the Maracana on Sunday.	sports

'My mission isn't finished' - Blatter to stand for re-election - Goal.com	Despite severe criticism from high-profile figures in football and calls for him to stand down, the leader of world football's governing body says he will stand for election again Sepp Blatter will stand for re-election as Fifa president after the organisation voted against term and age limits for officials. The 78-year-old's widely anticipated announcement that he is to pursue a fifth term in office comes amid a tumultuous week personally in the build-up to the World Cup in Brazil. Blatter branded UK newspaper reports of fresh corruption allegations relating to the voting process for the hosting of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar as racist, bringing sustained criticism from leading figures in Uefa and across European football. Yet, despite this groundswell of continental ill-feeling against Blatter, the vote at the Fifa Congress to reject limits on the age of officials and the lengths of term they can serve demonstrated the widespread support he retains across world football's governing body. Welcomed to the stage with applause as he made his closing remarks in Sao Paulo, Blatter said: "I know that my mandate will finish next year on 29 May in Zurich. But my mission is not finished. "And I tell you together we will build the new Fifa together. We have the foundations today because we have the budget for the next four years. "We have the foundation, now we work. Congress, you will decide who takes this great institution forward. "But I can tell you I am ready to accompany you in the future." Jerome Champagne, whose confirmed candidacy for the Fifa presidency in 2015 has won high-profile support in the form of Pele, made a prompt statement in response to Blatter's announcement. It read: "For the past years and in particular since I declared my candidacy on January 20, 2014 in London, I have been defending the need of a genuine, respectful and fair-play debate on all issues affecting Fifa and football in the 21st century. "Moreover, in any democratic organisation, the election of its president is about vision, programmes and manifestos. No one should fear this open discussion in front of the people of football, which would honour those organising and conducting it." Blatter, meanwhile, also suggested football could follow in the footsteps of cricket by allowing managers two challenges to officials' decisions per game by reviewing instant television replays of contentious incidents - a major departure from his previous caution over introducing greater technology into football. "We could do something more on the field of play," Blatter said. "Why don't we give team managers the possibility of two challenges for refereeing during the match? If the manager disagrees with a decision why should he not ask for an immediate TV review with the referee?" Blatter did sound a far less polarising tone earlier in the day when he called for stronger action to be taken to curb racism in world football. He said: "We must impose the toughest punishment to send a clear message. Suspension and empty stadia is not enough. As coming out of the resoution of last year, we should be docking points, expelling teams, or relegating them. This would be an example for all the others."	sports

'We know how to stop Brazil' - Kovac - Goal.com	The Eastern Europeans meet the tournament hosts to kick off the tournament and the coach is adamant his side can get something from the game Croatia coach Niko Kovac says his team know what they have to do to stop Brazil and Neymar when they meet in the opening match of the World Cup. The two sides kick off the tournament on Thursday at the Corinthians Arena with Brazil the favourites to win the match and the competition outright. But Kovac insists it will be no easy task for Luiz Felipe Scolari's men and says his team are capable of handling them. "We know how to stop Neymar and Brazil," Kovac said at his press conference. "Brazil is not only Neymar - they have a great team, but Croatia also have excellent players. "All those in the team know how nice it is to play for Croatia and how much we love our people. We will leave our heart on the field." The teams last met in the 2006 World Cup in Germany, with Brazil winning 1-0, but Kovac says his side will fight for a good result against the five-time world champions and vowed to attack throughout the game. The coach continued: "In Berlin, we were not able to surprise them, but we will give our best. No surrender - we will attack Brazil! Just as we did in the Serbia friendly. Possession is very important because Brazilians do not like to run for the ball." Croatia captain Dario Srna also vowed to make it difficult for the South American hosts, insisting they will make their fans proud of them. "I cannot promise that we'll go get a group win or beat Brazil, but we'll give every ounce of energy," he said. " It is a big day for us.  All Croatians will be proud.  "The pitch is great and our preparation went great, the conditions in the camp are excellent, arriving in Sao Paulo went without problems.  "Fernandinho and Willian are my friends. We agree that Brazil is the favourite, but they will not find it easy."	sports

'We know how to stop Brazil' - Kovac - Goal.com	The Eastern Europeans meet the tournament hosts to kick off the tournament and the coach is adamant his side can get something from the game Croatia coach Niko Kovac says his team know what they have to do to stop Brazil and Neymar when they meet in the opening match of the World Cup.

'My mission isn't finished' - Blatter to stand for re-election - Goal.com	Despite severe criticism from high-profile figures in football and calls for him to stand down, the leader of world football's governing body says he will stand for election again Sepp Blatter will stand for re-election as Fifa president after the organisation voted against term and age limits for officials. The 78-year-old's widely anticipated announcement that he is to pursue a fifth term in office comes amid a tumultuous week personally in the build-up to the World Cup in Brazil. Blatter branded UK newspaper reports of fresh corruption allegations relating to the voting process for the hosting of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar as racist, bringing sustained criticism from leading figures in Uefa and across European football. Yet, despite this groundswell of continental ill-feeling against Blatter, the vote at the Fifa Congress to reject limits on the age of officials and the lengths of term they can serve demonstrated the widespread support he retains across world football's governing body. Welcomed to the stage with applause as he made his closing remarks in Sao Paulo, Blatter said: "I know that my mandate will finish next year on 29 May in Zurich. But my mission is not finished. "And I tell you together we will build the new Fifa together. We have the foundations today because we have the budget for the next four years. "We have the foundation, now we work. Congress, you will decide who takes this great institution forward. "But I can tell you I am ready to accompany you in the future." Jerome Champagne, whose confirmed candidacy for the Fifa presidency in 2015 has won high-profile support in the form of Pele, made a prompt statement in response to Blatter's announcement. It read: "For the past years and in particular since I declared my candidacy on January 20, 2014 in London, I have been defending the need of a genuine, respectful and fair-play debate on all issues affecting Fifa and football in the 21st century. "Moreover, in any democratic organisation, the election of its president is about vision, programmes and manifestos. No one should fear this open discussion in front of the people of football, which would honour those organising and conducting it." Blatter, meanwhile, also suggested football could follow in the footsteps of cricket by allowing managers two challenges to officials' decisions per game by reviewing instant television replays of contentious incidents - a major departure from his previous caution over introducing greater technology into football. "We could do something more on the field of play," Blatter said. "Why don't we give team managers the possibility of two challenges for refereeing during the match? If the manager disagrees with a decision why should he not ask for an immediate TV review with the referee?" Blatter did sound a far less polarising tone earlier in the day when he called for stronger action to be taken to curb racism in world football. He said: "We must impose the toughest punishment to send a clear message. Suspension and empty stadia is not enough. As coming out of the resoution of last year, we should be docking points, expelling teams, or relegating them. This would be an example for all the others."	sports
Van Persie, Robben and Sneijder are a real threat, admits Martinez - Goal.com	The Spain international admits his side have to be wary of the Dutch trio and says they are desperate to win their opening game of the tournament Spain midfielder Javi Martinez has highlighted Netherlands attackers Robin van Persie, Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder as a real threat to his side's chances in their World Cup opener on Friday. The two teams meet in a replay of the 2010 final, in which an Andres Iniesta goal in extra time clinched the trophy for the Spaniards after Arjen Robben had missed a glorious opportunity on the hour mark. And Martinez believes the reigning European and world champions will have to be wary of his Bayern team-mate along with Van Persie and Sneijder in the re-match. "Their biggest threat are their front three, who are all world class," he told reporters. "Robben is excellent at drifting into space and we will have to watch out for that." The 25-year-old says he has spoken to Robben about that missed chance four years ago. Martinez continued: "We have talked about it in the past couple of years. It was a bitter blow for Holland and him personally. "We've spoken about that match and the one-on-ones against Iker a fair few times. Before the 2013 Champions League final I told him not to blow his opportunity to make amends and he didn't." Martinez believes there is extra pressure on Spain to win their opening game in such a tight group which also consists of Chile and Australia. "After losing our first game last time round, the onus is on us not to do the same thing again," he said. "We showed that it isn't the be-all and end-all in South Africa, but getting off to a good start gives you extra confidence, even though we ended up as champions four years ago." The former Athletic Bilbao player also reflected on last year's Confederations Cup defeat to Brazil, the tournament hosts who are rated as favourites to win this year's tournament. "Brazil were more aggressive than us," conceded Martinez. "We were outclassed and it was a wake-up call. If we're not up for every match, anyone can beat us."	sports

Chelsea boss Mourinho rules out Hazard exit - Goal.com	The Portuguese has no intention of letting the Belgian leave west London despite claiming that he was "not ready to sacrifice himself 100 per cent for the team" last term Jose Mourinho has dismissed speculation surrounding Eden Hazard's future, declaring that the Belgian will not be allowed to leave Chelsea this summer. The 23-year-old had been heavily linked with French champions Paris Saint-Germain, with Laurent Blanc publicly expressing interest in the attacker, though Hazard has since said he is certain to remain in London. And Mourinho, despite having been critical of Hazard during last season's Premier League run-in, has now confirmed that he has no intention of letting the former Lille man leave Stamford Bridge. "Just because I say that Eden does not have everything, it doesn't mean I don't want him," the Portuguese told L'Equipe. "He has fantastic potential and will express it at Chelsea. For him, as for others, the door is closed. People who know me know that, when I say that, I mean it." Hazard was Chelsea's top scorer in the Premier League last season, netting 14 times, while he also made seven assists. Though the west Londoners have already sold David Luiz to PSG, as well as releasing Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole, Hazard is highly unlikely to join them in leaving Chelsea and is in the process of sealing a contract extension. "I am staying at Chelsea, [that is] 100 per cent sure," he told Le Derniere Heure on Monday. "I am in discussions with Chelsea for a new contract. "It is only the beginning of the talks right now so we have got time but the fact that Chelsea have offered me a new deal means that they have got a lot of confidence in me that I can do a good job and that they can count on me."	sports

Pirlo: Italy must be careful against improving England - Goal.com	The veteran Juventus midfielder says that the Azzurri "know how to face" Saturday's Group D opponents, though he urges caution against the Three Lions' young, fast starlets Italy midfielder Andrea Pirlo has warned his team-mates that they can expect to face a different and much-improved England side than the one whom they sent crashing out of Euro 2012. The two sides meet in Manaus on Saturday in their opening game of the World Cup, a repeat of their quarter-final clash two years ago in Kiev, in which the Azzurri progressed after a penalty shootout. But Pirlo is not taking the Three Lions' threat lightly, highlighting the emergence of youth within England's ranks, though he is confident that Cesare Prandelli's men are capable of coming out on top. "We know England are a good team that has improved a lot," he told reporters. "They have new, young players, who are fast. We will have to be careful. "However, we know how to face them. Italy have always played great games against England and hence we will have our chances." Pirlo was instrumental in Italy's victory over England in Ukraine, famously completing more passes than Roy Hodgson's entire midfield combined, but he insists that the four-time World Cup winners are more than a one-man team. "This national team is not Pirlo-dependent," the 35-year-old argued. "In order to go all the way you need everyone's contribution. "Our aim should be to win and go until the end. We have a very competitive team and we will give our all to win this tournament. I never compete to take part but to finish first."	sports

I want to replicate PSG success with Milan - Menez - Goal.com	The France international says Pippo Inzaghi's outfit have the ability in their squad to challenge at the top again following a difficult 2013-14 campaign Jeremy Menez says he wants to have the same success with AC Milan that he enjoyed with Paris Saint-Germain. The France international joined PSG from Roma in 2011 and has since won two consecutive Ligue 1 titles and reached the Champions League quarter-finals in each of the last two seasons. The 27-year-old attacker arrived in Italy on Wednesday to undergo a medical ahead of his proposed move to the San Siro giants, and told reporters he is keen to repeat his experiences in the French capital upon donning the Milan shirt. "I'm very happy, I want to win with this shirt as I did with PSG," he admitted after landing in Lombardy. "Why Milan? Because it's a big team, not just a big club. I really hope to do well." Menez returns to Italy to become new coach Filippo Inzaghi's first signing as the club attempt to put a disappointing 2013-14 campaign behind them. But having previously spent three years with Roma before his transfer to Paris three years ago, he insists that he will show on the field of play just how his game has progressed since his last spell in Serie A. "Differences between this Menez and the old one? You will see on the pitch. Compared to four years ago, I have grown a lot and I want to prove it on the field." Menez spent Wednesday evening dining with Milan CEO Adriano Galliani and will undergo a medical at the club's Milanello complex on Thursday ahead of signing a €4.5 million-a-year, three-year deal.	sports

England can't handle the World Cup pressure, says Vialli - Goal.com	The former Chelsea player and manager feels that the Three Lions have a habit of crumbling at major tournaments, though he acknowledges that they could pose Italy problems Gianluca Vialli believes Italy will handle the pressure of the World Cup better than Group D rivals England. The 49-year-old, who was at Chelsea for four years before later managing Watford, thinks that players who do well in the Premier League find it hard to cope with the expectation at major international tournaments. With the Azzurri first up for the Three Lions in Manaus on Saturday, Vialli is confident that his nation will be in better shape, claiming that they "eat pressure for breakfast". He told Perform: "I think it's quite funny with England because, for about four years, all the England fans and the England players feel a bit depressed and disillusioned when it comes to the England side and then, one month before the World Cup starts, everybody sort of starts feeling that they [will] naturally win it and everybody feels super-confident. "I think that England fans should try to find a balance in between both state of minds but I think the England players find it quite difficult when they play in the World Cup because they are not used to the pressure. "When they play in the Premiership, when they play Manchester United versus Chelsea, for example, or Arsenal, there's no pressure; it's actually quite fun to play. "You know that there are no consequences if you don't do well, as long as you do your best on the pitch, and therefore, when they play for the national team, when they wear the England shirt, all of a sudden they realise they are representing their country. They feel there is a massive expectation, there's a lot of scrutiny and a lot of consequences. "It's the inability to handle the pressure that makes a big difference between between the Italian players and the England players when it comes to the World Cup stage. "The Italian players, they eat pressure for breakfast so they grow up with a lot of pressure and they know how to handle it. "Also [Italy] are very good at winning games even though we are not playing at our best, which is something that England players need to learn quite fast if they want to succeed in the World Cup because there will be one or two games where you will not be performing so you need to be able to win it anyway. Historically we are very good at that." Although Vialli is not convinced by England's ability to perform under intense pressure, he acknowledges that they are more than capable of posing a threat on Saturday. "I think England are a very exciting side because they have got so many young, talented, creative players playing up front," he added. "The likes of [Daniel] Sturridge, [Wayne] Rooney, and [Raheem] Sterling, [Adam] Lallana, [Danny] Welbeck, they can turn hot quickly and can create problems for the opposition. "They need to be a bit more clinical, though, because there won't be many goalscoring opportunities so they need to take their chances when they can."	sports

Beating Brazil in the final would be like an orgasm, says Maradona - Goal.com	The 53-year-old says he would love to see his country beat their South American rivals in the final and told Pele to go 'back to the museum' Argentina legend Diego Maradona claims that beating hosts and bitter rivals Brazil in the World Cup final would be "like an orgasm". Maradona, who famously helped guide his country to World Cup glory in 1986, believes Alejandro Sabella's men should be aiming to at least reach the final at Maracana on July 13.  Both Argentina and Brazil are among the tournament favourites, but Sabella's side will first have to escape Group F, which also contains debutants Bosnia-Herzegovina, Iran and Nigeria. If Argentina were to reach the final and subsequently pip five-time world champions Brazil to the title, Maradona has no doubts that it would be the perfect victory. The 53-year-old told Diario Ole: "Hopefully they can do it [reach the final]. The target will be to reach that point. "There, Argentina can open up against Brazil, who will surely be in the final. To beat Brazil in the final would be like an orgasm." The former Barcelona and Napoli star also continued his long-standing feud with Brazil legend Pele before dismissing comparisons between Neymar and Lionel Messi. "How have I been received in Brazil? Better than Pele, although that is not saying much," he continued. "You can tell Pele to go back to the museum. It's clear that the distance between Messi and Neymar is the same between Maradona and Pele. "Neymar is today's Pele. In Brazil he is bigger, everyone is looking to him as the great figure of Brazilian football." Maradona also believes Messi will be able to hit his best form for Argentina this year, something he hasn't done at a major international tournament as of yet. "If an individual inspires the team with his brilliance, it helps immensely," he wrote in Times of India. "That is why I believe the presence of Messi and Ronaldo will help Argentina and Portugal play better. "These two are the best of this generation and both are yet to play at the best of their abilities in the biggest tournament."	sports

Italy playmaker Andrea Pirlo confident ahead of England World Cup 2014 clash - Telegraph	It is little wonder, then, that there is talk of Hodgson specifically adapting his formation to deal with the unique threat of a playmaker who operates so far behind the main striker. Pirlo is confident that the Italian midfield will simply use their movement to ensure that any man-marking strategy would be doomed to failure. Italy tested out a 4-1-3-1-1 formation during their training session on Wednesday and have been constantly tweaking their system during the build-up matches. Daniele De Rossi and Marco Verratti are expected to start but the one certainty is that manager Cesare Prandelli will give Pirlo the freedom to influence the game however he sees fit. “We tried this new solution with a midfielder in front of the defence and two further forward with more freedom,” said Pirlo. “We aim to rotate the midfield positions to keep our opponents guessing. "We like this option, it can give great results and we are working to improve every day. We can try many different approaches but it is also down to how you interpret the role. In truth it’s a system that involves rotation, as we go forward and at other times I’d come back into the more classic position.” Italy’s form in the warm-up matches will have prompted few alarm bells with England. True, they found their goalscoring touch in dispatching Fluminense 5-3 on Sunday but were winless in six previously during a sequence that even included an embarrassing 1-1 draw with Luxembourg. Pirlo was part of the Italy team that won the 2006 World Cup and he is still adamant that a repeat is possible. He also dismissed questions about his own elite status and the suggestion that Italy had become dependent upon him. “I was never interested in being a world star,” he said. “I think about enjoying - you journalists make the world stars. No. We are 23 players at the disposal of the coach and know to go all the way we need a contribution from everyone, as we learned in 2006. “Can Italy win the World Cup? Of course. When I play, it is solely to win. I am never just content with getting through the round. We have a competitive squad and will give our all to achieve this objective. We have the chance to make this a World Cup to be remembered for all our lives. We have what it takes to go far. The important thing is to believe, sacrifice ourselves, work hard and the results can arrive.” That process begins on Saturday, with Pirlo hinting that he could yet renege on a previous plan to retire from international football after this World Cup. At 35, his hunger to keep playing in club football was underlined on Wednesday by confirmation of a new two-year contract at Juventus. “I intend to quit international football after this World Cup but if I am needed...” said Pirlo. “I am still thinking of retiring, as I have a certain age and it’s only right to leave the field to the next generation coming through. It would be pointless to continue. “If I am needed, then there’s no problem in coming back. But if I come on international duty and don’t play, then I’d get angry. So it’s perhaps better I stay home.” It was a mercurial answer but typical of the one player who adds fantasy to an Italy team that still lack a certain flair. In his recent autobiography, Pirlo made a point of acknowledging how Juninho Pernambucano had inspired his free-kick technique and the former Brazil midfielder was even a guest on Wednesday at Casa Azzurri. “Pirlo is a demon, he not only copied my shot but improved it - if I was still playing I’d ask him to teach me,” said Juninho. Pirlo digested the compliment, gratefully accepted a Brazil shirt with his name on it and then delivered an even better sound-bite of his own. “Juninho was very kind to me, we were both emotional,” he said. “I’m Italian, but I’m also part Brazilian - Pirlinho, if you like.”	sports
Neymar: I had a Ronaldo haircut in 2002 - Goal.com	Il Fenomeno made headlines for his appearance as much as his on-field heroics in Japan and South Korea, but the Barcelona star admits he mimicked the look of his idol By Kris Voakes in Sao Paulo Neymar has revealed he sported the same outrageous hairstyle as Ronaldo during Brazil's triumphant 2002 World Cup campaign. Ronaldo notched eight goals - including two in the final against Germany - to finish clear at the top of the scoring charts in Japan and South Korea, but made as many headlines for his appearance as his on-field heroics. The former Real Madrid striker shaved off all his hair except a section at the front, with the look since regularly topping lists of the worst haircuts in football history. But Neymar admits his admiration for Il Fenomeno prompted him to follow suit during the tournament, even though he claims he has forgotten most of the context of Brazil's fifth World Cup victory. "In 2002, I had a haircut like Ronaldo's but I don't remember much," he told reporters at a press conference in Sao Paulo ahead of Thursday's tournament opener against Croatia. "I remember celebrating. "Romario and Ronaldo are the two star players that I always think of when we talk about World Cups, especially 2002. "I get inspiration from all players all over the world, players like Messi and Ronaldo, but I hope to follow my path together with my team."	sports

Wayne Rooney says he has no excuses with England at World Cup 2014 - Telegraph	“Maybe you guys, the media, have put me under a lot of pressure and I’ve tried to respond to that. This time I haven’t and I’m not going to. I’m going to enjoy it. I’m excited for this tournament. I’m enjoying working with the younger lads and the experienced lads. I really believe we can do well. “I’ve learnt to enjoy this one because I haven’t enjoyed the last ones, they’ve not gone well. All of a sudden you’re looking back and they’ve gone and I didn’t enjoy it. I’m going to make sure I take positive memories from this one. I hope so. I know the last tournaments haven’t gone well for me and, if this one doesn’t, I’ll have no excuses. I’ve prepared well for it.’’ Rooney is certainly better prepared than at the 2010 World Cup when he railed against England fans in Cape Town after their dissent towards a dreadful display against Algeria. “I regret that. It was the heat of the moment and it happened, and you move on. Listen, I’ll do my best for England and I’m sure the fans see that. All fans have favourite players. I’m sure the English Man United fans like me! It was stupid of me but it was a frustrating time. “The hardest thing about last time was I missed my family, and this time I’ve learnt to deal with that. Of course I miss them. They’ll be over here eventually. Not with me but they will be. To be honest, it’s good to get a few days’ rest!” Rooney has two sons, aged four and one, and the elder is beginning to note the focus on his father. “For instance, towards the end of last season, when I walked out at Old Trafford the fans were shouting and he was asking why. He’s not a massive football fan. He’s not really into it at the minute. He’s still young. I’m sure, in time, it’ll come.” As well as the maturing effects of fatherhood, Rooney’s equanimity has been helped by talking to the sports psychologist, Dr Steve Peters, who is travelling with England. “I’ve spoken to him a few times. He’s a great benefit for the team. I found him great and easy to talk to.’’ The tournament he enjoyed most was Euro 2004 when he was a teenager, playing without fear, just loving the occasion. “I did enjoy that one. I was doing well. That’s the good thing about the younger lads in the squad, like Ross [Barkley] and Raheem (Sterling). You can see that there’s no fear with them. They’ll be good players, big players for us.” He will tell them to “enjoy it”, adding “You have to enjoy the moment”. Against Ecuador in the Miami friendly, when the focus was on him after injury and some travails in front of goal, Rooney celebrated wildly scoring from three yards. “One yard! I know this is a big tournament for me which I want to do well in, so I was delighted to score. If you look at my record in us qualifying for this World Cup, I had a pretty good record. I hadn’t done too well in the friendlies, but when it counted in the qualifiers, it happened. That’s what I have to do again in this tournament.’’ He is currently on 39 goals, 10 short of Sir Bobby Charlton’s England record which he wants to beat. “It would be great,’’ said the 28-year-old. “At my age, I should break that record. I just want to keep playing, keep trying to score. If I can get Sir Bobby’s record it would be a massive achievement. I’d be absolutely delighted. I want to score goals and help England be successful. If I play well, the team will play well. I feel better than I have done for years. I’m ready for this tournament.’’ He did not particularly appreciate the critical comments from his former team-mate, Paul Scholes, about his having peaked as a player. “I don’t agree with it. I’m sure he’s upset a lot of people at Man United because they see me as worthy of signing a new deal at the club, so they obviously have got a different opinion to what Paul has.’’ Unlike Jack Wilshere, another victim of Scholes’s new role as a pugnacious pundit, Rooney has not bothered to contact Scholes. “I’ve never had his phone number and he’s never had mine,’’ said Rooney, giving an insight into how private a person Scholes was at Old Trafford. “He’s been a great player at Man United, probably the best player I’ve ever played with, so I’m not going to knock him as a player, but I don’t agree with his point.” Handling criticism goes with the territory of being England’s most-scrutinised, most high-profile player. “I’ve always responded well in the dressing room if I’m not doing well and if someone is shouting at me. I have no problem with that. You can see some players it really affects them. It’s not something I get concerned with.” At the start of the season, the then United manager David Moyes suggested that Rooney had gone “soft”. The pair discussed this. “He didn’t call me in. I went to see him. He felt I had lost a bit of aggression out of my game – which I was asked to do, by the way. He said he wanted me to find that aggression back. It [his discipline] was blown up after the sending off against Montenegro [in 2011]. Before that my record in terms of discipline and bookings wasn’t that bad. I was asked to stop doing that – stupid tackles. “Maybe I was trying to do too much. I thought about it a lot. It wasn’t really me. Maybe there are times when you have to try and lift the crowd with a tackle, obviously not a stupid one. A run back and tackle can lift the fans and even turn a game round.” His thoughts now turn to Italy on Saturday. In training at Urca yesterday, Rooney played central, having started left against Honduras. “I’m happy to play anywhere,’’ he said. “But if you look at the way we play, it’s not out and out on the left wing. You’re playing more inside, you’re coming inside off the line. Whoever is playing No 10, wide or up top, the manager [Roy Hodgson] gives us the freedom to rotate.’’ He knows the Italians will be a test. “The Italian defenders I’ve played against tend to read the game really well. They put themselves in good positions. But if I’m being honest, when you play a high tempo they’ve struggled. The Italian league is nowhere near the tempo of the Premier League. Even when we played AC Milan, with [Alessandro] Nesta and [Paolo] Maldini the centre-halves, they really struggled when we played a high tempo. If we can do that I am sure we will give them problems.” Rooney believes England have that tempo. “We’ve got a lot of energy, a lot of pace in the team, and if we can pick the right moments we can really hurt teams with the pace and tempo that we can hit them at. But, at international football, you can’t just go out there and attack, attack, attack. We have to be a bit cautious. This is the top end of football and you might get picked off. We have to stick to our plans that we’ve worked on in the last few weeks and pick the right moment.” Italian defenders are also masters at the dark arts of baulking, checking, ensuring strikers are unable to get close to the ball. “They are but everyone is learning that now; 10-15 years ago it was different but with the amount of foreign players in our league now, even English players are learning it now.’’ If England play against Italy as fluidly and intelligently as Rooney spoke yesterday, they might just have a chance. - Paul Hayward: Prepare for a joyous, nerve-shredding, ludicrous drama - Alan Hansen: Brazil were the best team I faced - I bared had a kick - Manaus groundsman: Pitch for England's game is in poor shape	sports

I hope to settle in as quickly as possible."	sports
Scolari: Current Brazil side as good as Ronaldo's 2002 champions - Goal.com	Host nation are well placed to repeat their success in South Korea and Japan, according to their coach, who oversaw the talents of Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and Rivaldo at that event By Kris Voakes at the Arena Corinthians, Sao Paulo Luiz Felipe Scolari says that his Brazil squad are “collectively the same” as the team he led to World Cup victory in 2002. Speaking at the Arena Corinthians, where Brazil will kick-off the 2014 showpiece on Thursday against Croatia, the Selecao coach told the world’s media that his current crop can emulate the Ronaldo-inspired success of 12 years ago. “I would say that this squad and the 2002 squad are collectively the same,” said Scolari. “There was an ability in that squad which helped to change games tactically. “This squad has players that change their games to help the team. For instance, Neymar helps to mark players if it helps the whole team." ‘Big Phil’ added that he feels his troops are ready to fulfil the dreams of the entire host nation. "We want to thank president Dilma Rousseff for her words of support and also the fans from across the country who are backing us. “The time has arrived, we are going together. This is our World Cup.” Scolari has been hit by the deaths of his brother-in-law and nephew in the build-up to the finals beginning, but he says that football has helped him to move forward as the World Cup approaches. “Yes, we have gone through difficult times together, but life goes on,” he added. “We do what we have to do and we go on. Each of us has a path to follow. “I find my strength from working with these players who dedicate themselves every day and are always trying to improve. All this helps us forget the sadness and see the beauty of what is happening around you.” Niko Kovac’s Croatia side are likely to give Brazil a tough test in their opening Group A fixture, and Scolari insists that he is focused entirely on the events of Thursday night. “I'm thinking only of tomorrow, because we have seven steps to take and we cannot jump the first of those steps. “We have prepared well, we are all fit to play, and everything that was planned was excellent… I will sleep well tonight.”	sports
Pirlo: This World Cup will be my last - Goal.com	The midfielder made his international debut 12 years ago but admits he is unlikely to be available for the national team after the tournament in Brazil Andrea Pirlo has admitted he plans to retire from international duty after this World Cup unless he is desperately needed by Italy. The midfielder has been a member of the national team since 2002 and lifted the 2006 World Cup as well as reaching the Euro 2012 final with the Azzurri. After 12 years of service, the 35-year-old is ready to bring an end to his international career unless Cesare Prandelli is struggling for options if he is not available for selection. "I'm still thinking of retiring after this World Cup, as I have reached a certain age and it is only right to leave the pitch to the generation coming through," the Juventus star told reporters. "It would be pointless to continue. If I am needed, then there’s no problem in coming back. If I come on international duty and don’t play, then I’d get angry. It is perhaps better I stay home." Pirlo was then asked about Mario Balotelli and he believes the striker's goal drought will come to an end soon. The Juventus star said: "Strikers score goals, so when they don’t come then perhaps he gets a little upset, but he just needs to focus on playing for the team and then a goal will arrive as a consequence of that. "It is the dream of every player to be at a World Cup in Brazil, the nation of football. It’s not something that happens often, so we have the chance to make this a World Cup to be remembered for all our lives." Italy are without a win in seven matches as they prepare to face Costa Rica, England and Uruguay in the group stage. 	sports
Wayne Rooney says he has no excuses with England at World Cup 2014 - Telegraph	“Maybe you guys, the media, have put me under a lot of pressure and I’ve tried to respond to that. This time I haven’t and I’m not going to. I’m going to enjoy it. I’m excited for this tournament. I’m enjoying working with the younger lads and the experienced lads. I really believe we can do well. “I’ve learnt to enjoy this one because I haven’t enjoyed the last ones, they’ve not gone well. All of a sudden you’re looking back and they’ve gone and I didn’t enjoy it. I’m going to make sure I take positive memories from this one. I hope so. I know the last tournaments haven’t gone well for me and, if this one doesn’t, I’ll have no excuses. I’ve prepared well for it.’’ Rooney is certainly better prepared than at the 2010 World Cup when he railed against England fans in Cape Town after their dissent towards a dreadful display against Algeria. “I regret that. It was the heat of the moment and it happened, and you move on. Listen, I’ll do my best for England and I’m sure the fans see that. All fans have favourite players. I’m sure the English Man United fans like me! It was stupid of me but it was a frustrating time. “The hardest thing about last time was I missed my family, and this time I’ve learnt to deal with that. Of course I miss them. They’ll be over here eventually. Not with me but they will be. To be honest, it’s good to get a few days’ rest!” Rooney has two sons, aged four and one, and the elder is beginning to note the focus on his father. “For instance, towards the end of last season, when I walked out at Old Trafford the fans were shouting and he was asking why. He’s not a massive football fan. He’s not really into it at the minute. He’s still young. I’m sure, in time, it’ll come.” As well as the maturing effects of fatherhood, Rooney’s equanimity has been helped by talking to the sports psychologist, Dr Steve Peters, who is travelling with England. “I’ve spoken to him a few times. He’s a great benefit for the team. I found him great and easy to talk to.’’ The tournament he enjoyed most was Euro 2004 when he was a teenager, playing without fear, just loving the occasion. “I did enjoy that one. I was doing well. That’s the good thing about the younger lads in the squad, like Ross [Barkley] and Raheem (Sterling). You can see that there’s no fear with them. They’ll be good players, big players for us.” He will tell them to “enjoy it”, adding “You have to enjoy the moment”. Against Ecuador in the Miami friendly, when the focus was on him after injury and some travails in front of goal, Rooney celebrated wildly scoring from three yards. “One yard! I know this is a big tournament for me which I want to do well in, so I was delighted to score. If you look at my record in us qualifying for this World Cup, I had a pretty good record. I hadn’t done too well in the friendlies, but when it counted in the qualifiers, it happened. That’s what I have to do again in this tournament.’’ He is currently on 39 goals, 10 short of Sir Bobby Charlton’s England record which he wants to beat. “It would be great,’’ said the 28-year-old. “At my age, I should break that record. I just want to keep playing, keep trying to score. If I can get Sir Bobby’s record it would be a massive achievement. I’d be absolutely delighted. I want to score goals and help England be successful. If I play well, the team will play well. I feel better than I have done for years. I’m ready for this tournament.’’ He did not particularly appreciate the critical comments from his former team-mate, Paul Scholes, about his having peaked as a player. “I don’t agree with it. I’m sure he’s upset a lot of people at Man United because they see me as worthy of signing a new deal at the club, so they obviously have got a different opinion to what Paul has.’’ Unlike Jack Wilshere, another victim of Scholes’s new role as a pugnacious pundit, Rooney has not bothered to contact Scholes. “I’ve never had his phone number and he’s never had mine,’’ said Rooney, giving an insight into how private a person Scholes was at Old Trafford. “He’s been a great player at Man United, probably the best player I’ve ever played with, so I’m not going to knock him as a player, but I don’t agree with his point.” Handling criticism goes with the territory of being England’s most-scrutinised, most high-profile player. “I’ve always responded well in the dressing room if I’m not doing well and if someone is shouting at me. I have no problem with that. You can see some players it really affects them. It’s not something I get concerned with.” At the start of the season, the then United manager David Moyes suggested that Rooney had gone “soft”. The pair discussed this. “He didn’t call me in. I went to see him. He felt I had lost a bit of aggression out of my game – which I was asked to do, by the way. He said he wanted me to find that aggression back. It [his discipline] was blown up after the sending off against Montenegro [in 2011]. Before that my record in terms of discipline and bookings wasn’t that bad. I was asked to stop doing that – stupid tackles. “Maybe I was trying to do too much. I thought about it a lot. It wasn’t really me. Maybe there are times when you have to try and lift the crowd with a tackle, obviously not a stupid one. A run back and tackle can lift the fans and even turn a game round.” His thoughts now turn to Italy on Saturday. In training at Urca yesterday, Rooney played central, having started left against Honduras. “I’m happy to play anywhere,’’ he said. “But if you look at the way we play, it’s not out and out on the left wing. You’re playing more inside, you’re coming inside off the line. Whoever is playing No 10, wide or up top, the manager [Roy Hodgson] gives us the freedom to rotate.’’ He knows the Italians will be a test. “The Italian defenders I’ve played against tend to read the game really well. They put themselves in good positions. But if I’m being honest, when you play a high tempo they’ve struggled. The Italian league is nowhere near the tempo of the Premier League. Even when we played AC Milan, with [Alessandro] Nesta and [Paolo] Maldini the centre-halves, they really struggled when we played a high tempo. If we can do that I am sure we will give them problems.” Rooney believes England have that tempo. “We’ve got a lot of energy, a lot of pace in the team, and if we can pick the right moments we can really hurt teams with the pace and tempo that we can hit them at. But, at international football, you can’t just go out there and attack, attack, attack. We have to be a bit cautious. This is the top end of football and you might get picked off. We have to stick to our plans that we’ve worked on in the last few weeks and pick the right moment.” Italian defenders are also masters at the dark arts of baulking, checking, ensuring strikers are unable to get close to the ball. “They are but everyone is learning that now; 10-15 years ago it was different but with the amount of foreign players in our league now, even English players are learning it now.’’ If England play against Italy as fluidly and intelligently as Rooney spoke yesterday, they might just have a chance. - Paul Hayward: Prepare for a joyous, nerve-shredding, ludicrous drama - Alan Hansen: Brazil were the best team I faced - I bared had a kick - Manaus groundsman: Pitch for England's game is in poor shape	sports
World Cup 2014: Luiz Felipe Scolari tells Brazilians 'this is our time' ahead of Croatia opener - Telegraph	For Scolari, who described himself as a “coach, a father, an uncle, a friend, someone who has to speak a bit harsh” to his players, there was also the personal tragedies of first losing his brother-in-law, in late May, and then, this week, his nephew during the days in the run-up to this match. “Yes we have gone through difficult times together and we know what this means,” Scolari said. “But life goes on and we do what we have to do. And we go on. Each one has a path to follow and I find my strength from working with these players. These players dedicate themselves every day and work. “They are always trying to improve and all this makes us, even when we are feeling sad, forget the sadness and feel the beauty around us. Arriving here at the airport, at the Corinthians stadium, it is a beautiful stadium and we forget the sad aspects and think of the 99 per cent of positive things in our lives.” To Scolari’s left is Neymar, the 22-year-old striker who is his country’s great hope and poster boy for this tournament, who has willingly taken the mythical No 10 Brazil shirt, and who happily says he is prepared to embrace the weight of that expectation. “As Mr Scolari has said the time has arrived that all Brazil and the whole world was waiting for,” Neymar said. “We hope that this last day goes by very quickly. I am anxious of course but I am also extremely happy to be where I am. Many people would like to be here. I have many messages from my friends saying I have achieved their dreams. “The 12th player – or even the main player of the Brazilian squad – are the supporters. We are at home and if the supporters are behind us 100 per cent it will be very difficult to beat Brazil.” There is ambitious hope that the Barcelona striker can surpass both Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo – the two “star players” that Neymar himself admires and draws “inspiration” from – and become this tournament’s outstanding performer. If he does so then surely Brazil will triumph? “I want to be the best player at the World Cup. I don’t want to just be the striker,” Neymar acknowledged. “I want to win the World Cup. That is what I have always dreamt of.” Scolari nodded approvingly as Neymar spoke and in the questioning from Brazilian journalists there was as much a sense of seeking reassurance as any attempt at analysis. “I try to be the coach I always was,” Scolari said as, unsurprisingly, comparisons were drawn between this squad of players and those who won the World Cup with him in Japan 12 years ago. “I always worked this way, I was never a coach in a different manner even if it was a big team or a small team. I think I am a mixture of everything you said – a father, an uncle, a friend, someone who has to speak a bit harsh. I am a football coach the way that most coaches are. You have to have leadership and have to command them and you have to study and define situations and above all take decisions.” Scolari has been decisive. It appears he has ignored demands to change the team that triumphed in last summer’s Confederations Cup, his faith in Oscar and Paulinho, two out-of-sorts Premier League performers, appears unshakeable. “We are ready,” Scolari said. He was convincing.	sports

"You've got to have a great team spirit," he said. "Roman has said himself that there is no point in arguing about who should be number one. "He would be ready to play at any time, but he knows the overall situation. The players are pushing each other to greater things with their performances."	sports

Arsenal have not indicated they want to activate a buy-back clause on Fabregas and the Spaniard is keen to return to the Premier League. Chelsea have been trying to structure a deal to sign Fabregas that would see Arsenal miss out on any payment for him. Arsenal would be due around 50 per cent of any profit Barcelona make on the Spaniard, but a £27m transfer would not be enough to earn the Gunners a sell-on fee.	sports
World Cup 2014: Luiz Felipe Scolari tells Brazilians 'this is our time' ahead of Croatia opener - Telegraph	For Scolari, who described himself as a “coach, a father, an uncle, a friend, someone who has to speak a bit harsh” to his players, there was also the personal tragedies of first losing his brother-in-law, in late May, and then, this week, his nephew during the days in the run-up to this match. “Yes we have gone through difficult times together and we know what this means,” Scolari said. “But life goes on and we do what we have to do. And we go on. Each one has a path to follow and I find my strength from working with these players. These players dedicate themselves every day and work. “They are always trying to improve and all this makes us, even when we are feeling sad, forget the sadness and feel the beauty around us. Arriving here at the airport, at the Corinthians stadium, it is a beautiful stadium and we forget the sad aspects and think of the 99 per cent of positive things in our lives.” To Scolari’s left is Neymar, the 22-year-old striker who is his country’s great hope and poster boy for this tournament, who has willingly taken the mythical No 10 Brazil shirt, and who happily says he is prepared to embrace the weight of that expectation. “As Mr Scolari has said the time has arrived that all Brazil and the whole world was waiting for,” Neymar said. “We hope that this last day goes by very quickly. I am anxious of course but I am also extremely happy to be where I am. Many people would like to be here. I have many messages from my friends saying I have achieved their dreams. “The 12th player – or even the main player of the Brazilian squad – are the supporters. We are at home and if the supporters are behind us 100 per cent it will be very difficult to beat Brazil.” There is ambitious hope that the Barcelona striker can surpass both Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo – the two “star players” that Neymar himself admires and draws “inspiration” from – and become this tournament’s outstanding performer. If he does so then surely Brazil will triumph? “I want to be the best player at the World Cup. I don’t want to just be the striker,” Neymar acknowledged. “I want to win the World Cup. That is what I have always dreamt of.” Scolari nodded approvingly as Neymar spoke and in the questioning from Brazilian journalists there was as much a sense of seeking reassurance as any attempt at analysis. “I try to be the coach I always was,” Scolari said as, unsurprisingly, comparisons were drawn between this squad of players and those who won the World Cup with him in Japan 12 years ago. “I always worked this way, I was never a coach in a different manner even if it was a big team or a small team. I think I am a mixture of everything you said – a father, an uncle, a friend, someone who has to speak a bit harsh. I am a football coach the way that most coaches are. You have to have leadership and have to command them and you have to study and define situations and above all take decisions.” Scolari has been decisive. It appears he has ignored demands to change the team that triumphed in last summer’s Confederations Cup, his faith in Oscar and Paulinho, two out-of-sorts Premier League performers, appears unshakeable. “We are ready,” Scolari said. He was convincing.	sports

Firefighters veto provisional stands at World Cup stadium - Goal.com	The Arena das Dunas site has not passed a safety inspection and is not yet in position to host Friday's opening game between Mexico and Cameroon Brazil’s overdue and over-budget World Cup 2014 preparations have been plunged into further chaos following news that the Arena das Dunas in Natal may not be ready for its opening match of the tournament. Mexico are due to face Cameroon on Friday in what is scheduled to be the first match held at the stadium. While Secopa (Extraordinary Secretary for World Cup Related Subjects) has guaranteed that the stadium is all but finished, the fire department responsible for signing the order of release for the use of the site disagree. According to firefighters, there should have been a safety inspection of the site on Tuesday, but they were not authorised to make their visit, meaning that the stadium is yet to be cleared to host matches. The Arena de Sao Paulo, the stadium scheduled to host the opening game of the tournament between Brazil and Croatia on Thursday, faced similar issues. The Sao Paulo firefighters department refused to sign off on its temporary seating, which led to Fifa recalling a number of sold tickets. Fans that acquired seats in that part of the stadium were forced to exchange their purchased seats for those situated in other areas of the stadium, causing the capacity to fall from around 68,000 to little over 60,000.	sports

Spain v Holland: We want revenge against Spain, says Wesley Sneijder - Telegraph	“It felt very sour. That will always be my rock bottom. “We were so close to penalties and that game was still there, but Iniesta scored just three minutes before the end of the extra time. “It was a shame because we had beaten Brazil in the quarter-final, a night when we turned the whole game. “I scored twice. Two goals, one with my head, and a 1-0 deficit turned into a place in the semi-finals. “You just felt at one point that we were going to win. And then the final against Spain just went wrong.” Spain go into Friday’s fixture as favourites, with Van Gaal’s blend of experience and emerging youngsters expected to face a battle with Chile for the runners-up spot - and a potential second round clash with Brazil. Sneijder insists, however, that Holland can get the positive result they need against Spain to avoid a losing start to the tournament. “This is a big week but it's only one game,” Sneijder said. “We need a result against Spain. That’s the point. “We may not have a top team, but we definitely have a chance to fight hard and we play compact and can switch the ball quickly. We have a chance.” With Guus Hiddink due to replace Manchester United-bound Van Gaal as coach following theWorld Cup, the Dutch team is expected to be rebuilt ahead of Euro 2016 in France. But Sneijder insists he is ready to prove in Brazil his ability to extend his international career to the next World Cup in Russia in 2018. “I’m very proud of my international career,” Sneijder said. “I’m not a captain, but still a leader. “The team spirit is good, much better than two years ago (at Euro 2012) and I will do everything to keep it that way because that is important at a major tournament. I know that from experience. “These are my sixth major finals but I will keep going. You will see me in four years.” Dutch winger Arjen Robben, whose training ground clash with defender Bruno Martins Indi earlier this week hinted at tensions within the squad, echoed Sneijder’s claims that Holland will test Spain by backing Van Gaal’s youngsters to impress in Salvador. “We have a young team, but it is talented,” Robben told Fifa.com. “Experience is important, especially mentally. But on the pitch it is all about playing in the right way, doing what you have to do - and it doesn’t matter if you are 22 or 32. You just have to do what is asked for. “That said, in my opinion Brazil, Argentina, Spain and Germany are the favourites. It will be hard for us because we have to play a very tough group. “Spain are the reigning world and European champions, and two teams from Spain played this season’s Champions League final. That says it all. “Chile also have a very strong team with really good players who want to play in an attacking way. “And Australia are physically strong. We have played a few matches against them and were never able to win. “But our preparations have been going well so far and I’m really happy we are in Brazil now. You can feel the tournament is about to start. “Brazil is one of the greatest football countries in the world - maybe the greatest - so it is fantastic the World Cup has been organised here.”	sports
Croatia star Ivan Rakitic excited by 'dream' Barcelona switch - Goal.com	The Croatia international has expressed his delight as he edges closer to completing a move to Camp Nou from the Europa League winners Sevilla midfielder Ivan Rakitic is revelling in a "dream come true" as he looks set to seal a switch to La Liga giants Barcelona. The 26-year-old is expected to move to Camp Nou after he has represented Croatia at the World Cup, with his performances during Sevilla's Europa League victory last season having caught the eye of several of Europe's biggest clubs. And Rakitic is thrilled to be on the verge of a move to the Catalan outfit, who are looking to rebuild their squad after missing out on the Liga, Champions League and Copa del Rey trophies last season. "I am very happy," Rakitic told Catalan newspaper Sport. "It is a dream come true." Barcelona are believed to have agreed a deal in the region of €20 million for the Croatia international. Rakitic's arrival is expected to hasten the departure of Cesc Fabregas, with Premier League sides Chelsea,  Manchester Unitedand Manchester City all linked with the Spain midfielder's signature. Barcelona appointed Luis Enrique as head coach last month after parting company with Gerardo Martino, who lasted just one season at the helm.	sports

The Dutch lost 1-0 to Spain thanks to an extra-time Andres Iniesta goal at Soccer City in Johannesburg four years ago, after Robben missed what proved to be a pivotal one-on-one with Iker Casillas on the hour mark. But the 30-year-old says he has no regrets and can’t wait for this weekend's big kick-off in Brazil. "A World Cup is always something special and I am very excited to be in Brazil for this one," he told Fifa.com. "South Africa was a really great tournament for me. It was obviously a big disappointment we lost the final, but I am still really proud of what we all achieved together at that tournament." The former Chelsea and Real Madrid star went on to say he was confident a young Dutch team can perform at the tournament, but conceded they are not among the favourites. "Experience is important, especially mentally. But on the pitch it is all about playing in the right way, doing what you have to do - and it doesn’t matter if you are 22 or 32.

World Cup 2014: Sepp Blatter’s big idea: let managers put referees on the spot - Telegraph	That brought a smattering of applause, but not from members of Uefa, who queued up on Tuesday to tell Blatter to stand down. The revolt, led in part by Football Association chairman Greg Dyke, was branded by Blatter as “the most disrespectful thing I’ve experienced in my entire life”. Yet, it will not stop him clinging on to power, which he could do indefinitely after member associations voted against the principle of term limits being introduced for presidents and other executives. As well as calling for greater use of technology, Blatter even floated the idea of Fifa taking football to other planets. With not a whiff of irony considering the storm over its decision to award the 2022 tournament to Qatar, the Swiss said: “We shall wonder if one day our game is played on another planet? Why not? Then we will have not only a World Cup we will have interplanetary competitions.” The Qatar vote is being looked into by Fifa’s chief investigator, who on Wednesday night vowed to examine evidence published by the British media in recent weeks before filing his report into allegations of corruption surrounding the 2010 vote. As revealed by Telegraph Sport on Wednesday, Michael J Garcia has asked The Sunday Times to provide him with the documents it obtained, which purportedly relate to Fifa’s controversial decision to hand the tournament to the Gulf State. Blatter this week claimed the investigations spearheaded by the Telegraph as being motivated by “racism”, an outburst that saw him taken to task by Dyke. Garcia promised to take them seriously, despite concluding his own inquiries on Monday. The American said: “What we can do, and what we have done, including in response to recent reports, is request any materials others have that they believe would assist in our inquiry.” Insisting he would produce a “comprehensive” report – expected late next month – he added: “What we cannot do and what I will not do is postpone indefinitely completing our work on the possibility someone may publish something we may not have seen.” The head of the investigatory chamber of Fifa’s ethics committee also warned that anyone who failed to cooperate with his investigation faced punishment. That could spell trouble for former executive committee member Franz Beckenbauer, the Germany legend who voted in 2010 but refused to meet with Garcia. The barrage of criticism aimed at Fifa over what Blatter dubbed “Qatartgate” continued on Wednesday when former FA chairman Lord Triesman accused it of acting like a “mafia family”. Triesman, the initial chairman of England’s doomed bid to host the 2018 World Cup who previously claimed four Fifa members sought bribes in return for votes said: “Fifa, I’m afraid, behaves like a mafia family.” He added of Blatter’s racism accusations: “Don Corleone, I believe, would have recognised the tactics and he probably would have admired them.” More accusations of “racism” were levelled at the British media at congress on Wednesday by the head of the Congolese FA. There was also some shameless plugging of Fifa’s €23 million motion picture, United Passions, while Fifa announced plans to pay out £120 million in total bonuses to its national associations and confederations from its World Cup revenue of an estimated £2.7 billion. Each of the 209 member countries will get £150,000 this month and should receive a further £300,000 early next year. The six continental bodies will get £1.5 million this month and should receive £2.7 million more next year.	sports

World Cup 2014: Prepare for joyous, nerve-shredding, ludicrous drama as Brazil's carnival begins - Telegraph	This is a World Cup that cannot shimmy around the problems of Brazilian life and society but still strives for what Socrates called “the ludicrous and joyous” drama of football between nations, watched by the world, in a narrative as broad and strong as the Amazon, which England will fly along to face Italy in Manaus on Saturday. Brazil are threatened on all sides by rich European countries who plunder their best players as well as their old enemy to the south, Argentina, plus the former colonial master – Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal. Ronaldo showed no sign of injury in Portugal’s 5-1 friendly win over the Republic of Ireland, and is now said to be billeted in a VIP suite where he can contemplate his private battle against Lionel Messi, whose vomiting problem has been the source of much curiosity. Messi, now 26, doubled-up again shortly after coming on in Argentina’s last warm-up match and has thrown-up half a dozen times for club and country. “Nerves,” says Argentina’s coach Alejandro Sabella, whose forward line is the most potent at this World Cup. “I reckon that in these moments there is anxiety more than anything. It’s difficult to remain calm.” The Ronaldo-Messi struggle for supremacy was not meant to be described in such malodorous terms, but at least Messi’s nausea tells us that today’s one-man corporations still care about their work. Neymar, who now wears the sacred No 10 for Brazil, has these two to cope with on top of his country’s expectations. Wayne Rooney, who was once compared to Pele by Sven-Goran Eriksson in one of his giddier moments, is another with a sword of judgment poised over his head. In two World Cups, Messi has scored only once, in a 6-0 win over Serbia in 2006, and the heat is on him to convert brilliance at Barcelona into something resembling Diego Maradona’s majesty with Argentina. He is not without accomplices in this cross-border raid. Across the forward line Sabella can call on Gonzalo Higuaín, Sergio Agüero, Ezequiel Lavezzi and Ángel Di Maria, none of which is good news for Bosnia (the debutants), Iran or Nigeria, who make up Group F. These are not the only A-list strikers, but some are struggling for fitness as their opening games approach. Uruguay’s Luis Suárez and Spain’s Diego Costa are among those walking the fine line between recovery and further breakdown. Suárez, the Premier League’s player of the year, underwent arthroscopic surgery on May 22 and trained on his own on Tuesday. Costa, from Lagarto in Brazil, was granted Spanish citizenship last year and could be in for a lively reception from the home crowds. The day before England play Italy on a pitch that looks in photographs like a jungle landing strip, the world and European champions Spain stage a rematch of the 2010 'karate’ final in Johannesburg, which Spain won at the expense of Holland, managed by Manchester United’s autocrat in waiting, Louis van Gaal. Spain hunt a double double. They captured the 2008 and 2012 European Championships either side of their World Cup victory in South Africa, from which 16 members of the squad survive. Spain are foremost among those teams hoping to overturn the reality that all South American World Cups have been won by South American teams. Spain’s dominance of world football can be seen as a victory over the Brazilian talent production machine, to the extent that Scolari’s men all spoke of a huge psychological boost with their Confederations Cup win over Vicente del Bosque’s team here last summer. Even Pele’s country had fallen prey to the notion of Spanish invincibility. Now this tournament offers a chance to restore their No 1 position after a six-year pageant of tiki‑taka-based play. This opening fixture is a chance to take almost sadistic pleasure in the sight of 23 footballers in the beautiful buttercup shirts of their land carry the hopes of 200 million Brazilians, with Neymar the dream catcher in chief. Carlos Alberto Parreira, coach of the 1994‑winning team in America, told reporters that the 22-year-old Neymar’s status as Brazil’s to craque (star) has piled pressure on the team’s poster boy. “A craque can make a difference from one move to another, but it’s the team that wins,” said Parreira, who is now Brazil’s technical director. “Like Maradona, Romario, Pele and all the players who made stand-out World Cup performances, he’ll win with a team behind him.” No host team meanwhile have ever lost an opening match. Brazil lift the World Cup curtain for the first time since their 2-1 win over Scotland at the Stade de France in 1998 and are closing in on La Hexa (a sixth win), two years before the 2016 Olympics drop another spaceship on the Brazilian economy, already reeling from the likely $12 billion cost of staging this event. This week the Brazilian business magazine Isto E Dinheiro called Scolari the “chief executive of the sixth world title”, as if this World Cup were a commercial takeover rather than a hard-fought competition. Before the ball rolls off the centre circle at the mostly-finished stadium in Sao Paulo, Brazil is trapped between the old sense of entitlement and a blazing urge to reject Fifa and its own government’s extravagance. “This is the strangest atmosphere I’ve ever witnessed in Brazil before a World Cup, as apprehension and apathy threaten the normal excitement,” the historian Antonio Risério told The New York Times, who also reported that only 34 per cent of Brazilians think the economy will be improved by the four-week party. Arnaldo Bloch, a columnist with O Globo, wrote: “That talk about the national team being the patrimony of Brazil, the affirmation of our identity and civility and cordiality – no one swallows that anymore.” But football is an opiate that usually finds a route round the body. As the marvellous Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano observed of the old culture: “Brazil has the most beautiful game in the world, made of hip feints, undulations of the torso and legs in flight, all of which came from capoeira, the warrior dance of black slaves, and from the joyful dances of big city slums. There are no right angles in Brazilian football, just as there are none in the Rio mountains.” Who will not look for surviving evidence of this culture when Thiago Silva leads the hosts up the tunnel here in Sao Paulo? However England fare against Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica, English viewers will have little difficulty identifying with Scolari’s outfit. A former Chelsea manager himself, he summoned six Premier League players, as well as Julio Cesar, the goalkeeper recently at Queens Park Rangers. David Luiz, Oscar, Ramires and Willian from Chelsea join Manchester City’s Fernandinho and Paulinho of Spurs in Brazil’s 23-man home guard. This pattern is repeated across the tournament, where 110 Premier League players will represent 26 of the 32 countries. Only Burnley and West Ham United from England’s top flight are without a single player in Brazil. Chelsea lead the way with 17. Beaten in the last World Cup quarter-finals by France (2006) and Holland (2010), Brazil seek their first win since 2002 in Yokohama, when the three Rs of Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho overwhelmed a Germany side now under intense pressure to convert promise into hard metal. Ronaldo’s goalscoring record is under threat from Germany’s Miroslav Klose, a functional finisher by comparison, who needs one more to match the Brazilian Ronaldo’s 15. Others edge towards landmarks. Span’s Iker Casillas has kept seven clean sheets in 15 World Cup finals matches and is three shy of the record of 10 held by Peter Shilton and Fabien Barthez. With one more blockade, Casillas will also pass Walter Zenga’s 1990 record of 517 minutes unbeaten. Algeria seek to avoid a place in history rather than grab one. Failure to score against Belgium in Belo Horizonte would render them the first country to go six successive World Cup games without a goal. At the other end of the glamour scale, Jürgen Klinsmann (the US coach) and Didier Deschamps (France) endeavour to join Brazil’s Mario Zagallo and Germany’s Franz Beckenbauer as the only men to have won World Cups as a player and a manager. Only Vittori Pozzo has won two trophies as a coach (with Italy in 1934 and 1938). Scolari or Del Bosque could take equal rank in the final in Rio de Janeiro on July 13. Despite all their talent and player development system, Germany have not won a trophy since Euro 96 in England. They were runners-up at Euro 2008 and third in the 2006 and 2010 World Cups. At Euro 2012 they were undone by Italy and Mario Balotelli in a game that was seen by many as a near-formality for the Nationalmannschaft. Five days before their game with Portugal in Salvador, Germany were embroiled in a row with 11 locals in the Santo Andre community over excessive security near their base. “We had wanted to ride by bike to our training ground everyday, but unfortunately this is not possible, because the police don’t allow it,” Oliver Bierhoff, Germany’s team manager, complained. The numbers say that in World Cup history 76 teams have played 772 games involving 6,598 players in 19 runnings of the event. This 20th staging lifts Brazil out of the sepia of 1950 and asks huge questions of the country’s infrastructure, government, economy and treatment of its own people, who have plenty of justifications for their grievances. Fifa announced on the eve of the opening ceremony that its 209 national member associations and six regional confederations will be paid bonuses totalling $200 million (£119 million) as revenue projections for Brazil 2014 shot up from $3.8 billion (£2.3 billion) to $4.5 billion (£2.7 billion). These hands‑outs are 40 per cent higher than in South Africa four years ago. Lord Triesman, the former Football Association chairman, alleged: “Fifa, I’m afraid, behaves like a mafia family. It has a decades-long tradition of bribes, bungs and corruption.” Brazil’s president Dilma Rousseff, tortured by the military junta in the early 1970s, portrayed her country as one striving for greater fairness. “I’m certain visitors will mix with a happy, generous and hospitable people, and be impressed by a nation full of natural beauty and which fights each day to become more equal,” she said. There are other kinds of fighting, too. In the first reported case of fan-on-fan violence, an Argentine supporter’s finger was broken when three Brazilians tried to rip a flag from his hands in Belo Horizonte. At a dream final of Argentina v Brazil just over four weeks from now, the chap with the broken finger can gain his revenge, especially if Messi can become the king of his continent ahead of Neymar. - Wayne Rooney: This time I have no excuses for failing to perform - Alan Hansen: Brazil were the best team I faced - I bared had a kick - Manaus groundsman: Pitch for England's game is in poor shape	sports

World Cup 2014: Sepp Blatter’s big idea: let managers put referees on the spot - Telegraph	That brought a smattering of applause, but not from members of Uefa, who queued up on Tuesday to tell Blatter to stand down. The revolt, led in part by Football Association chairman Greg Dyke, was branded by Blatter as “the most disrespectful thing I’ve experienced in my entire life”. Yet, it will not stop him clinging on to power, which he could do indefinitely after member associations voted against the principle of term limits being introduced for presidents and other executives. As well as calling for greater use of technology, Blatter even floated the idea of Fifa taking football to other planets. With not a whiff of irony considering the storm over its decision to award the 2022 tournament to Qatar, the Swiss said: “We shall wonder if one day our game is played on another planet? Why not? Then we will have not only a World Cup we will have interplanetary competitions.” The Qatar vote is being looked into by Fifa’s chief investigator, who on Wednesday night vowed to examine evidence published by the British media in recent weeks before filing his report into allegations of corruption surrounding the 2010 vote. As revealed by Telegraph Sport on Wednesday, Michael J Garcia has asked The Sunday Times to provide him with the documents it obtained, which purportedly relate to Fifa’s controversial decision to hand the tournament to the Gulf State. Blatter this week claimed the investigations spearheaded by the Telegraph as being motivated by “racism”, an outburst that saw him taken to task by Dyke. Garcia promised to take them seriously, despite concluding his own inquiries on Monday. The American said: “What we can do, and what we have done, including in response to recent reports, is request any materials others have that they believe would assist in our inquiry.” Insisting he would produce a “comprehensive” report – expected late next month – he added: “What we cannot do and what I will not do is postpone indefinitely completing our work on the possibility someone may publish something we may not have seen.” The head of the investigatory chamber of Fifa’s ethics committee also warned that anyone who failed to cooperate with his investigation faced punishment. That could spell trouble for former executive committee member Franz Beckenbauer, the Germany legend who voted in 2010 but refused to meet with Garcia. The barrage of criticism aimed at Fifa over what Blatter dubbed “Qatartgate” continued on Wednesday when former FA chairman Lord Triesman accused it of acting like a “mafia family”. Triesman, the initial chairman of England’s doomed bid to host the 2018 World Cup who previously claimed four Fifa members sought bribes in return for votes said: “Fifa, I’m afraid, behaves like a mafia family.” He added of Blatter’s racism accusations: “Don Corleone, I believe, would have recognised the tactics and he probably would have admired them.” More accusations of “racism” were levelled at the British media at congress on Wednesday by the head of the Congolese FA. There was also some shameless plugging of Fifa’s €23 million motion picture, United Passions, while Fifa announced plans to pay out £120 million in total bonuses to its national associations and confederations from its World Cup revenue of an estimated £2.7 billion. Each of the 209 member countries will get £150,000 this month and should receive a further £300,000 early next year. The six continental bodies will get £1.5 million this month and should receive £2.7 million more next year.	sports
Rooney: I have massive role to play for England - Goal.com	The Manchester United star's place in Roy Hodgson's starting XI has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks but he remains adamant he can be integral to the team By Greg Stobart in Rio de Janeiro Wayne Rooney insists he still has a "massive" role to play in an England squad he considers the best he has played in. The Manchester United striker has found his place in the side under scrutiny ahead of Saturday’s World Cup opener against Italy in Manaus, particularly after he was criticised by former team-mate Paul Scholes. Rooney has never scored in eight World Cup appearances but is adamant that he can lead England’s attack in Brazil this summer as an integral part of Roy Hodgson’s youthful squad. “The future is bright, there’s so much ability in the team,” Rooney said in a press conference at England’s training base in Urca. “The younger players are bringing a lot of energy and excitement to the team. It’s probably the best squad I’ve been a part of with England. “It’s a joy to be a part of. I still feel I have a massive role to play in the team.” Rooney revealed that team-mate Danny Welbeck will be fit to face Italy on Satuday despite missing training on Wednesday with a thigh problem sustained on Tuesday. And the 28-year-old reckons Italy should be worried about stopping England in the Amazon jungle, despite the Three Lions’ quarter-finals defeat to the Azzurri on penalties at Euro 2012. “Danny [Welbeck] will be fine, I’m sure he will be ready for Saturday. He’s just not risked anything today. “Italy should be thinking about how to control our team. They have good players but so do we. They should worry about us. “The target is to try and win the tournament. That’s what we’ve prepared to do. It’s obviously a different set up to 2006 and 2010 but the goal is the same, which is to win it.”	sports
Mesut Ozil says Germany want to win World Cup for Joachim Low - Goal.com	The Arsenal midfielder says claiming the trophy would be a fitting tribute to a coach who has revolutionised the national team Germany midfielder Mezut Ozil says he is desperate to win the World Cup for coach Joachim Low. Germany have arrived in Brazil seeking their fourth world title and were handed a tough Group G draw featuring Portugal, Ghana and USA. The former Real Madrid man says he and his team-mates are desperate to claim the crown as a thank you to Low, who Ozil says has revolutionised the national team during his spell in charge. “He's introduced a totally new German national team - one that is really respected all over the world,” Ozil told the official Arsenal club website. “Wherever we go, I think opponents are reluctant to play us because we are very strong. If you look at the German team over the last couple of years, you can see that we have continuously played excellent football.” Low, 54, took charge of the side following World Cup 2006 and finished runners-up at Euro 2008 before making it to the semi-finals of both World Cup 2010 and Euro 2012. And Ozil is keen to go a step further in Brazil this month. “[Low] is one of the best in the world and we're happy to have him around the team. “I hope he will finally be rewarded because in the past we've lost in the semi-finals or final and to lose when you are so close is always sad.”	sports
World Cup 2014: Prepare for joyous, nerve-shredding, ludicrous drama as Brazil's carnival begins - Telegraph	This is a World Cup that cannot shimmy around the problems of Brazilian life and society but still strives for what Socrates called “the ludicrous and joyous” drama of football between nations, watched by the world, in a narrative as broad and strong as the Amazon, which England will fly along to face Italy in Manaus on Saturday. Brazil are threatened on all sides by rich European countries who plunder their best players as well as their old enemy to the south, Argentina, plus the former colonial master – Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal. Ronaldo showed no sign of injury in Portugal’s 5-1 friendly win over the Republic of Ireland, and is now said to be billeted in a VIP suite where he can contemplate his private battle against Lionel Messi, whose vomiting problem has been the source of much curiosity. Messi, now 26, doubled-up again shortly after coming on in Argentina’s last warm-up match and has thrown-up half a dozen times for club and country. “Nerves,” says Argentina’s coach Alejandro Sabella, whose forward line is the most potent at this World Cup. “I reckon that in these moments there is anxiety more than anything. It’s difficult to remain calm.” The Ronaldo-Messi struggle for supremacy was not meant to be described in such malodorous terms, but at least Messi’s nausea tells us that today’s one-man corporations still care about their work. Neymar, who now wears the sacred No 10 for Brazil, has these two to cope with on top of his country’s expectations. Wayne Rooney, who was once compared to Pele by Sven-Goran Eriksson in one of his giddier moments, is another with a sword of judgment poised over his head. In two World Cups, Messi has scored only once, in a 6-0 win over Serbia in 2006, and the heat is on him to convert brilliance at Barcelona into something resembling Diego Maradona’s majesty with Argentina. He is not without accomplices in this cross-border raid. Across the forward line Sabella can call on Gonzalo Higuaín, Sergio Agüero, Ezequiel Lavezzi and Ángel Di Maria, none of which is good news for Bosnia (the debutants), Iran or Nigeria, who make up Group F. These are not the only A-list strikers, but some are struggling for fitness as their opening games approach. Uruguay’s Luis Suárez and Spain’s Diego Costa are among those walking the fine line between recovery and further breakdown. Suárez, the Premier League’s player of the year, underwent arthroscopic surgery on May 22 and trained on his own on Tuesday. Costa, from Lagarto in Brazil, was granted Spanish citizenship last year and could be in for a lively reception from the home crowds. The day before England play Italy on a pitch that looks in photographs like a jungle landing strip, the world and European champions Spain stage a rematch of the 2010 'karate’ final in Johannesburg, which Spain won at the expense of Holland, managed by Manchester United’s autocrat in waiting, Louis van Gaal. Spain hunt a double double. They captured the 2008 and 2012 European Championships either side of their World Cup victory in South Africa, from which 16 members of the squad survive. Spain are foremost among those teams hoping to overturn the reality that all South American World Cups have been won by South American teams. Spain’s dominance of world football can be seen as a victory over the Brazilian talent production machine, to the extent that Scolari’s men all spoke of a huge psychological boost with their Confederations Cup win over Vicente del Bosque’s team here last summer. Even Pele’s country had fallen prey to the notion of Spanish invincibility. Now this tournament offers a chance to restore their No 1 position after a six-year pageant of tiki‑taka-based play. This opening fixture is a chance to take almost sadistic pleasure in the sight of 23 footballers in the beautiful buttercup shirts of their land carry the hopes of 200 million Brazilians, with Neymar the dream catcher in chief. Carlos Alberto Parreira, coach of the 1994‑winning team in America, told reporters that the 22-year-old Neymar’s status as Brazil’s to craque (star) has piled pressure on the team’s poster boy. “A craque can make a difference from one move to another, but it’s the team that wins,” said Parreira, who is now Brazil’s technical director. “Like Maradona, Romario, Pele and all the players who made stand-out World Cup performances, he’ll win with a team behind him.” No host team meanwhile have ever lost an opening match. Brazil lift the World Cup curtain for the first time since their 2-1 win over Scotland at the Stade de France in 1998 and are closing in on La Hexa (a sixth win), two years before the 2016 Olympics drop another spaceship on the Brazilian economy, already reeling from the likely $12 billion cost of staging this event. This week the Brazilian business magazine Isto E Dinheiro called Scolari the “chief executive of the sixth world title”, as if this World Cup were a commercial takeover rather than a hard-fought competition. Before the ball rolls off the centre circle at the mostly-finished stadium in Sao Paulo, Brazil is trapped between the old sense of entitlement and a blazing urge to reject Fifa and its own government’s extravagance. “This is the strangest atmosphere I’ve ever witnessed in Brazil before a World Cup, as apprehension and apathy threaten the normal excitement,” the historian Antonio Risério told The New York Times, who also reported that only 34 per cent of Brazilians think the economy will be improved by the four-week party. Arnaldo Bloch, a columnist with O Globo, wrote: “That talk about the national team being the patrimony of Brazil, the affirmation of our identity and civility and cordiality – no one swallows that anymore.” But football is an opiate that usually finds a route round the body. As the marvellous Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano observed of the old culture: “Brazil has the most beautiful game in the world, made of hip feints, undulations of the torso and legs in flight, all of which came from capoeira, the warrior dance of black slaves, and from the joyful dances of big city slums. There are no right angles in Brazilian football, just as there are none in the Rio mountains.” Who will not look for surviving evidence of this culture when Thiago Silva leads the hosts up the tunnel here in Sao Paulo? However England fare against Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica, English viewers will have little difficulty identifying with Scolari’s outfit. A former Chelsea manager himself, he summoned six Premier League players, as well as Julio Cesar, the goalkeeper recently at Queens Park Rangers. David Luiz, Oscar, Ramires and Willian from Chelsea join Manchester City’s Fernandinho and Paulinho of Spurs in Brazil’s 23-man home guard. This pattern is repeated across the tournament, where 110 Premier League players will represent 26 of the 32 countries. Only Burnley and West Ham United from England’s top flight are without a single player in Brazil. Chelsea lead the way with 17. Beaten in the last World Cup quarter-finals by France (2006) and Holland (2010), Brazil seek their first win since 2002 in Yokohama, when the three Rs of Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho overwhelmed a Germany side now under intense pressure to convert promise into hard metal. Ronaldo’s goalscoring record is under threat from Germany’s Miroslav Klose, a functional finisher by comparison, who needs one more to match the Brazilian Ronaldo’s 15. Others edge towards landmarks. Span’s Iker Casillas has kept seven clean sheets in 15 World Cup finals matches and is three shy of the record of 10 held by Peter Shilton and Fabien Barthez. With one more blockade, Casillas will also pass Walter Zenga’s 1990 record of 517 minutes unbeaten. Algeria seek to avoid a place in history rather than grab one. Failure to score against Belgium in Belo Horizonte would render them the first country to go six successive World Cup games without a goal. At the other end of the glamour scale, Jürgen Klinsmann (the US coach) and Didier Deschamps (France) endeavour to join Brazil’s Mario Zagallo and Germany’s Franz Beckenbauer as the only men to have won World Cups as a player and a manager. Only Vittori Pozzo has won two trophies as a coach (with Italy in 1934 and 1938). Scolari or Del Bosque could take equal rank in the final in Rio de Janeiro on July 13. Despite all their talent and player development system, Germany have not won a trophy since Euro 96 in England. They were runners-up at Euro 2008 and third in the 2006 and 2010 World Cups. At Euro 2012 they were undone by Italy and Mario Balotelli in a game that was seen by many as a near-formality for the Nationalmannschaft. Five days before their game with Portugal in Salvador, Germany were embroiled in a row with 11 locals in the Santo Andre community over excessive security near their base. “We had wanted to ride by bike to our training ground everyday, but unfortunately this is not possible, because the police don’t allow it,” Oliver Bierhoff, Germany’s team manager, complained. The numbers say that in World Cup history 76 teams have played 772 games involving 6,598 players in 19 runnings of the event. This 20th staging lifts Brazil out of the sepia of 1950 and asks huge questions of the country’s infrastructure, government, economy and treatment of its own people, who have plenty of justifications for their grievances. Fifa announced on the eve of the opening ceremony that its 209 national member associations and six regional confederations will be paid bonuses totalling $200 million (£119 million) as revenue projections for Brazil 2014 shot up from $3.8 billion (£2.3 billion) to $4.5 billion (£2.7 billion). These hands‑outs are 40 per cent higher than in South Africa four years ago. Lord Triesman, the former Football Association chairman, alleged: “Fifa, I’m afraid, behaves like a mafia family. It has a decades-long tradition of bribes, bungs and corruption.” Brazil’s president Dilma Rousseff, tortured by the military junta in the early 1970s, portrayed her country as one striving for greater fairness. “I’m certain visitors will mix with a happy, generous and hospitable people, and be impressed by a nation full of natural beauty and which fights each day to become more equal,” she said. There are other kinds of fighting, too. In the first reported case of fan-on-fan violence, an Argentine supporter’s finger was broken when three Brazilians tried to rip a flag from his hands in Belo Horizonte. At a dream final of Argentina v Brazil just over four weeks from now, the chap with the broken finger can gain his revenge, especially if Messi can become the king of his continent ahead of Neymar. - Wayne Rooney: This time I have no excuses for failing to perform - Alan Hansen: Brazil were the best team I faced - I bared had a kick - Manaus groundsman: Pitch for England's game is in poor shape	sports
Manuel Neuer fit for Germany's World Cup opener with Portugal - Goal.com	The Bayern Munich shot stopper has been struggling with a shoulder injury but the goalkeeper coach insists he is fully fit to feature on Monday Manuel Neuer will be fit for Germany's World Cup opener with Portugal, according to goalkeeper coach Andreas Kopke. The Bayern Munich keeper has been struggling with a shoulder injury in recent weeks, but Kopke has allayed any fears that he will miss their Group G fixture on Monday, June 16. "Manuel's going to train fully today so that he can get a feel for his shoulder," Kopke said. "Things are going in the right direction for him. Manuel is experienced enough and we're constantly discussing how his shoulder feels. "It's not the case that he doesn't have faith in it. Manuel is fully fit." Neuer's understudy Roman Weidenfeller played in Germany's last two warm-up games - a 2-2 draw with Cameron and a 6-1 thrashing of Armenia - and Kopke insists there is no problem between the two keepers as they battle it out for the number one jersey. "You've got to have a great team spirit," he said. "Roman has said himself that there is no point in arguing about who should be number one. "He would be ready to play at any time, but he knows the overall situation. The players are pushing each other to greater things with their performances."	sports

With the greatest respect to Bryan, Trevor, Bob and Duncan from BDO [Hearts’ administrators], we are all delighted to see them go! “On a serious note, however, we owe them a huge thank-you for putting in the hours to get us out of administration this week, as promised. “So what now?

Should Hibs move for Murray they will have to pay Dumbarton – whom he steered to fifth place in last season’s Championship, despite sparse resources – compensation for the two-year deal he agreed in May. Murray, who took over in 2012 and led Dumbarton to seventh place the following season, was linked with the St Mirren vacancy when Danny Lennon was sacked, but the Paisley board had already decided to appoint Lennon’s assistant, Tommy Craig. When he signed his new deal with Dumbarton, Murray said: “I’m glad everything’s been sorted and we can get into the planning process for an exciting campaign next season.” However, with two spells as a Hibs player on his CV, it was inevitable that Murray’s name would be touted as a possible successor to Butcher, and one that would be popular with many fans.	sports
Italy playmaker Andrea Pirlo confident ahead of England World Cup 2014 clash - Telegraph	It is little wonder, then, that there is talk of Hodgson specifically adapting his formation to deal with the unique threat of a playmaker who operates so far behind the main striker. Pirlo is confident that the Italian midfield will simply use their movement to ensure that any man-marking strategy would be doomed to failure. Italy tested out a 4-1-3-1-1 formation during their training session on Wednesday and have been constantly tweaking their system during the build-up matches. Daniele De Rossi and Marco Verratti are expected to start but the one certainty is that manager Cesare Prandelli will give Pirlo the freedom to influence the game however he sees fit. “We tried this new solution with a midfielder in front of the defence and two further forward with more freedom,” said Pirlo. “We aim to rotate the midfield positions to keep our opponents guessing. "We like this option, it can give great results and we are working to improve every day. We can try many different approaches but it is also down to how you interpret the role. In truth it’s a system that involves rotation, as we go forward and at other times I’d come back into the more classic position.” Italy’s form in the warm-up matches will have prompted few alarm bells with England. True, they found their goalscoring touch in dispatching Fluminense 5-3 on Sunday but were winless in six previously during a sequence that even included an embarrassing 1-1 draw with Luxembourg. Pirlo was part of the Italy team that won the 2006 World Cup and he is still adamant that a repeat is possible. He also dismissed questions about his own elite status and the suggestion that Italy had become dependent upon him. “I was never interested in being a world star,” he said. “I think about enjoying - you journalists make the world stars. No. We are 23 players at the disposal of the coach and know to go all the way we need a contribution from everyone, as we learned in 2006. “Can Italy win the World Cup? Of course. When I play, it is solely to win. I am never just content with getting through the round. We have a competitive squad and will give our all to achieve this objective. We have the chance to make this a World Cup to be remembered for all our lives. We have what it takes to go far. The important thing is to believe, sacrifice ourselves, work hard and the results can arrive.” That process begins on Saturday, with Pirlo hinting that he could yet renege on a previous plan to retire from international football after this World Cup. At 35, his hunger to keep playing in club football was underlined on Wednesday by confirmation of a new two-year contract at Juventus. “I intend to quit international football after this World Cup but if I am needed...” said Pirlo. “I am still thinking of retiring, as I have a certain age and it’s only right to leave the field to the next generation coming through. It would be pointless to continue. “If I am needed, then there’s no problem in coming back. But if I come on international duty and don’t play, then I’d get angry. So it’s perhaps better I stay home.” It was a mercurial answer but typical of the one player who adds fantasy to an Italy team that still lack a certain flair. In his recent autobiography, Pirlo made a point of acknowledging how Juninho Pernambucano had inspired his free-kick technique and the former Brazil midfielder was even a guest on Wednesday at Casa Azzurri. “Pirlo is a demon, he not only copied my shot but improved it - if I was still playing I’d ask him to teach me,” said Juninho. Pirlo digested the compliment, gratefully accepted a Brazil shirt with his name on it and then delivered an even better sound-bite of his own. “Juninho was very kind to me, we were both emotional,” he said. “I’m Italian, but I’m also part Brazilian - Pirlinho, if you like.”	sports

Safet Susic's side go up against the South American giants in their opening match of Group F at the nation's first ever World Cup.  And despite the prospect of facing the likes of Lionel Messi and Sergio Aguero, playmaker Pjanic is confident that his country can give Argentina a run for their money. "We will be against one of the favourites in Argentina, but we have the expertise to challenge them," he told Sky Sport 24 . "We do not fear anyone because we believe in our chances.

World Cup 2014: Prepare for joyous, nerve-shredding, ludicrous drama as Brazil's carnival begins - Telegraph	This is a World Cup that cannot shimmy around the problems of Brazilian life and society but still strives for what Socrates called “the ludicrous and joyous” drama of football between nations, watched by the world, in a narrative as broad and strong as the Amazon, which England will fly along to face Italy in Manaus on Saturday. Brazil are threatened on all sides by rich European countries who plunder their best players as well as their old enemy to the south, Argentina, plus the former colonial master – Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal. Ronaldo showed no sign of injury in Portugal’s 5-1 friendly win over the Republic of Ireland, and is now said to be billeted in a VIP suite where he can contemplate his private battle against Lionel Messi, whose vomiting problem has been the source of much curiosity. Messi, now 26, doubled-up again shortly after coming on in Argentina’s last warm-up match and has thrown-up half a dozen times for club and country. “Nerves,” says Argentina’s coach Alejandro Sabella, whose forward line is the most potent at this World Cup. “I reckon that in these moments there is anxiety more than anything. It’s difficult to remain calm.” The Ronaldo-Messi struggle for supremacy was not meant to be described in such malodorous terms, but at least Messi’s nausea tells us that today’s one-man corporations still care about their work. Neymar, who now wears the sacred No 10 for Brazil, has these two to cope with on top of his country’s expectations. Wayne Rooney, who was once compared to Pele by Sven-Goran Eriksson in one of his giddier moments, is another with a sword of judgment poised over his head. In two World Cups, Messi has scored only once, in a 6-0 win over Serbia in 2006, and the heat is on him to convert brilliance at Barcelona into something resembling Diego Maradona’s majesty with Argentina. He is not without accomplices in this cross-border raid. Across the forward line Sabella can call on Gonzalo Higuaín, Sergio Agüero, Ezequiel Lavezzi and Ángel Di Maria, none of which is good news for Bosnia (the debutants), Iran or Nigeria, who make up Group F. These are not the only A-list strikers, but some are struggling for fitness as their opening games approach. Uruguay’s Luis Suárez and Spain’s Diego Costa are among those walking the fine line between recovery and further breakdown. Suárez, the Premier League’s player of the year, underwent arthroscopic surgery on May 22 and trained on his own on Tuesday. Costa, from Lagarto in Brazil, was granted Spanish citizenship last year and could be in for a lively reception from the home crowds. The day before England play Italy on a pitch that looks in photographs like a jungle landing strip, the world and European champions Spain stage a rematch of the 2010 'karate’ final in Johannesburg, which Spain won at the expense of Holland, managed by Manchester United’s autocrat in waiting, Louis van Gaal. Spain hunt a double double. They captured the 2008 and 2012 European Championships either side of their World Cup victory in South Africa, from which 16 members of the squad survive. Spain are foremost among those teams hoping to overturn the reality that all South American World Cups have been won by South American teams. Spain’s dominance of world football can be seen as a victory over the Brazilian talent production machine, to the extent that Scolari’s men all spoke of a huge psychological boost with their Confederations Cup win over Vicente del Bosque’s team here last summer. Even Pele’s country had fallen prey to the notion of Spanish invincibility. Now this tournament offers a chance to restore their No 1 position after a six-year pageant of tiki‑taka-based play. This opening fixture is a chance to take almost sadistic pleasure in the sight of 23 footballers in the beautiful buttercup shirts of their land carry the hopes of 200 million Brazilians, with Neymar the dream catcher in chief. Carlos Alberto Parreira, coach of the 1994‑winning team in America, told reporters that the 22-year-old Neymar’s status as Brazil’s to craque (star) has piled pressure on the team’s poster boy. “A craque can make a difference from one move to another, but it’s the team that wins,” said Parreira, who is now Brazil’s technical director. “Like Maradona, Romario, Pele and all the players who made stand-out World Cup performances, he’ll win with a team behind him.” No host team meanwhile have ever lost an opening match. Brazil lift the World Cup curtain for the first time since their 2-1 win over Scotland at the Stade de France in 1998 and are closing in on La Hexa (a sixth win), two years before the 2016 Olympics drop another spaceship on the Brazilian economy, already reeling from the likely $12 billion cost of staging this event. This week the Brazilian business magazine Isto E Dinheiro called Scolari the “chief executive of the sixth world title”, as if this World Cup were a commercial takeover rather than a hard-fought competition. Before the ball rolls off the centre circle at the mostly-finished stadium in Sao Paulo, Brazil is trapped between the old sense of entitlement and a blazing urge to reject Fifa and its own government’s extravagance. “This is the strangest atmosphere I’ve ever witnessed in Brazil before a World Cup, as apprehension and apathy threaten the normal excitement,” the historian Antonio Risério told The New York Times, who also reported that only 34 per cent of Brazilians think the economy will be improved by the four-week party. Arnaldo Bloch, a columnist with O Globo, wrote: “That talk about the national team being the patrimony of Brazil, the affirmation of our identity and civility and cordiality – no one swallows that anymore.” But football is an opiate that usually finds a route round the body. As the marvellous Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano observed of the old culture: “Brazil has the most beautiful game in the world, made of hip feints, undulations of the torso and legs in flight, all of which came from capoeira, the warrior dance of black slaves, and from the joyful dances of big city slums. There are no right angles in Brazilian football, just as there are none in the Rio mountains.” Who will not look for surviving evidence of this culture when Thiago Silva leads the hosts up the tunnel here in Sao Paulo? However England fare against Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica, English viewers will have little difficulty identifying with Scolari’s outfit. A former Chelsea manager himself, he summoned six Premier League players, as well as Julio Cesar, the goalkeeper recently at Queens Park Rangers. David Luiz, Oscar, Ramires and Willian from Chelsea join Manchester City’s Fernandinho and Paulinho of Spurs in Brazil’s 23-man home guard. This pattern is repeated across the tournament, where 110 Premier League players will represent 26 of the 32 countries. Only Burnley and West Ham United from England’s top flight are without a single player in Brazil. Chelsea lead the way with 17. Beaten in the last World Cup quarter-finals by France (2006) and Holland (2010), Brazil seek their first win since 2002 in Yokohama, when the three Rs of Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho overwhelmed a Germany side now under intense pressure to convert promise into hard metal. Ronaldo’s goalscoring record is under threat from Germany’s Miroslav Klose, a functional finisher by comparison, who needs one more to match the Brazilian Ronaldo’s 15. Others edge towards landmarks. Span’s Iker Casillas has kept seven clean sheets in 15 World Cup finals matches and is three shy of the record of 10 held by Peter Shilton and Fabien Barthez. With one more blockade, Casillas will also pass Walter Zenga’s 1990 record of 517 minutes unbeaten. Algeria seek to avoid a place in history rather than grab one. Failure to score against Belgium in Belo Horizonte would render them the first country to go six successive World Cup games without a goal. At the other end of the glamour scale, Jürgen Klinsmann (the US coach) and Didier Deschamps (France) endeavour to join Brazil’s Mario Zagallo and Germany’s Franz Beckenbauer as the only men to have won World Cups as a player and a manager. Only Vittori Pozzo has won two trophies as a coach (with Italy in 1934 and 1938). Scolari or Del Bosque could take equal rank in the final in Rio de Janeiro on July 13. Despite all their talent and player development system, Germany have not won a trophy since Euro 96 in England. They were runners-up at Euro 2008 and third in the 2006 and 2010 World Cups. At Euro 2012 they were undone by Italy and Mario Balotelli in a game that was seen by many as a near-formality for the Nationalmannschaft. Five days before their game with Portugal in Salvador, Germany were embroiled in a row with 11 locals in the Santo Andre community over excessive security near their base. “We had wanted to ride by bike to our training ground everyday, but unfortunately this is not possible, because the police don’t allow it,” Oliver Bierhoff, Germany’s team manager, complained. The numbers say that in World Cup history 76 teams have played 772 games involving 6,598 players in 19 runnings of the event. This 20th staging lifts Brazil out of the sepia of 1950 and asks huge questions of the country’s infrastructure, government, economy and treatment of its own people, who have plenty of justifications for their grievances. Fifa announced on the eve of the opening ceremony that its 209 national member associations and six regional confederations will be paid bonuses totalling $200 million (£119 million) as revenue projections for Brazil 2014 shot up from $3.8 billion (£2.3 billion) to $4.5 billion (£2.7 billion). These hands‑outs are 40 per cent higher than in South Africa four years ago. Lord Triesman, the former Football Association chairman, alleged: “Fifa, I’m afraid, behaves like a mafia family. It has a decades-long tradition of bribes, bungs and corruption.” Brazil’s president Dilma Rousseff, tortured by the military junta in the early 1970s, portrayed her country as one striving for greater fairness. “I’m certain visitors will mix with a happy, generous and hospitable people, and be impressed by a nation full of natural beauty and which fights each day to become more equal,” she said. There are other kinds of fighting, too. In the first reported case of fan-on-fan violence, an Argentine supporter’s finger was broken when three Brazilians tried to rip a flag from his hands in Belo Horizonte. At a dream final of Argentina v Brazil just over four weeks from now, the chap with the broken finger can gain his revenge, especially if Messi can become the king of his continent ahead of Neymar. - Wayne Rooney: This time I have no excuses for failing to perform - Alan Hansen: Brazil were the best team I faced - I bared had a kick - Manaus groundsman: Pitch for England's game is in poor shape	sports
VIDEO: Blatter dances his troubles away - Goal.com	Despite being faced with calls for him to resign, the 78-year-old Swiss took the time to show he still has authority on the dance floor alongside Fernanda Lima The build-up to the 2014 World Cup has been tough for Sepp Blatter, with allegations of corruption rocking Fifa and calls for the Swiss official to stand down amidst concerns over whether Brazil will even be ready for the opening fixtures of the tournament this week. When faced by the media just one day before the competition, however, the 78-year-old seemed decidedly unperturbed, taking time out of his schedule of handing out awards to showcase his dance moves with Brazilian beauty Fernanda Lima. Having also spoken of his desire to see football played in an "inter-platenary competition" in future, Blatter's moves in Brazil were hardly out of this world, but it certainly proved he is willing to embrace the part atmosphere of football's greatest showpiece...	sports
Spain v Holland: We want revenge against Spain, says Wesley Sneijder - Telegraph	“It felt very sour. That will always be my rock bottom. “We were so close to penalties and that game was still there, but Iniesta scored just three minutes before the end of the extra time. “It was a shame because we had beaten Brazil in the quarter-final, a night when we turned the whole game. “I scored twice. Two goals, one with my head, and a 1-0 deficit turned into a place in the semi-finals. “You just felt at one point that we were going to win. And then the final against Spain just went wrong.” Spain go into Friday’s fixture as favourites, with Van Gaal’s blend of experience and emerging youngsters expected to face a battle with Chile for the runners-up spot - and a potential second round clash with Brazil. Sneijder insists, however, that Holland can get the positive result they need against Spain to avoid a losing start to the tournament. “This is a big week but it's only one game,” Sneijder said. “We need a result against Spain. That’s the point. “We may not have a top team, but we definitely have a chance to fight hard and we play compact and can switch the ball quickly. We have a chance.” With Guus Hiddink due to replace Manchester United-bound Van Gaal as coach following theWorld Cup, the Dutch team is expected to be rebuilt ahead of Euro 2016 in France. But Sneijder insists he is ready to prove in Brazil his ability to extend his international career to the next World Cup in Russia in 2018. “I’m very proud of my international career,” Sneijder said. “I’m not a captain, but still a leader. “The team spirit is good, much better than two years ago (at Euro 2012) and I will do everything to keep it that way because that is important at a major tournament. I know that from experience. “These are my sixth major finals but I will keep going. You will see me in four years.” Dutch winger Arjen Robben, whose training ground clash with defender Bruno Martins Indi earlier this week hinted at tensions within the squad, echoed Sneijder’s claims that Holland will test Spain by backing Van Gaal’s youngsters to impress in Salvador. “We have a young team, but it is talented,” Robben told Fifa.com. “Experience is important, especially mentally. But on the pitch it is all about playing in the right way, doing what you have to do - and it doesn’t matter if you are 22 or 32. You just have to do what is asked for. “That said, in my opinion Brazil, Argentina, Spain and Germany are the favourites. It will be hard for us because we have to play a very tough group. “Spain are the reigning world and European champions, and two teams from Spain played this season’s Champions League final. That says it all. “Chile also have a very strong team with really good players who want to play in an attacking way. “And Australia are physically strong. We have played a few matches against them and were never able to win. “But our preparations have been going well so far and I’m really happy we are in Brazil now. You can feel the tournament is about to start. “Brazil is one of the greatest football countries in the world - maybe the greatest - so it is fantastic the World Cup has been organised here.”	sports
Hearts euphoric as club finally exit administration a year after insolvency - Telegraph	Local businesswoman, Ann Budge, who agreed a deal with creditors to buy the club and install Craig Levein as director of football and Robbie Neilson as head coach, used the Hearts website to address the support in excited terms, when she said: “By now, you will all have heard and, yes, it’s true, we have formally exited administration! “Everyone associated with the club is ecstatic and now we can really begin to move ahead in implementing our plans for the future. With the greatest respect to Bryan, Trevor, Bob and Duncan from BDO [Hearts’ administrators], we are all delighted to see them go! “On a serious note, however, we owe them a huge thank-you for putting in the hours to get us out of administration this week, as promised. “So what now? Well, the first thing is to get season tickets on sale as quickly as possible and the club will be issuing information regarding this tomorrow. “Following this, we will shortly be issuing information on new signings and more pre-season friendlies which, I know, is what all the fans are desperate to hear. “However, for today, let’s just celebrate the news!” Meanwhile, at Easter Road, the hunt for a replacement for Butcher has started, with Ian Murray favourite to get the job, despite speculation that the new Hibernian CEO, Leeann Dempster, would turn to Motherwell, the club she left to move to Edinburgh, in pursuit of Stuart McCall. Should Hibs move for Murray they will have to pay Dumbarton – whom he steered to fifth place in last season’s Championship, despite sparse resources – compensation for the two-year deal he agreed in May. Murray, who took over in 2012 and led Dumbarton to seventh place the following season, was linked with the St Mirren vacancy when Danny Lennon was sacked, but the Paisley board had already decided to appoint Lennon’s assistant, Tommy Craig. When he signed his new deal with Dumbarton, Murray said: “I’m glad everything’s been sorted and we can get into the planning process for an exciting campaign next season.” However, with two spells as a Hibs player on his CV, it was inevitable that Murray’s name would be touted as a possible successor to Butcher, and one that would be popular with many fans.	sports

Phil Jones feared for England World Cup place - Goal.com	The England defender took a heavy knock during Manchester United's 3-1 win over Hull in May but was included in Roy Hodgson's squad and is set to play in Brazil England defender Phil Jones has revealed that he feared for his World Cup prospects after injuring a shoulder at the end of last season. The 22-year-old sustained the injury in Manchester United's 3-1 win over Hull City last month, and it was initially feared he could be ruled out of the Brazilian showpiece. However, England boss Roy Hodgson included Jones in his 23-man squad and he played in the pre-tournament friendly against Ecuador last week. And the former Blackburn Rovers man has revealed he breathed a huge sigh of relief when he realised the injury was not going to prevent him from travelling to Brazil. "Once I did it (injured his shoulder) I thought I might not have a chance, but thankfully it healed quickly and I'm feeling fit, ready and I'm so looking forward to it," Jones told the FA's official website. "(The World Cup) was the first thing that came into my mind when I did it. "I remember getting the scan sitting there thinking 'it might knock my chance'. But, thankfully it's healed nicely and I'm able to be a part of what's going to hopefully be a successful tournament." Jones partnered club-mate Chris Smalling at the heart of England's defence in the 2-2 draw with Ecuador, and he was thrilled to get back on the pitch after a month out. "It was nice to get a start, it was a great game, competitive, it was what we wanted and it was great getting 90 minutes under my belt," he added. "It's been great, the lads were all really keen and excited to get out here and now we're here there's a real belief and buzz about the place. "It's building up to the first crucial game of the tournament. There has been an awful lot of work that has gone in behind the scenes which most people don't see. "Everyone is committed, we're in a tight group and everyone's pulling in the right direction for a successful campaign over here."	sports

Chelsea youngster Tomas Kalas joins Koln on loan - Goal.com	The Czech defender made two Premier League appearances for the Blues in 2013-14 but will continue his development at the newly-promoted Bundesliga club Chelsea defender Tomas Kalas will join newly promoted FC Koln on a season-long loan on July 1. The Czech, who has a solitary international cap to his name, spent two seasons on loan at Dutch outfit Vitesse Arnhem before returning to Stamford Bridge for the 2013-14 campaign. After being handed his Chelsea debut as a late substitute in a 2-0 League Cup win at Arsenal in October, Kalas made his European bow in a last-16 home triumph over Galatasaray. Kalas' first start for the club came in the huge 2-0 Premier League victory at Liverpool in April, and he was among the starting XI once again on the last day of the Premier League season at relegated Cardiff City.

Phil Jones feared for England World Cup place - Goal.com	The England defender took a heavy knock during Manchester United's 3-1 win over Hull in May but was included in Roy Hodgson's squad and is set to play in Brazil England defender Phil Jones has revealed that he feared for his World Cup prospects after injuring a shoulder at the end of last season. The 22-year-old sustained the injury in Manchester United's 3-1 win over Hull City last month, and it was initially feared he could be ruled out of the Brazilian showpiece. However, England boss Roy Hodgson included Jones in his 23-man squad and he played in the pre-tournament friendly against Ecuador last week. And the former Blackburn Rovers man has revealed he breathed a huge sigh of relief when he realised the injury was not going to prevent him from travelling to Brazil. "Once I did it (injured his shoulder) I thought I might not have a chance, but thankfully it healed quickly and I'm feeling fit, ready and I'm so looking forward to it," Jones told the FA's official website. "(The World Cup) was the first thing that came into my mind when I did it. "I remember getting the scan sitting there thinking 'it might knock my chance'. But, thankfully it's healed nicely and I'm able to be a part of what's going to hopefully be a successful tournament." Jones partnered club-mate Chris Smalling at the heart of England's defence in the 2-2 draw with Ecuador, and he was thrilled to get back on the pitch after a month out. "It was nice to get a start, it was a great game, competitive, it was what we wanted and it was great getting 90 minutes under my belt," he added. "It's been great, the lads were all really keen and excited to get out here and now we're here there's a real belief and buzz about the place. "It's building up to the first crucial game of the tournament. There has been an awful lot of work that has gone in behind the scenes which most people don't see. "Everyone is committed, we're in a tight group and everyone's pulling in the right direction for a successful campaign over here."	sports

David Luiz reveals five-year deal with PSG - Goal.com	The 27-year-old claims he has agreed to leave Chelsea and play for the French champions for five seasons following this month's World Cup in Brazil Brazil defender David Luiz has revealed he has signed a five-year deal with French champions Paris Saint-Germain. His current club, Chelsea, and PSG both released statements on their official websites last month confirming that a deal  - which Goal understands is worth €50 million - had been agreed. And now the 27-year-old, who is hoping to lead the Selecao to their sixth world title and their first on home soil, has confirmed he will be playing in Ligue 1 for the next five seasons. “I have just signed a deal with PSG for five years,” he told Globo when asked if he intends to one day play in Brazil’s top flight. “I left for Europe when I was 18, I skipped a few steps… We’ll see. What we plan today may not be right tomorrow.” The Selecao’s vice-captain also spoke of the demonstrations seen across the country in protest of public spending for the World Cup. “As long as the demonstrations happen peacefully, I respect them. I do not want to see violence,” he said. “I do not like the vision that Europeans have about our country, that Brazil is bad. Brazil has many things to be great.”	sports

Chelsea youngster Tomas Kalas joins Koln on loan - Goal.com	The Czech defender made two Premier League appearances for the Blues in 2013-14 but will continue his development at the newly-promoted Bundesliga club Chelsea defender Tomas Kalas will join newly promoted FC Koln on a season-long loan on July 1. The Czech, who has a solitary international cap to his name, spent two seasons on loan at Dutch outfit Vitesse Arnhem before returning to Stamford Bridge for the 2013-14 campaign. After being handed his Chelsea debut as a late substitute in a 2-0 League Cup win at Arsenal in October, Kalas made his European bow in a last-16 home triumph over Galatasaray. Kalas' first start for the club came in the huge 2-0 Premier League victory at Liverpool in April, and he was among the starting XI once again on the last day of the Premier League season at relegated Cardiff City. The 21-year-old will now be hoping to pick up more first-team experience as Koln adjust to life back in the Bundesliga, after topping the second tier last term. Kalas arrived at Chelsea from Sigma Olomouc in 2011.	sports

Fifa behaves like mafia family, says Lord Triesman - Goal.com	The former English Football Association chairman has compared the organisation's beleaguered leadership to the Corleone crime family depicted in the Godfather films Fifa behaves like a "mafia family" with a tradition of "bribes, bungs and corruption", according to former English Football Association chairman Lord Triesman. World football's governing body has been rocked by a series of scandals in recent years, most recently allegations published by The Sunday Times newspaper relating to impropriety in Qatar's successful bid to host the 2022 World Cup. Fifa's bullish response to the allegations has led several high-ranking Uefa delegates to call for president Sepp Blatter to step down after 16 years at the head of the organisation. And Triesman, who was FA chairman when England launched its failed bid to host the 2018 World Cup, has launched a scathing public attack on the Fifa leadership, likening it to the Corleone crime family depicted in the Godfather films. "Fifa, I’m afraid, behaves like a mafia family. It has a decades-long tradition of bribes, bungs and corruption," he said during a debate on the Queen's Speech in the House of Lords. "About half of its executive committee who voted on the last World Cup have had to go. "Even its past president Joao Havelange has been removed from his honorary life presidency in his 90s. "Systematic corruption underpinned by non-existent investigations where most of the accused are exempt from the investigation make it impossible to proceed. "Don Corleone, I believe, would have recognised the tactics and he probably would have admired them."	sports

Ghana face anxious wait on injured Abdul Majeed Waris - Goal.com	The striker suffered a torn thigh muscle in the friendly win over South Korea and is a doubt for the World Cup opener against USA on Monday Scans have revealed that Ghana striker Abdul Majeed Waris has a torn quadricep and faces a race against time to be fit for the World Cup. The injury was at first thought to be relatively minor, incurred during the fourth minute of Monday's 4-0 friendly victory over South Korea. "He had a knock on his left thigh," said team doctor Baba Adam. "We initially tried to see if he could go back to play but we realised it was an injury that needed to be taken care of and managed well. "We did an MRI on the quadriceps and what we realised is that, there was a tear. "We hope to get him on to the field again pretty soon. However, we are still monitoring him to the deadline when we will give our final statement on his state of affairs." Waris' absence would be a huge blow after the diminutive attacker played an integral part in Ghana's qualification for Brazil, during which he scored three goals. "The Fifa deadline is (June) 15, so we will monitor until that day and see how things turn up," said Adam before adding that Waris is improving and "can now bend his knee with little pain." Ghana begin their World Cup campaign against the United States on Monday before meeting Germany on June 21 and Portugal on June 26.	sports
Sepp Blatter: I want an interplanetary World Cup - Telegraph	Triesman, the initial chairman of England's doomed bid to host the 2018 World Cup, has previously claimed four Fifa members sought bribes in return for votes. In the light of recent media allegations of corruption in Qatar's successful bid for the 2022 World Cup, Triesman stepped up his attack on the governing body, claiming attempts by Blatter to dismiss the issue was a tactic that would have been approved by movie Godfather Don Corleone. "Fifa, I'm afraid, behaves like a mafia family. It has a decades-long tradition of bribes, bungs and corruption," he said. Speaking during a debate on the Queen's Speech in the House of Lords, Triesman applauded the stand taken by current FA chairman Greg Dyke against the "grotesque" accusation by Blatter that media investigations into corruption at Fifa were racist. He told peers: "Don Corleone, I believe, would have recognised the tactics and he probably would have admired them." Speaking on the eve of the World Cup in Brazil, Blatter also said Fifa must move forward in a changing world in which football had become a "multi-billion dollar" industry with "powerful opportunities". "Our world is changing, our game is changing. Our organisation must also change. It is our duty to keep football going forward. "It is our duty to lead by example and behave like an example, with integrity." Blatter said football's growth "creates powerful opportunities. Sometimes it creates controversial situations and then some difficulty".	sports
The Page That Worries It's In The Minority | Football365 | Mediawatch	Latest Articles Steve Bruce should be England manager because he was a good captain, England have let down Chile, Gary Lineker has done a massive about-turn and more... We made a bit of a boo-boo about Luis Suarez, Oliver Holt asks for a 'tweak' and then calls it a 'gamble' and Neil Ashton wants Hodgson out because he didn't pick James Milner... The Wrong Stuff Given its daily duty, Mediawatch grows adapted to reading the sort of pieces that may make less-accustomed readers fall off their chairs in surprise, anger, sadness or a merry mix of all three. However, the front page of this morning's The Sun contains a quote so entrenched in parody that even we failed to hide our shock. Strap yourselves in. 'The next young player who says he does not want to play for England should be ordered to ring the parents of a soldier who has died serving his country in Afghanistan and tell them his reasons,' is the quote in question from Ian Wright on the paper's FRONT page. Yes, really. A few questions, Ian: 1) Why on earth are you comparing playing football for your country with fighting and losing your life in a war? Football is a place in which priorities are skewed and importance inflated at the best of times, but even Wrighty must see that his equation is deeply flawed? Bill Shankly's memorable epithet regarding the game being "more than a matter of life and death" was intended as a pithy display of just how much football meant to him. It should not be used as a relevant moral compass. Football is not 'just a game', but that only refers to its growth as a commercial entity and potential vehicle for unity, rather than being equatable to the dangers of conflict. 2) What on earth would a player say to soldiers' families? "Hi, is that Mrs Moore?" "Good, I was just calling because I have been 'forced' to explain to you the reasons why I don't want to play in England's next friendly against Latvia" "Oh... Yes I suppose you're right, you probably have got better things to think about. It's just that a columnist in The Sun said..." "Yes, true. He probably was just trying to get a reaction. And you're right, the paper probably did put it on the front page just to sell copies, fully in the knowledge that it would generate a heated reaction. And yes, I guess that is actually quite demeaning to you and your loss. Sorry to have troubled you." 3) Why would these calls to families serve any purpose to either party? Wright's intention is to shame the apparent disrespect displayed by those not wanting to play for England, but in fact only demonstrates incredible insensitivity to the families of those killed in war. Mediawatch doesn't feel like it can or should speak on their behalf, but we're pretty sure that a fringe player choosing not to play for his country's football team fails to even flicker on the radar of those who have suffered such a tragic loss. Comparing those two scenarios only serves to demean such tragedy. Reading The Riot Act The Sun don't stop their campaign of cretinism there though. Oh no. 'Bookworm,' screams the headline on the back page of the paper. 'Dyke's 'Death in Brazil' Blunder,' reads the tagline. Oh goodness, has Football Association chairman Greg Dyke killed a man on Copacabana beach? No, he hasn't. Instead he has been 'caught' reading a book called 'Death in Brazil', a novel by Peter Robb that describes Brazil's multicultural history through the mediums of sex, food and death. It is, Mediawatch has been told, quite brilliant. This disgusting action on Dyke's part is labelled as a 'major blunder' and a 'PR disaster' by The Sun, who describe his decision to read Peter Robb's book as 'capping the end of a nightmare campaign for England.' Finally, the paper claim the incident is 'embarrassing'. Which of course it isn't. But using the back page spread of your paper to criticise a man for reading a book with a particular title is. It really, really is. Where's The Passion, Lads? Mediawatch completed its headache-inducing hat-trick in The Sun with Tony Parsons predictably calling for 'passion' in a piece that might as well be written in the blood of the dragon slayed by St. George. We know Parsons wants 'passion' because the word is in capital letters on the front page of the paper. It's also used in the byline to the piece. It's also capitalised and emboldened on three separate occasions in the piece itself. We've had quite enough of The Sun 's jingoistic bulls**t for one day, so will instead simply let you tick off your World Cup exit fall-out bingo card: 'Where was the fire in the belly?' - Check. 'Where was the blood of Terry Butcher' - Check. 'All guns blazing' - Check. 'Charge of the light brigade' - Check. 'Dunkirk' - Check. 'We could not fight our way out of a paper bag, let alone fight Nazi Germany. We would give Hitler a house and tell him to bring the family' - House. If this is what England wants, we don't want England. Someone pass Mediawatch its passport. Fix You 'Roy: We Need Six Years To Fix It,' farts out the claim on the back page of the Daily Mail. Connoisseurs will spot the lack of speech marks in the headline to a piece written by Neil Ashton. That's key here. Actual quotes from Roy Hodgson: "I'm now giving them the opportunity, not because I can, but because this is a good team and they can go and win the game. I hope they prove me right. "We just hope the next two, four to six years will bring some dividends from this. We are no longer capable of going through, but we're trying to build the confidence." Welcome to the Daily Mail's quote translator, where the England manager explaining the benefit of using young players against Costa Rica because it will give them experience for their future England careers becomes 'We Need Six Years To Fix It'. Why of course. Just Another 'Exclusive' 'EXCLUSIVE: Herrera WILL complete £28m move to United TODAY,' screams the headline on the Daily Mail website. Presumably, 'exclusive' is now short for 'well the Spanish media ran this last night but we've got it too so click here'? The Final Word Mediawatch greatly enjoyed Adrian Durham's list of '10 things the Three Lions boss MUST do ahead of Euro 2016' piece on the Daily Mail website, because there is nothing better than an experienced tactician and manager passing on his wisdom. The expert coach's big ideas include the following pieces of advice. See if you can spot the problem: 'Pick Daniel Sturridge and Rooney as a front pair' 'Flood the midfield by picking Michael Carrick, Jack Wilshere and Steven Gerrard' 'Right now I would suggest that Ross Barkley, Luke Shaw, John Stones and Raheem Sterling are good enough to start for England'. Yes, that's right. From now on England will be playing with Luke Shaw and John Stones as part of a three-man defence with no wing-backs. And you thought Roy Hodgson had been adventurous in Brazil. However, Mediawatch enjoyed no. 6 on Durham's list the most. 'Wilshere loves playing for England... so play him!' is Durham's logic. Yes, forget form, fitness or ability, it's who 'loves' it most that should get in the team. We presume Terry Butcher is the other choice for that three-man defence. 'Have I Just Read That?' Questions Of The Day 'How many fat East Europeans do you see? How many Chinese are on benefits? Where did it all go wrong' - Tony Parsons continues his charm offensive in The Sun. Optimistic Statement Of The Day 'There will be no angry mob, no mood to vilify them - just a general acceptance that we didn't expect much more anyway' - Dave Kidd in the Daily Mirror clearly hasn't read the tabloids over the last few days. For that he should be thankful. Headline Of The Day 'He's For Real' - Nice work from the Daily Mirror on Luis Suarez. Now we're all doing the Ali G voice in our head. Worst Headline Of The Day 'Loot Shaw' - He is going to cost an awful lot of money, but that doesn't excuse such weak punnery from the Daily Mirror. Non-Football Story Of The Day 'A man has had to be rescued by firefighters in Germany after becoming stuck inside a stone vagina. 'The man, who is said to be an American exchange student, got wedged in the statue at Tubingen University. 'According to German newspaper Schwäbisches Tagblatt, five emergency service vehicles and 22 firemen had to help free the man.

Is Anybody Still Defending This Lethal Weapon? | F365 Says	Surely there comes a point when even his greatest Liverpool-supporting defenders put their hands up and admit he's a tool. But he's a tool that they'll probably keep now... Last Updated: 24/06/14 at 20:28 Post Comment Latest Articles Some will demand inquests but is there anything fundamentally wrong with England or are they just a half-decent side who came up narrowly short? The truth is pretty dull... Having been urged to 'give youth a chance' and 'change the shape' before Brazil, Roy Hodgson did exactly that. It's difficult to vilify a man that did what we would do, says Philip Cornwall... It might have been a miserable week on Football365 but battered spirits have been raised by commenters on Monday's otherwise-anodyne gossip column suggesting that a swap deal involving Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi might see Liverpool getting the sticky end of the exchange. Seriously. I'd consider a straight swap, Messi for Suarez would be an acceptable gamble (and it would be a gamble - Messi's relatively poor form this season could be the beginnings of a decline) but I'd rather keep Suarez. Hopefully Suarez meant it when he said he doesn't want to leave and will come out and say it again after the World Cup. That was our favourite comment but there have been others - from those who refuse to believe that Suarez might want to leave Liverpool, just as they refused to believe that he might want to leave Liverpool last summer, refused to believe that he would use racist language and refused to believe that two biting incidents were anything other than coincidence. Now there's a third. As we are struggling to name more than a handful of footballers who have felt the need to sink their teeth into an opposition player once, surely even the Uruguayan's staunchest suppporters have to admit that three times offers pretty compelling evidence that they have been defending the indefensible. We have been told that he has redeemed himself this season by a) scoring a lot of goals and b) not biting or racially abusing anyone, prompting wonderful jokes about Adolf Hitler 'redeeming himself' with that 30-goal season for Sturm Graz. Like the audience who give the guests on Jeremy Kyle a round of applause for finding the strength to stop using the family allowance to buy crack, a lot of gullible people have been fooled - or have chosen to be fooled because, after all, he scores a lot of goals - by a total weapon briefly behaving like a decent human being. There is good news for those deluded Liverpool fans who would turn down Messi for the walking liability that is Suarez: He is now unlikely to join Real Madrid or Barcelona, two clubs who put far too much weight on commercial value to sign a footballer who would turn the stomach of many fans and sponsors. They baulked at signing him last summer after he grazed on Branislav Ivanovic and it's likely that they will baulk at signing him again after he repeated his trick on football's biggest stage. If Suarez had been keeping his nose (and teeth) clean for a year to re-build his reputation and earn himself a move, he has stumbled at the very last hurdle, just 12 or 13 minutes away from the end of his season as Uruguay faced World Cup exit. Such a low level of self-control is extraordinary. There will be those that ignore the video evidence and claim Suarez has been tried on reputation alone, there will those who claim that whatever he does in a Uruguayan shirt is irrelevant and there will be those who find somebody else to blame (the media again, perhaps?) for his indiscretions. But maybe there should also be those who admit that Liverpool only own one of the top five footballers in the world because he is so very, very flawed. Sarah Winterburn	sports
Failure By Fine Margins Teaches Nothing.... | F365 Says	Some will demand inquests but is there anything fundamentally wrong with England or are they just a half-decent side who came up narrowly short? The truth is pretty dull... Last Updated: 24/06/14 at 23:35 Post Comment Latest Articles Surely there comes a point when even his greatest Liverpool-supporting defenders put their hands up and admit he's a tool. But he's a tool that they'll probably keep now... Having been urged to 'give youth a chance' and 'change the shape' before Brazil, Roy Hodgson did exactly that. It's difficult to vilify a man that did what we would do, says Philip Cornwall... If somebody had said two weeks ago that England would end the their Group D campaign having had the most shots (38), allowed the opposition the fewest attempts (25), dribbled past twice as many opposition players (41) as their rivals and had a pass completion rate of 85%, our only question would have been whether that was enough for first place or we would have to settle for a runners-up spot. England have, quite bizarrely, recorded the statistics of a team who have started this World Cup with the form of potential semi-finalists, rather than a team who have ended their sorry sojourn with just one point. Which shows you that a) statistics can sometimes be incredibly misleading and b) England really have failed by fine margins. England are not Spain, the world and European champions who saw their creaking system and players torn apart by Holland and then Chile; they are not Portugal, who have once again been exposed as a one-man band without a tune; they have simply been narrowly beaten twice by teams of very similar strength and then drawn a dead rubber 0-0 after fielding a much-changed side. It's the kind of 'not quite' run that even the greatest teams and the greatest managers will 'suffer' at least once a season. But this is international football and there is no looming run of games where the 'not quite' can quickly become the 'just about'. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with this English team in their tactics, their attitude, their desire; they simply lack a little bit of quality and, in this tournament, a little bit of luck. The difference between England finishing top or bottom of that group were a scuffed shot here, a poor refereeing decision there, a failure to track here, a header an inch too high there. I am no more depressed about this England side on the evening of June 24 as I was on the morning of June 14. It still has the same strengths (attacking players who can run at the opposition, the promise of youth, hard-working wide players) and weaknesses (an average defence, a lack of holding midfielders, no truly world-class player to make the difference in close encounters). It is a side good enough to beat most but rarely good enough to beat the best. It's incredibly lazy to talk about a lack of passion, it's incredibly crass to cite war metaphors, it's incredibly short-sighted to blame the manager, it's incredibly forgetful to blame a foreign influx and it's incredibly boring for the rest of us when club loyalties take over and individual players are cited. The rather dull truth is that England came up narrowly short. Play those games again with the same players and the results may have been different enough to see England through as champions. Play them a third time and we may not score a goal or claim a single point. There are still a handful of reasons to be cheerful and many reasons to be cheerless about England's future - you'll read plenty about the latter in the coming weeks because of what happened in ten pretty unsurprising days in Brazil, but the former will be forgotten for the same reason.

Transfer news: Dinamo Moscow agree deal for Manchester United full-back Alexander Buttner | Football365 | Premier League News	Dinamo Moscow have confirmed that a deal to sign full-back Alexander Buttner from Manchester United has been agreed. Last Updated: 24/06/14 at 15:36 Post Comment Alexander Buttner: Agrees deal to join Dinamo Moscow The 25-year-old only moved to Old Trafford from Dutch side Vitesse in 2012, but as understudy to Patrice Evra he was limited to just 13 Premier League games over the course of two seasons in England. With Evra having signed a new one-year deal and Southampton left-back Luke Shaw also on United’s radar this summer, first-team opportunities for the new season appeared to be slim once again for Buttner. A three-year contract has been agreed to make the switch to the Russian capital and the deal will be finalised once technical details have been ironed out. Buttner told Dinamo’s official website: "I want to play in the Champions League and win trophies. "Dinamo have a very strong team and I believe we can fight for first place this season."	sports

Giving Rio £65,000 A Week. What Could Go Wrong? | Football365 | Opinion | Mailbox	Latest Articles Jack Rodwell can become the player England crave, according to one mailboxer. Others are enjoying Neymar and longing for Jose Mourinho as England boss... It does seem a tad ridiculous. But it will allow Liverpool to build half a team. We have lots of mails on England really not being bad, Henderson for captain and more... If you have anything to say on any subject, mail us at theeditor@football365.com We Got a Few Of These Terry Hall, Switzerland. Jack Rodwell England Captain in 2016? Are you on drugs? James, Ireland Not Wanting England To Win Without wanting to be accused of treason and marched to the front door of a grieving family by Ian Wright, I think a convincing victory for England today could be the worst thing that could happen, and that's not just for the headline 'Costa Eureka!' that will adorn the papers tomorrow. Of course, it makes sense to always have half an eye on the next major tournament, and the expansion to 24 teams in the European Championships means that England should really never fail to qualify for it ever again, but much like any game of football, you should be picking your best players to get the job done. Tonight is a meaningless game for England and I can understand the experimentation, but should they win 3-0, that does not mean this is England's best team. The cry for this massively inexperienced team to carry on into the qualifiers for Euro 2016 will be deafening and I only hope Roy Hodgson has the sense about him to realise that actually, the team he picked for the first two games is, more or less, his best team, even if it wasn't utilised in the best manner. There are question marks of course, and as with any tournament, you would expect a couple of players to be phased out. Wholesale change though is not needed. Wholesale change has already happened in many respects when you look at this squad compared to that of even two years ago. Half the squad has changed already - that's major surgery! Many people seem to be pinning their hopes on the likes of Luke Shaw, who is a very good player but is still very young, and John Stones, who has a handful of impressive games for Everton under his belt. These guys may turn out to be wonderful players, but if they don't break into the England team until they're 22/23, that isn't the end of the world. Seriously, when will we learn? Leighton Baines, despite being 29, is still a relative newcomer to the international scene and deserves a chance to bed in. The same is true of the likes of Lallana, Henderson, Wilshere and even Jagielka and Cahill. Because of the longevity of the previous generation, we have a raft of players in their mid to late twenties with very little international experience. Any good team has the right mix of youth and experience. To throw the likes of Gerrard, Rooney (and dare I say it, Ashley Cole) on the scrap heap too early would be cutting off our nose to spite our face. Italy with Pirlo and Mexico with Marquez have both put extra players in certain areas on their team to allow their older players to continue to flourish, which is something Hodgson has neglected to do. Isn't something along those lines worthy of experimentation as much as filling the team full of kids who have thus far shown no signs of surpassing the people they are being lined up to replace? I think, as a nation, we are sorely mistaken if we think we have players of the quality of Gerrard, Lampard and Rooney coming through our ranks. If it forces us to focus on the collective rather than the individual then it's for the better, but forgive me if I remain sceptical on that one. Andy, London England had The Group Of Death Ever since the WC draw, Group G with Germany/Portugal/USA/Ghana has been dubbed the "group of death". At the time, I couldn't argue. As of December 6, 2013, Ze Germans were ranked 2nd, Portugal 5th, USA 14th and Ghana 24th. 45 total? That's ridiculous! Come the start of the World Cup, however, Despite Germany still being 2nd, Portugal up to 4th and USA up to 13th, Ghana had dropped to 37th. That's a combined total of 56. Uruguay at 7th, Italy at 9th, England at 10th and Costa Rica at 28th gives us a total of 54, the lowest combined ranking of any group. We were 6/7/13/31 for 57 at the time of the draw. I still hold onto some hope that we can beat Costa Rica today and save some face after playing the REAL Group of Death at this year's WC. Dickon, Sandford Send Them All To School With a country of 60 million people, amongst the highest paid players in the world, a smorgasbord of talent, why do we always fail dismally at international competition. To answer this, you must find the unique characteristic of the English footballer. And this is found at the heart, no the arse of this septic isle. The chav. The ignoramus who lionized Jade Goody (God rest her soul), the country that invented binge drinking, the nation with the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in Europe, the 'fan' who whilst not inventing football hooliganism, gave it that English touch; the English footballer is royalty amongst them all. This squad is dumb and getting dumber. Ask yourself how many players speak a foreign language ('Professor' Lampard's latin doesn't count). Most squads are bi-lingual and more. Why has no player in the Premiership come out as Gay, why do none of the squad play abroad? Why does an intelligent guy like Graeme Le Saux get hounded for reading the Guardian? The questions just pile up and the answer is always the same. Because the English footballer is dumb. Effectively taken from school at a young age, he is afraid of what's outside his comfort zone where his job on the pitch is drilled into him until thought is no longer required. And he has every right to be afraid because once he's playing for a different team and the opposition mixes it up a bit, changes their formation, plays with intelligence to maximize their qualities and expose deficiencies in the opposition, England players are left flat footed, literally and metaphorically - witness Gerrards utter lack of awareness of the gap on the left midfield and Rooney continuing to play where he does at Man U. Mercy! Glen Hoddle alluded to it with his plea for 'flexibility'. Lineaker alluded to it with his reference to Gerrards lack of 'football nous'. Chris Waddle shouts it from the rooftops but there aint no debate because the football-media are (wait for it) ex-footballers or journos too damned scared to rock the boat through fear of losing their stipend. The English footballer is dumb. He is uneducated. He cannot therefore react dynamically to change. And it aint gonna change until society changes. I sound like a snob. So what. Have you ever wondered why the English Rugby team is good (the pundit and ex hooker fercrisskes Brian Moore is a qualified solicitor - how many....no don't bother), the English cricket team was until recently the best. They're thinking people. The English footballer is not and that Ladies and Gentlemen is why. Adrian O'Sullivan Having A Rio Carnival So the inevitable has finally happened. Rio is joining the triffic lads down at Loftus Road. According to the papers he has taken a pay cut to join us and is on about 1/3 of his previous salary....so about £65,000 a week. Im trying to stay positive, and say the only reason he will be more motivated than the overpaid tripe we bought last time (Bosingwa, im looking at you) is that 'Arry gave him in his chance therefore he wouldn't want to let him down. And then i realise we've given £65,000 a week to a 35 year old - our four centre backs are C.Hill, R Dunne, R Ferdinand, N Onuoha -and if you take Onuhoa out and put these three in a foot race, you'd have to clear your weekend diary to see the winner finish. But not to worry - he's triffic. Smuggler McSmugglerson Worried About Inflated Fees I'm sure you will have seen a lot of this in the comments section recently but I am finding it hard to get my head around some of the transfer fees being touted this summer. I'm a Manchester United season ticket holder and whilst I'm delighted that we are looking to rebuild (any also with Van Gaal's promise at the World Cup) I cannot but be a little worried. £34m for a left back with only two years Premier League experience and no CL football reeks of a huge risk, and whilst I believe Herrera is a good player is he worth one and a half Ruud Van Nistelrooys? I used to remember getting extremely excited when a player was costing more than £20m, but now it seems it has to be the norm for anyone half decent. I understand inflation and the fact that Chelski and the oil money next door have somewhat driven up the costs, but with FFP in place I am slightly bemused - is anyone else? Annoyingly, and I despise the man, the only player who seems to actually be worth the amounts being quoted in the press is that Uruguayan chap who tends to bite people. Jack, Battersea Three's A Crowd Following on from Hulmy's observation about Dani Alves sporting three different haircuts in three different games, I was wondering has any other team worn three different jerseys in three different group games before like Spain did in this World Cup? They wore all white against The Netherlands, all red against Chile and all black against Australia. Thoroughly interesting I'm sure you'll agree. Kieran Whooley (This esteemed MC is sad enough to point out that France in 1978 is your answer) Oh, You Guys Excellent Mediawatch today guys. Really, really good. Dominic Philpot	sports

Shotton is a product of Stoke's academy system and has played 70 first-team games for the Potters. The 25-year-old's versatility in that he can play in defence and midfield makes him an attractive proposition for his suitors as they look to bolster their squad options.	sports

I'd consider a straight swap, Messi for Suarez would be an acceptable gamble (and it would be a gamble - Messi's relatively poor form this season could be the beginnings of a decline) but I'd rather keep Suarez. Hopefully Suarez meant it when he said he doesn't want to leave and will come out and say it again after the World Cup. That was our favourite comment but there have been others - from those who refuse to believe that Suarez might want to leave Liverpool, just as they refused to believe that he might want to leave Liverpool last summer, refused to believe that he would use racist language and refused to believe that two biting incidents were anything other than coincidence. Now there's a third. As we are struggling to name more than a handful of footballers who have felt the need to sink their teeth into an opposition player once, surely even the Uruguayan's staunchest suppporters have to admit that three times offers pretty compelling evidence that they have been defending the indefensible. We have been told that he has redeemed himself this season by a) scoring a lot of goals and b) not biting or racially abusing anyone, prompting wonderful jokes about Adolf Hitler 'redeeming himself' with that 30-goal season for Sturm Graz. Like the audience who give the guests on Jeremy Kyle a round of applause for finding the strength to stop using the family allowance to buy crack, a lot of gullible people have been fooled - or have chosen to be fooled because, after all, he scores a lot of goals - by a total weapon briefly behaving like a decent human being. There is good news for those deluded Liverpool fans who would turn down Messi for the walking liability that is Suarez: He is now unlikely to join Real Madrid or Barcelona, two clubs who put far too much weight on commercial value to sign a footballer who would turn the stomach of many fans and sponsors. They baulked at signing him last summer after he grazed on Branislav Ivanovic and it's likely that they will baulk at signing him again after he repeated his trick on football's biggest stage. If Suarez had been keeping his nose (and teeth) clean for a year to re-build his reputation and earn himself a move, he has stumbled at the very last hurdle, just 12 or 13 minutes away from the end of his season as Uruguay faced World Cup exit. Such a low level of self-control is extraordinary. There will be those that ignore the video evidence and claim Suarez has been tried on reputation alone, there will those who claim that whatever he does in a Uruguayan shirt is irrelevant and there will be those who find somebody else to blame (the media again, perhaps?) for his indiscretions. But maybe there should also be those who admit that Liverpool only own one of the top five footballers in the world because he is so very, very flawed. Sarah Winterburn	sports

Failure By Fine Margins Teaches Nothing.... | F365 Says	Some will demand inquests but is there anything fundamentally wrong with England or are they just a half-decent side who came up narrowly short?

Last Updated: 24/06/14 at 23:35 Post Comment Latest Articles Surely there comes a point when even his greatest Liverpool-supporting defenders put their hands up and admit he's a tool.

It's difficult to vilify a man that did what we would do, says Philip Cornwall... If somebody had said two weeks ago that England would end the their Group D campaign having had the most shots (38), allowed the opposition the fewest attempts (25), dribbled past twice as many opposition players (41) as their rivals and had a pass completion rate of 85%, our only question would have been whether that was enough for first place or we would have to settle for a runners-up spot. England have, quite bizarrely, recorded the statistics of a team who have started this World Cup with the form of potential semi-finalists, rather than a team who have ended their sorry sojourn with just one point. Which shows you that a) statistics can sometimes be incredibly misleading and b) England really have failed by fine margins. England are not Spain, the world and European champions who saw their creaking system and players torn apart by Holland and then Chile; they are not Portugal, who have once again been exposed as a one-man band without a tune; they have simply been narrowly beaten twice by teams of very similar strength and then drawn a dead rubber 0-0 after fielding a much-changed side. It's the kind of 'not quite' run that even the greatest teams and the greatest managers will 'suffer' at least once a season. But this is international football and there is no looming run of games where the 'not quite' can quickly become the 'just about'. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with this English team in their tactics, their attitude, their desire; they simply lack a little bit of quality and, in this tournament, a little bit of luck. The difference between England finishing top or bottom of that group were a scuffed shot here, a poor refereeing decision there, a failure to track here, a header an inch too high there. I am no more depressed about this England side on the evening of June 24 as I was on the morning of June 14. It still has the same strengths (attacking players who can run at the opposition, the promise of youth, hard-working wide players) and weaknesses (an average defence, a lack of holding midfielders, no truly world-class player to make the difference in close encounters). It is a side good enough to beat most but rarely good enough to beat the best. It's incredibly lazy to talk about a lack of passion, it's incredibly crass to cite war metaphors, it's incredibly short-sighted to blame the manager, it's incredibly forgetful to blame a foreign influx and it's incredibly boring for the rest of us when club loyalties take over and individual players are cited. The rather dull truth is that England came up narrowly short. Play those games again with the same players and the results may have been different enough to see England through as champions. Play them a third time and we may not score a goal or claim a single point. There are still a handful of reasons to be cheerful and many reasons to be cheerless about England's future - you'll read plenty about the latter in the coming weeks because of what happened in ten pretty unsurprising days in Brazil, but the former will be forgotten for the same reason.

Transfer news: Premier League and Championship clubs chasing Stoke's Ryan Shotton | Football365 | Premier League News	Sky Sports understands a number of Premier League and Championship clubs are tracking Stoke City's Ryan Shotton. Last Updated: 24/06/14 at 16:19 Post Comment Ryan Shotton: Attracting interest from several clubs Shotton spent the first half of last season on loan at Wigan and he did not feature for Stoke after returning to the Britannia Stadium in January. News of Shotton's possible availability this summer has alerted a number of Premier League and Championship clubs. Shotton is a product of Stoke's academy system and has played 70 first-team games for the Potters. The 25-year-old's versatility in that he can play in defence and midfield makes him an attractive proposition for his suitors as they look to bolster their squad options.	sports

Transfer news: Veteran defender Rio Ferdinand in talks over move to Queens Park Rangers | Football365 | Premier League News	Rio Ferdinand is in talks with newly-promoted Queens Park Rangers – but that no deal has been done yet. Last Updated: 24/06/14 at 14:26 Post Comment Rio Ferdinand: Sees himself as an active footballer Ferdinand is a free agent after being released by Manchester United at the end of last season after 12 years at Old Trafford. If Ferdinand chooses to move to Loftus Road it will be the second time he has worked under Harry Redknapp. Ferdinand's representative Jamie Moralee has confirmed to Sky Sports News that Ferdinand is in talks over a proposed move to Loftus Road but no deal has been done as yet. Redknapp was the manager who gave him his debut at West Ham in 1996, and Ferdinand was the world’s most expensive defender when he left to join Leeds United in an £18million deal in 2000. Ferdinand moved to Old Trafford on a five-year contract in another record deal in July 2002 and went on to win six Premier League titles and the 2008 Champions League during his time with United. He played 81 times for England between 1997 and 2011 and was a member of three World Cup squads. Speaking before he headed to Brazil, where he is working as a World Cup pundit, Ferdinand said: "I see myself as going to Rio very much as an active footballer with playing time ahead of me. "It is feasible that in the coming weeks, perhaps even while I'm in South America, I'll make a decision about the next stage in my career. "I have options on the table from several clubs in England and overseas for next season and I'm intending to play on if the right situation arises." Rio's brother Anton played for QPR for two seasons, leaving Loftus Road following their relegation to the Championship in 2013. 	sports

Transfer news: Newcastle defender Mathieu Debuchy admits to missing Champions League | Football365 | Premier League News	Mathieu Debuchy plans to address his Newcastle United future after the World Cup as he admits to missing UEFA Champions League football. Last Updated: 25/06/14 at 08:52 Post Comment Mathieu Debuchy: Has caught the eye at Newcastle The France international graced European football’s premier club competition during his days at Lille, having helped them to the Ligue 1 title in 2011. A move to England followed in January 2013, with Debuchy joining the growing ranks of French talent at St James’ Park. The 28-year-old has been a consistent performer for an inconsistent Newcastle side and is currently chasing down global glory with his countrymen in Brazil. Speculation is mounting that he could be on the move once his efforts in South America come to a close, with Paris Saint-Germain among those said to be keen, and Debuchy has hinted that he may be willing to consider a switch. He said in the Evening Chronicle: “Personally, it’s a great adventure. I have discovered English charm, which is very hard, Newcastle and their extraordinary fans. “It’s really incredible to play in that atmosphere. “Having said that, I miss European football and the Champions League in particular. “For the moment, I’m concentrating on the World Cup. We’ll see about the rest afterwards.” For now, Debuchy’s focus is locked on keeping himself ahead of Manchester City new boy Bacary Sagna in France coach Didier Deschamps’ plans. Ahead of a meeting with Ecuador on Wednesday, which has France looking to make it three wins from three in Group E, he added: “I want to play against Ecuador, but it could be a good chance to get others involved. It’s up to the coach to decide. “The guys that haven’t played so far want to play in this game, we’re all competitive. I don’t count myself as a starter in this side, I take it one match at a time. “It’s great to play in this French team, as we’ve taken a huge step forward. The thing I love is our attacking play, it’s great to be a part of it.”	sports

If Suarez had been keeping his nose (and teeth) clean for a year to re-build his reputation and earn himself a move, he has stumbled at the very last hurdle, just 12 or 13 minutes away from the end of his season as Uruguay faced World Cup exit. Such a low level of self-control is extraordinary. There will be those that ignore the video evidence and claim Suarez has been tried on reputation alone, there will those who claim that whatever he does in a Uruguayan shirt is irrelevant and there will be those who find somebody else to blame (the media again, perhaps?) for his indiscretions. But maybe there should also be those who admit that Liverpool only own one of the top five footballers in the world because he is so very, very flawed. Sarah Winterburn	sports

A number of players have been linked with moves out of the Britannia Stadium, including experienced striker Peter Crouch, and Coates admits players will leave as they look to maintain the size of the squad. "There is certainly no financial pressure to sell," Coates told the Stoke Sentinel. "It's a question of the numbers and the balance of the squad. "There comes a point when a squad can become difficult to manage because of the numbers, so size is very important. "But ultimately, of course, it is always down to the manager who comes and who goes."	sports

Midfielder Yaya and Liverpool defender Kolo Toure are currently in Brazil with the Ivory Coast squad at the World Cup. And Yaya Toure told France Football that City prevented him from leaving the title celebrations in Dubai. He said: "City did not want to give me a few days. I went to celebrate in the wake of the league title in Abu Dhabi, while my brother was dying in his bed. "In retrospect, I regret not having insisted. For not making them respect me. However, my employers knew that I was suffering for a few months seeing my brother's health decline." Toure also said of Ibrahim: "He was my confidant, my best friend too." City have declined to comment on Toure's remarks but it is understood they were not approached about the possibility of him returning to the UK. The club has granted compassionate leave in the past – former boss Roberto Mancini missed a game following the death of his father.	sports

Last Updated: 24/06/14 at 15:49 Post Comment Ander Herrera: On verge of move to Manchester United Sky sources understand United are prepared to match the £28million buyout clause in the midfielder’s contract. United are aiming to get the deal - which would see Herrera sign a four-year contract - done by the end of this month as the buyout clause raises to £32m after 1 July. Herrera was the lynchpin of Bilbao's midfield last season as they finished in an impressive fourth place in La Liga.  He scored five goals in the campaign, but despite being one of the most impressive performers in domestic football, he is yet to break in to the Spain team. David Moyes was reportedly targeting Herrera, 24, last summer, but failed to land the central midfielder. There were bizarre scenes in Spain when, on transfer deadline, three men claiming to be representing United tried to negotiate the deal at the Spanish Football Association headquarters. The negotiations broke down and it transpired that United knew nothing about the three men.  But Moyes' successor as Manchester United boss, Louis van Gaal, looks set to pull off the deal as he begins rebuilding the squad. Herrera was born in Bilbao but came through the ranks at Real Zaragoza before joining his hometown club in 2011 on a five-year contract. Sky Sports News reporter James Cooper said: "It is very, very close. It is a question of when, not if. It is more likely to be on Wednesday but Manchester United are very close to making their first signing of the summer and the first signing under Louis van Gaal. "But Manchester United are proving they can go and get a player. It's a question of 'if at first you don't succeed, try, try, try again. Last summer there were some farcical scenes. Manchester United didn't match the buy-out clause. We saw the three stooges arrive at the Spanish FA headquarters - and the whole thing tumbled from there. "United have their own lawyers on the case this time and they have met the buy-out clause. Now it's a medical and personal terms with the player, and the beginning of a new era at Manchester United.  "A £30m fee is a big fee perhaps for a player who is 24 years old but who has not played for the Spanish national team. He did play for the Olympic team in London in 2012. But Manchester United have started their transfer business - and there will be plenty more, I promise you that." Southampton and England left-back Luke Shaw could be the next target - United have reportedly upped their offer for him to around £34m. 	sports

Transfer news: Newcastle defender Mathieu Debuchy admits to missing Champions League | Football365 | Premier League News	Mathieu Debuchy plans to address his Newcastle United future after the World Cup as he admits to missing UEFA Champions League football. Last Updated: 25/06/14 at 08:52 Post Comment Mathieu Debuchy: Has caught the eye at Newcastle The France international graced European football’s premier club competition during his days at Lille, having helped them to the Ligue 1 title in 2011. A move to England followed in January 2013, with Debuchy joining the growing ranks of French talent at St James’ Park. The 28-year-old has been a consistent performer for an inconsistent Newcastle side and is currently chasing down global glory with his countrymen in Brazil. Speculation is mounting that he could be on the move once his efforts in South America come to a close, with Paris Saint-Germain among those said to be keen, and Debuchy has hinted that he may be willing to consider a switch. He said in the Evening Chronicle: “Personally, it’s a great adventure. I have discovered English charm, which is very hard, Newcastle and their extraordinary fans. “It’s really incredible to play in that atmosphere. “Having said that, I miss European football and the Champions League in particular. “For the moment, I’m concentrating on the World Cup. We’ll see about the rest afterwards.” For now, Debuchy’s focus is locked on keeping himself ahead of Manchester City new boy Bacary Sagna in France coach Didier Deschamps’ plans. Ahead of a meeting with Ecuador on Wednesday, which has France looking to make it three wins from three in Group E, he added: “I want to play against Ecuador, but it could be a good chance to get others involved. It’s up to the coach to decide. “The guys that haven’t played so far want to play in this game, we’re all competitive. I don’t count myself as a starter in this side, I take it one match at a time. “It’s great to play in this French team, as we’ve taken a huge step forward. The thing I love is our attacking play, it’s great to be a part of it.”	sports
Transfer news: Stoke chairman Peter Coates confirms players will leave | Football365 | Premier League News	Stoke City chairman Peter Coates has admitted there will be departures from the club before the end of the transfer window. Last Updated: 24/06/14 at 12:01 Post Comment Peter Coates: Admits players will leave Stoke this summer The Potters have been busy in the transfer market this summer bringing in four new signings to bolster Mark Hughes' squad. A number of players have been linked with moves out of the Britannia Stadium, including experienced striker Peter Crouch, and Coates admits players will leave as they look to maintain the size of the squad. "There is certainly no financial pressure to sell," Coates told the Stoke Sentinel. "It's a question of the numbers and the balance of the squad. "There comes a point when a squad can become difficult to manage because of the numbers, so size is very important. "But ultimately, of course, it is always down to the manager who comes and who goes."	sports
Transfer news: Diego Costa's transfer from Atletico Madrid to Chelsea not done yet | Football365 | Premier League News	Diego Costa’s move to Chelsea is not yet a done deal and Thibaut Courtois will not be returning to Atletico Madrid, according to the Spanish club’s president Enrique Cerezo. Last Updated: 24/06/14 at 11:45 Post Comment Diego Costa: Part of Spain's miserable defence of their World Cup crown Cerezo confirmed Chelsea have made contact but have not agreed to meet the buy-out clause for the Brazilian-born striker, who was part of a dismal World Cup showing from Spain. The forward has long been linked with a big-money move to join Jose Mourinho at Chelsea, but Cerezo maintains the deal is far from complete. "We don't know anything about Costa, all we know is that Chelsea have made contact but we haven't received any money or anything else yet," Cerezo said. "Until we receive the money from his buy-out clause, he remains an Atletico player." Costa, 26, spearheaded Atletico’s attack in a memorable season in which they won La Liga and reached the Champions League final under Argentine manager Diego Simeone. Atletico have a history of losing their marquee players with Fernando Torres, Sergio Aguero and Radamel Falcao all having left the club in recent years. The Atletico president admitted it is very difficult to say no when the biggest teams in Europe come calling. "We've always tried to convince our players to stay, but the difference between our finances and that of other clubs is very large," he said. Cerezo also confirmed Belgian goalkeeping star Courtois, who has been on loan to Atletico for the past three seasons, is set to return to Chelsea. "Chelsea can count on Courtois, because he is their player," he said. That will set up an enviable dilemma for Mourinho as he will have to choose between Courtois and long-time first-choice goalkeeper Peter Cech. In addition to the likely departures of Costa and Courtois, Atletico have bid farewell to David Villa, who has signed for Melbourne City, and Tiago Mendes, who is out of contract. Brazilian defenders Filipe Luis and Joao Miranda have also been linked with moves away from the Vicente Calderon Stadium. Atletico have a ready-made replacement for Luis if he does depart after signing highly-rated left-back Guilherme Siqueira from Granada.   "That's the way football is," added Cerezo on the changes the La Liga champions will undergo this summer. "We will try and get new players to come in who can score more goals or save more goals than the ones that are leaving."	sports
Transfer news: Norwich City boss Neil Adams remains realistic over potential losses | Football365 | Premier League News	Neil Adams has warned Norwich City must be prepared to replace any players who may leave in the final week of the close season.

However, Adams remains a realist and understands that situation could drastically change before the window closes. This summer’s FIFA World Cup in Brazil has provided a distraction from the usual hive of transfer activity, and Adams admits he would delighted to keep his full squad intact. “If players leave, we’ve got to be ready to fill their positions,” Adams told the Norwich Evening News. “I don’t want players leaving, but of course I’m realistic to accept that might be the case. “I spoke to all the players at the end of last season - obviously not as full-time manager then, just to see whether they wanted to leave or be part of getting us back. “And virtually to a man, they were committed and there was a hunger there. Players who wanted to go and put it right.” Canaries playmaker Robert Snodgrass would be a significant loss and speculation surrounding the Scotland international’s future heightened on Monday with Sky Sources reporting Europa League-bound Hull City and fellow Premier League clubs QPR, Sunderland and West Brom have registered interest.	sports
Transfer news: Belgium striker Divock Origi admits Premier League football is his dream | Football365 | Premier League News	Belgium goal-hero Divock Origi admits that playing in the Premier League is his dream after enjoying a breakthrough at the World Cup. Last Updated: 24/06/14 at 14:16 Post Comment Divock Origi: Reported to be attracting interest after an impressive World Cup The 19-year-old, who currently plays in France with Lille, has impressed during his two substitute appearances in Brazil and he stepped off the bench to net a late winner as Belgium beat Russia 1-0 to secure their place in the last 16. Tottenham have reportedly been keeping tabs on the striker, while Arsenal and Liverpool are among the host of other European clubs to have been linked with a move for him. Origi says that he is only concerned about the World Cup at this moment in time, but acknowledges that playing in the top flight of English football is something that has appealed to him for some time. "As a little boy I always dreamed of playing in the Premier League but I'm still young and now I'm in an important tournament so I'm try to focus on the team," he said. "Then my entourage will see with Lille what I'll do." Origi featured 30 times in Ligue 1 last season, scoring six goals in the process as Lille secured an impressive third-placed finish.	sports

Di Maria, who has been linked with Manchester United and Manchester City, insists he is focusing on his country’s attempts to win their third world title but admits he does not know whether he will be at the Bernabeu next season. Di Maria said: "I've asked my agent not to tell me anything about the talks he's having. "I don't know what's going to happen with my career. I don't want to know anything about my future right now. "I'm focusing on my national team and not on what's going on elsewhere,” he added. "My team-mates and I don't read or listen to all the things being said in the media. "We're just thinking about ourselves and the unity of the group." Argentina struggled to a win over their Iranian counterparts, who seemed content to play a defensive game, and Di Maria has reacted angrily to suggestions that his side played below-par on Saturday. He told reporters: "I don't know why you keep saying we weren't playing well. When a team has 11 players in penalty area it's impossible to get in there."	sports

"If the amount of money that the newspaper mentions is true and we receive an offer like that, then River could sit down and start negotiations as it would be close to the amount the club expects for transferring Balanta. "If the money that is being mentioned in the English media is that, then we will have to listen to them when we receive an official offer. "Of course we would want to sell our players to the team that gets closest to our value." Balanta is currently with the Colombia squad at the World Cup finals.	sports

"This club has fantastic supporters and their backing has been phenomenal. Hopefully we can give them something to cheer about after what has been a very difficult 12 months for everyone at the club.

A number of other clubs have also been connected to Balotelli, including Milan’s Serie A rivals Napoli, and Berlusconi has opened the door to a possible departure. "Balotelli is a great player and a real Italian talent, but nobody is irreplaceable. We’ll see what happens," said Berlusconi, who is the daughter of club president Silvio Berlusconi and also joint-CEO. Kaka's future at Milan is also in doubt after Major League Soccer side Orlando City revealed they were in talks over a deal to sign the Brazilian, and Berlusconi admits he too could leave. She said: "Kaka made history with Milan and I know he needs to make this important decision with absolute calm. If he stays then we’ll be happy, but we’ll have to take it into account if he does want to go." While the likes of Baloteli and Kaka could be on their way out of the San Siro during the transfer window, Milan are still keen to strengthen their squad. Highly-rated Hellas Verona forward Juan Manuel Iturbe is one player on their radar and Berlusconi hopes a deal can be agreed. "Adriano Galliani (chief executive) and my father are working on it. This is a very solid club, among the best in Europe in terms of income," she said at a press conference.	sports

"I’m in the game long enough to know that and I’m more than happy with Sunderland." Staying put O'Shea has played over 100 games in his three seasons with Sunderland and insists he is looking to continue turning out at the top level for a while longer. "I definitely want to play on beyond next season," he said. "I played around 50 games last season and I'm fit and well, and long may that continue. "I'm already looking forward to next season after what was a roller-coaster end to last year. "But as for my future, that will be down to Sunderland. "I've never forced the issue throughout my career and I’m not about to start now. "Look, it was great getting to the League Cup final and that was definitely an ambition when I joined Sunderland, to get to a Cup final and obviously to win one. "It would have been special had we held on that day but unfortunately that brilliant Yaya Toure goal put City back in it before Samir Nasri won it."	sports
Transfer news: French striker Bafetimbi Gomis flying to Swansea for talks | Football365 | Premier League News	Sky sources understand French striker Bafetimbi Gomis is flying to Swansea on Monday to hold talks over a potential move to the Liberty Stadium. Last Updated: 23/06/14 at 14:59 Post Comment Batefimbi Gomis: Set for Swansea talks The 28-year-old is expected to meet with Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins and the club’s manager Garry Monk to thrash out terms over a free transfer. Gomis is one of the most sought after free agents in Europe, following the expiry of his contract with Ligue 1 side Lyon. The France international scored 22 goals in 49 appearances in all competitions for Lyon last season and had been linked with a move to Premier League sides Newcastle, Sunderland and West Ham. Gomis is not part of Didier Deschamps’ France World Cup squad but has made 12 appearances for Les Bleus, scoring three times. Swansea are thought to have bid for Gomis last summer, before they signed Wilfried Bony. The move for Gomis will inevitably put a question mark over Bony’s future with the club. The 25-year-old’s agent recently said Bony will remain with Swansea unless the opportunity arises for him to move to a top six side in England, Germany, France or Spain. Bony became Swansea’s club-record signing when he made a £13million move from Vitesse Arnhem and is currently on international duty at the World Cup with Ivory Coast. Swansea also have Spanish forward Michu on their books, although the former Rayo Vallecano man has been linked with West Ham, Stoke and Napoli. Michu scored 22 goals in his first season with Swansea but only found the back of the net on six occasions last term.	sports

Jose Mourinho has already stated that Courtois was in his plans for next season and Wilmots has confirmed this, but also added to the intrigue surrounding current No.1 Petr Cech, suggesting he could be sold. The conversation between Houllier and Courtois was broadcast by RTBF, in which the Frenchman asked: "Does he [Courtois] go back to Chelsea?" "He goes back to Chelsea," Wilmots replied. "They will sell Cech, then?" enquired Houllier, "If possible, yes," said the Belgian coach. Courtois has already suggested he would be heading back to Chelsea, and if he does it remains to be seen how that will impact on Cech, who has played over 300 games for the west London giants after joining from Rennes in 2004.	sports

AIFF President Praful Patel said: “The AIFF is extremely pleased to be a part of the strategic partnership between the Premier League and the Indian Super League. “This is an outstanding opportunity for the Indian Super League to build from the very best in the business when it comes to running a highly successful league. "The Premier League is revered around the world, and by learning from the practitioners who have made it so successful, the Indian Super League will develop and grow in the right way, ensuring benefits not only for the league itself but also for the wider Indian football ecosystem in the longer term."

Last Updated: 24/06/14 at 10:13 Post Comment Alberto Moreno: Wanted by Liverpool Castro revealed earlier this month that Liverpool were leading the chase for the highly-rated 21-year-old, although no deal has yet been agreed. The Sevilla chief insists that he will not be selling Moreno for less than the value they have set on the player - and Moreno has a release clause of £24.5million. "It's true that there is interest from a number of clubs, above all Liverpool, in him, but we haven't had proper conversations about selling him," Castro told ABC. "We haven't reached an agreement, but talks haven't broken down. We'll wait and see what happens. "If Liverpool are interested in the player and pay the right amount, he will be sold. "Signing any player from this club has a price and we will decide that price. "If Alberto Moreno has to stay at the club he will stay but if a club pays the amount we think is big enough for him to leave, he will leave. But there is no pressure."	sports
I never dodged England duty, insists Scott Parker after Harry Redknapp claims | News	Scott Parker says he never wanted to sidestep England duty, following claims made by his former manager at Tottenham, Harry Redknapp. Last Updated: 25/06/14 at 07:35 Post Comment Scott Parker: England appearances the "pinnacle" of his career Redknapp claimed that "two or three" English players had asked him to withdraw them from international duty while he was in charge at White Hart Lane between 2008 and 2012. The now-QPR boss has refused to name names but Parker, who won 18 England caps between 2003 and 2012 and spent two years playing under Redknapp at Spurs - insisted that featuring for his country had been the "pinnacle" of his career. Asked if he had never not wanted to represent England, Parker told Sky Sports News: "No, never. "I probably speak for every boy and everyone out there: playing for your country, replicating the players in the World Cup is something you dream of. "I remember Italia '90, being 10 and playing outside in the garden, thinking I was Gazza (Paul Gascoigne) and my friends thinking the same. "I can only speak from a personal level - obviously you get some people in life who'll be different - but I think the majority of players who put on an England shirt are very proud. "I hear people say that other countries are more passionate and have more desire but whenever I've been involved in the England set-up, the players have been committed. "It's a boy's dream; I can't contemplate not wanting to play for England. It's something I will always remember, the pinnacle of my career."	sports

World Cup: Frank Lampard unsure over England future after Costa Rica draw | News	Frank Lampard remains unsure over his international future after England’s World Cup campaign limped to a conclusion with a 0-0 draw against Costa Rica. Last Updated: 24/06/14 at 20:39 Post Comment Frank Lampard: Veteran midfielder captained England in 0-0 draw with Costa Rica The veteran midfielder, who will end his long association with Chelsea this summer, captained the side but could not lead them to victory over Costa Rica, who progress to the last 16 as Group D winners with England at the bottom of the table. With Lampard now 36, it is likely to have been his final World Cup appearance, but he insists he is yet to decide when he will call time on his career with the Three Lions. When asked about his future, he told ITV: "I don't know. I really enjoyed being involved and I love playing for my country, that's obvious. I am 36 and still doing it. "I feel fresh. If I feel I can offer something I will do but at the moment it is too soon to say." Lampard agreed with Roy Hodgson’s post-match assessment that England had been the better side and could have won the game comfortably had they taken the opportunities they created, while also paying tribute to the support of the travelling fans. He added: "It was a difficult game to approach. "I think we did everything we could do. We showed a bit of character, we prepared right for the last two days. Everyone knows how tough it's been. "It wasn't vintage but we had enough chances to win the game. I think we played some good stuff, bright stuff at times, and created enough chances to win. “We’re England, we expect more, they expect more and we didn’t deliver. England fans have been an absolute credit, it’s a shame we couldn’t do enough to take them through and give them a longer trip.”	sports
Barcelona and Real Madrid attract backing to sign Luis Suarez amid renewed press reports | Football365 | Premier League News	Sky Bet have slashed the odds on Luis Suarez leaving Liverpool this summer with Barcelona and Real Madrid both backed to secure his services. Last Updated: 23/06/14 at 15:08 Post Comment Luis Suarez: Linked with Barcelona and Real Madrid yet again Press reports surrounding a release clause in the Uruguay star's contract seem to have sparked the surge in interest, with suggestions that the Spanish giants are ready to engage in a battle for his signature. On the back of a phenomenal campaign for the Reds, in which he netted 31 times to put them on the brink of winning the Premier League, Suarez sent England crashing out of the World Cup with a brace on Thursday night. The 27-year-old recently moved to allay fears of his departure, telling Uruguayan TV channel Canal 10: "Don't worry, nothing is going to happen to me. I'm very happy here and my family is happy here." He also signed a new long-term contract in December but that has done little to prevent renewed speculation on a move to Spain this summer. Sky Bet's Head of Football Trading Paul Wiggins said: "We've seen a sudden surge in bets on Suarez's next club, with Barcelona in particular attracting backing. "While we're assuming these bets are a result of the media speculation as opposed to any inside knowledge, the volume of interest has forced us to cut his price on leaving from 2/1 to 5/6, with both Barcelona and Real Madrid 9/4 to get a deal done."

Premier League: Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud wants to improve scoring record | Football365 | Premier League News	Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud is determined to improve his scoring record and revealed manager Arsene Wenger is offering him plenty of guidance. Last Updated: 23/06/14 at 10:47 Post Comment Olivier Giroud: Looking to improve his scoring record at Arsenal The Gunners striker is currently helping France’s World Cup bid in Brazil and claimed an historic goal for his country during Friday’s 5-2 triumph over Switzerland. After being used as a second-half substitute in a 3-0 win over Honduras, Giroud was brought into the starting line-up and got Les Bleus off to a flying start with a 17th-minute header which took France to 100 World Cup goals. On the domestic front, Giroud netted 16 goals and chalked up eight assists as Arsenal finished fourth in the Premier League but the 27-year-old is well aware of the need for a better return. “I feel I can go on improving,” he told L’Equipe. “I can improve some parts of my game and have better statistics. “For a forward, statistics are important, especially when you negotiate a contract. In the Champions League, it was more difficult. But you also need titles and key performances. “I am working hard in front of goal post to try to sort out some details. I think about missed opportunities, notably against Chelsea.” Former Montpellier forward Giroud, who made the switch to Emirates Stadium in 2012, is keen to review his performances and admits Arsenal boss Wenger is looking for him to develop into a more intelligent player. “I have to be more decisive in the box, but also in my way to keep the ball and defend,” he added. “You have to be demanding, trying to find peace in front of goal. “At least once a week I try to work in front of goal. I have been doing it systematically since I have been at Arsenal. I need it. “Arsene Wenger often gives me corrections after matches. We are talking about opportunities. “To him, I am not crafty enough. Once he told me I am too frank in my runs, too predictable. I have to be more confusing.”	sports

World Cup: England campaign ends with 0-0 draw against Group D winners Costa Rica | Football365 | Football Match Reports	Daniel Sturridge: Challenged by Oscar Duarte Roy Hodgson made nine changes to his starting line-up from the defeat against Uruguay, with the new-look side showing promise but suffering from many of the same failings which proved so costly in the 2-1 defeats by Italy and Uruguay. Daniel Sturridge, who had a strong first-half appeal for a penalty waved away, missed an excellent second-half chance to break the deadlock and there were several other promising opportunities which England could not take advantage of, while the defence looked occasionally shaky, with Chris Smalling particularly nervous. Ben Foster did well as Joe Hart’s replacement, tipping one first-half free-kick from Celso Borges onto the top of the crossbar, but he was less employed than opposite number Keylor Navas in Belo Horizonte, the scene of England’s infamous 1950 defeat to the USA. England's fans started off by cheering their team loudly, and the likes of Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana and the impressive Jack Wilshere responded with good performances. But by the end there was a flat feeling among the few thousand who had come to Estadio Mineirao and England head home having amassed just one point from their three matches - their worst points total in World Cup history. For the first minute and a half, Costa Rica's noisy fans shouted "Ole" as England chased shadows in the lunchtime heat. Within four minutes England were nearly behind. Randall Brenes found Joel Campbell on the edge of the box and his deflected looped up off Gary Cahill past Foster's goal. A few groans were heard as Smalling sliced a simple pass out of play. Cahill needlessly punted the ball out moments later. Finally, England came into the game courtesy of Wilshere, who beat two players and found Sturridge, but he dragged his shot just wide. Shaw, the youngest England player to start a World Cup game since Michael Owen, showed no sign of nerves going forward, but he gave away a free-kick in a dangerous position. Borges stepped up and bent a dipping shot over the wall and onto the bar via the fingertips of the athletic Foster. The only other point of note in the dull first period came just before the half hour when a Ross Barkley touched James Milner's cross into the path of Sturridge. The Liverpool striker shaped to shoot, but Duarte brought him down with an out-stretched leg. Referee Djamel Haimoudi waved play on, much to Sturridge's dismay. Fortune favoured England in a move straight after the break. Shaw's shot looped straight into the path of Sturridge in the box, but the striker mis-controlled, allowing Costa Rica goalkeeper Navas to smother the ball. Giancarlo Gonzalez dumped Barkley on the turf with a wrestling move, but Frank Lampard, appearing possibly for the last time in an England shirt, wasted the free-kick, driving straight into the wall. Phil Jones, a few minutes after failing to control a simple pass, then gave possession away inside his own half, but luckily for England Christian Bolanos shot straight at Foster. Wishere played a lovely one-two with Sturridge to set the striker free inside the box, but he curled an inch wide. Hodgson tried to inject some life into his team by introducing Raheem Sterling. The England support then demanded Wayne Rooney enter the pitch. Instead they got Steven Gerrard, who was cheered by the fans, who suspected this might be the captain's final England appearance. Rooney finally came on with 15 minutes left. The Manchester United striker attempted an audacious chip over Navas within minutes of his introduction. He also came within inches of turning home Lampard's cross in the dying minutes. England kept on trying, but they could not beat Costa Rica - a team ranked below Scotland by FIFA.	sports

Not Too Late For Rodwell To Lead England | Football365 | Opinion | Mailbox	Latest Articles An interesting Mailbox with thoughts on player intelligence, Rio Ferdinand's last hurrah with 'Arry, inflated transfer fees and wanting England to lose against Costa Rica... It does seem a tad ridiculous. But it will allow Liverpool to build half a team. We have lots of mails on England really not being bad, Henderson for captain and more... If you have anything to say on any subject, mail us at theeditor@football365.com Get Jack Back It has been often said during this tournament that England have lacked a truly defensive midfielder/screening midfielder/ whatever the current preferred term might be. The tragedy is that back in 2011, England had exactly what we needed - a young, tenacious, exciting, strong, physical, defensively capable midfielder, who was also able to break forward and find a through ball when necessary. Unfortunately (for him and for England), rather than make his name in his preferred position at the club where he grew into his trade, he moved to a bigger club (for admittedly understandable reasons, both financial and professional). I am of course talking about Jack Rodwell moving from Everton to Man City. We'll never know whether Rodwell would have become the player he was tipped to become had he got regular match time for the last 3 seasons - but what we do know is that other players who became "lost" in a large squad at a big club, have gone on to revive their careers when given a more prominent role (for example, Daniel Sturridge). I guess this leads me to two conclusions - firstly, for England to have the best chance in 2016, we need players like Shaw, Lallana, Barkley, Wilshere, Stones and even Jones and Smalling (heaven help us all) to play regularly in their best positions. Jones and Smalling in particular are excellent examples of players touted for a bright future at Blackburn and Fulham, hoovered up by a bigger club, then marginalised and held out of their best positions (by Vidic and Ferdinand, admittedly). This has clearly led to a regression in their performances that cannot simply be explained away by the argument of "the larger the club, the more focus on the player". This leads me to my second conclusion, that all hope is not lost for such players if they are given the chance to play regularly. If Rodwell does (as expected) leave Citeh on loan (or permanently) during this summer, there is still the opportunity for him to become the player that we all hoped he could be three seasons ago. Rodwell is still only 23 - coincidentally, the same age as Sturridge when he signed for Liverpool - and has plenty of time to mature into the combative midfielder (and captain?) that England will sorely need in 2016. Equally, the departure of Vidic and Ferdinand may give Jones and Smalling the opportunity to grow into the central defensive partnership that United (and England) are crying out for (unless Van Gaal buys Ron Vlaar.) Perhaps it's the fact that I support a "small" club, but I sincerely hope that if England's current crop of promising youngsters that are linked with a high profile transfer do make the jump to United (Shaw) / Liverpool (Barkley, Lallana) / Chelsea (Stones), that they are given the competitive game time to continue their development - not just for their own benefit, but for that of the national side as well. Terry Hall, Switzerland England Would Be Special Why can't the FA just give Jose Mourinho a shed load of cash, and promise him a knighthood when he wins us the World Cup. Hodgson might be a lovely chap and have all the best intentions, but his football teams have never won anything. All the youth development in the world doesn't make a difference when the manager has no tactical awareness. England look completely devoid of ideas when playing and seem to have had little coaching in how to attack in the final third. To compound it, England set up to allow the opposition to settle into position before every attack commences. It made me sick recently when I read we nearly got Jose for England manager and we ended up with Capello. Imagine England at this tournament with Jose leading it - England certainly wouldn't be out yet. Everybody hates Jose, apart from Chelsea fans I imagine. If he was managing England and getting us to the World Cup final he would be a national hero. Jim (for the record, not a Chelsea fan), Canterbury Shape Of Things To Come This might have already been said - if not, it should have - but England are not going to get any better in the next two years unless things change. We're out of another competition and it's the same old story. In two years time, the situation will be exactly the same; we'll qualify relatively easily (one or two dodgy away matches aside) and go into the Euros in decent form. Some of our players will have had good domestic seasons and there will be a quiet optimism that we can perform well. Sound familiar? That's pretty much the story for almost every tournament since Euro 96. We always kid ourselves into believing that we're on the cusp of another "golden generation", as if to say: "Don't worry about this tournament lads, it's the next one that counts. You'll be better for this experience." But we won't, at least not until things change. We need to stop relying on the supposed quality of our players and start putting more emphasis on effective tactics and systems. Look at the Dutch team; how many of those players would you say are superstars? Robben and van Persie are really the only ones that fit the bill. Of the rest, you've got Leroy Fer (relegated last season), Krul, De Guzman, Vorm and Vlaar (finished 10th, 12th & 15th with Newcastle, Swansea & Villa respectively). Plus four from Feyenoord, who got knocked out in the playoffs of the Europa League. Yet see how well they play. They have got their game plan spot on - even without van Persie in the line-up they weren't affected; if anything they defended better. The same goes for teams like Chile, USA, Mexico, Ghana, Costa Rica, Columbia etc. (success being relative, of course). It doesn't matter how good we think Luke Shaw, Raheem Sterling, Phil Jones, Ross Barkley et al are going to be; if we don't get the system right, it's moot. You can have the best players in world football in your team but if you don't use them in the right way you're still going to struggle. Case in point, Portugal; they have the Ballon D'Or winner in their team, and they've only got one point, having scored just twice. It's time to start actually planning how to deal with the opposition - learning to exploit their weaknesses and defend against their strengths. Enough of just chucking whichever flavours of the week aren't injured into some random formation and hoping for the best. If it means dropping players like Rooney or Gerrard, or bringing in players from less "fashionable" teams then so be it. I'm not saying we have no chance in the Euros but unless lessons are learned from both other countries, and from this tournament in general, then it's all just a little bit of history repeating. Ted, Manchester Foster And Bentley Deserve Credit Usually I'm with Nick Miller when he writes columns but on this occasion I think he is so desperate to play devil's advocate to the accepted norm that he has confused his own argument. I agree that if a player doesn't feel pride in representing his country then he shouldn't force/fake it but equally he should make it clear that he does not want to be considered for selection rather than taking up a position that a player who wants to play could take. I have much more respect for a Ben Foster, even as with many fans I'll never understand why you wouldn't want to play, being honest about it and requesting he isn't selected than a player who accepts the call-up then doesn't bother or pulls out at every available opportunity. The Foster issue is also hugely different to David Bentley's situation. While few football fans could understand why a footballer would ever give up that life/career to many it is probably just a job that pays the bills and many of us hate our jobs, perhaps do a half-arsed job but go into work every day and pick up the pay cheque regardless. So I don't blame Bentley for that even if it would piss me off to see him continue to pick up a wage at my club and provide nothing in return. If he chooses not to even do that then he deserves some credit. To confuse either of these issues with Capello missing his son's wedding or a player wanting to miss an international because his partner is expecting is nonsense and Redknapp knew this when he stuck his oar in and Nick should see this as well and call it for the petty, pathetic score settling that it is. He wasn't appealing for paternity leave for footballers, he was kicking Hodgson and the FA when they were down. These are legitimate reasons for missing a game/work and should be treated as such so if any attitude needs to change it is for these reasons not dead grannies or fake injuries or lack of pride. Also what is with this 'Suarez has had one good season' nonsense that seems to be sneaking into the mailbox as if it is fact? The guy scored 23 goals two years ago to go with his 31 this year despite missing 10 games, that's 54 goals in 66 games. He has a one in two record at international level and was top scorer in the qualifying campaign having been named player of the tournament at the last Copa America and having an excellent 2010 World Cup. All that without including his phenomenal record at Ajax (as we all know goals in countries other than Spain, Germany, Italy, France and especially England do not count). The guy has been superb for at least the past four years and has been getting better and better year on year and the figures being rumoured are therefore absolutely fair. Regards, Lindsay, Melbourne. Neymar: He's Quite Good How good was Neymar last night?! Yes he scored two good goals, but the most impressive things I saw from him were: - Tireless running to chase down loose balls and pressurise defenders. He is clearly not a lazy flair player. - Tricks and flicks being attempted. Some came off - there was a brilliant little flick off the outside of his right foot as he pirouetted to the left at the end of the first half which almost set up an awesome goal. But it's the fact that he kept trying them that made me most impressed; no England players would have attempted a rainbow kick from just outside the box. - No f***ying about! He got a bit of a kicking, but was generally straight back up again. Didn't go to ground as easily as most players have been doing at this WC. I know it was 'only' Cameroon, but I thought he was ace. Ian (Aberdeen kick off their Europa League season next week, jeez!) Towns, MUFC Slow And Steady Wins The Race In response to Andy, London, who wrote in to highlight how the World Cup is usually won by a slow starter - I couldn't agree more. I have been evangelising this truth for the past weeks to a somewhat uninterested & stubborn audience. Most of my mates watched the first round of games and immediately concluded that the semi-finalists would be Holland, Brazil, Germany, Argentina. I too wondered if they have never watched a World Cup before. It's a hard concept to explain but it just almost always turns out that way. The thing with a tournament like the World Cup is that, firstly, it is just that - a tournament, and not a league. Five goals in your first game doesn't give you any advantage over a team that draws their first two games and scraps through by an own-goal in the third group game. Also, it is very difficult to keep up the type of pace Holland (for example) started with for seven games - heck its hard in any part of the world to go seven games unbeaten. You can lose one game in the first three and still survive, but losing one game in the last four is the end of the road. Hence, a team can't afford to have a bad game in the second two weeks, but can afford to have a bad game in the first two weeks, learn your mistakes and power on from there. Your opposition gets tougher as the tournament progresses too and someone will have studied your technique by the time you get to the QF/SF stage. The chances of injuries and suspensions increase and the loss of a key defender to suspension/injury just means one mistake from a newcomer playing their first game of the tournament means the end of a World Cup for you. There is no goal difference factor later. There are just so many variables involved - nine points from the first three games means very little. That said, it's been a belter of a World Cup.

James, Ireland Not Wanting England To Win Without wanting to be accused of treason and marched to the front door of a grieving family by Ian Wright, I think a convincing victory for England today could be the worst thing that could happen, and that's not just for the headline 'Costa Eureka!' that will adorn the papers tomorrow. Of course, it makes sense to always have half an eye on the next major tournament, and the expansion to 24 teams in the European Championships means that England should really never fail to qualify for it ever again, but much like any game of football, you should be picking your best players to get the job done. Tonight is a meaningless game for England and I can understand the experimentation, but should they win 3-0, that does not mean this is England's best team. The cry for this massively inexperienced team to carry on into the qualifiers for Euro 2016 will be deafening and I only hope Roy Hodgson has the sense about him to realise that actually, the team he picked for the first two games is, more or less, his best team, even if it wasn't utilised in the best manner. There are question marks of course, and as with any tournament, you would expect a couple of players to be phased out. Wholesale change though is not needed. Wholesale change has already happened in many respects when you look at this squad compared to that of even two years ago. Half the squad has changed already - that's major surgery! Many people seem to be pinning their hopes on the likes of Luke Shaw, who is a very good player but is still very young, and John Stones, who has a handful of impressive games for Everton under his belt. These guys may turn out to be wonderful players, but if they don't break into the England team until they're 22/23, that isn't the end of the world. Seriously, when will we learn? Leighton Baines, despite being 29, is still a relative newcomer to the international scene and deserves a chance to bed in. The same is true of the likes of Lallana, Henderson, Wilshere and even Jagielka and Cahill. Because of the longevity of the previous generation, we have a raft of players in their mid to late twenties with very little international experience. Any good team has the right mix of youth and experience. To throw the likes of Gerrard, Rooney (and dare I say it, Ashley Cole) on the scrap heap too early would be cutting off our nose to spite our face. Italy with Pirlo and Mexico with Marquez have both put extra players in certain areas on their team to allow their older players to continue to flourish, which is something Hodgson has neglected to do. Isn't something along those lines worthy of experimentation as much as filling the team full of kids who have thus far shown no signs of surpassing the people they are being lined up to replace? I think, as a nation, we are sorely mistaken if we think we have players of the quality of Gerrard, Lampard and Rooney coming through our ranks. If it forces us to focus on the collective rather than the individual then it's for the better, but forgive me if I remain sceptical on that one. Andy, London England had The Group Of Death Ever since the WC draw, Group G with Germany/Portugal/USA/Ghana has been dubbed the "group of death". At the time, I couldn't argue. As of December 6, 2013, Ze Germans were ranked 2nd, Portugal 5th, USA 14th and Ghana 24th. 45 total? That's ridiculous! Come the start of the World Cup, however, Despite Germany still being 2nd, Portugal up to 4th and USA up to 13th, Ghana had dropped to 37th. That's a combined total of 56. Uruguay at 7th, Italy at 9th, England at 10th and Costa Rica at 28th gives us a total of 54, the lowest combined ranking of any group. We were 6/7/13/31 for 57 at the time of the draw. I still hold onto some hope that we can beat Costa Rica today and save some face after playing the REAL Group of Death at this year's WC. Dickon, Sandford Send Them All To School With a country of 60 million people, amongst the highest paid players in the world, a smorgasbord of talent, why do we always fail dismally at international competition. To answer this, you must find the unique characteristic of the English footballer. And this is found at the heart, no the arse of this septic isle. The chav. The ignoramus who lionized Jade Goody (God rest her soul), the country that invented binge drinking, the nation with the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in Europe, the 'fan' who whilst not inventing football hooliganism, gave it that English touch; the English footballer is royalty amongst them all. This squad is dumb and getting dumber. Ask yourself how many players speak a foreign language ('Professor' Lampard's latin doesn't count). Most squads are bi-lingual and more. Why has no player in the Premiership come out as Gay, why do none of the squad play abroad? Why does an intelligent guy like Graeme Le Saux get hounded for reading the Guardian? The questions just pile up and the answer is always the same. Because the English footballer is dumb. Effectively taken from school at a young age, he is afraid of what's outside his comfort zone where his job on the pitch is drilled into him until thought is no longer required. And he has every right to be afraid because once he's playing for a different team and the opposition mixes it up a bit, changes their formation, plays with intelligence to maximize their qualities and expose deficiencies in the opposition, England players are left flat footed, literally and metaphorically - witness Gerrards utter lack of awareness of the gap on the left midfield and Rooney continuing to play where he does at Man U. Mercy! Glen Hoddle alluded to it with his plea for 'flexibility'. Lineaker alluded to it with his reference to Gerrards lack of 'football nous'.

Have you ever wondered why the English Rugby team is good (the pundit and ex hooker fercrisskes Brian Moore is a qualified solicitor - how many....no don't bother), the English cricket team was until recently the best.

Rio is joining the triffic lads down at Loftus Road. According to the papers he has taken a pay cut to join us and is on about 1/3 of his previous salary....so about £65,000 a week. Im trying to stay positive, and say the only reason he will be more motivated than the overpaid tripe we bought last time (Bosingwa, im looking at you) is that 'Arry gave him in his chance therefore he wouldn't want to let him down. And then i realise we've given £65,000 a week to a 35 year old - our four centre backs are C.Hill, R Dunne, R Ferdinand, N Onuoha -and if you take Onuhoa out and put these three in a foot race, you'd have to clear your weekend diary to see the winner finish. But not to worry - he's triffic. Smuggler McSmugglerson Worried About Inflated Fees I'm sure you will have seen a lot of this in the comments section recently but I am finding it hard to get my head around some of the transfer fees being touted this summer. I'm a Manchester United season ticket holder and whilst I'm delighted that we are looking to rebuild (any also with Van Gaal's promise at the World Cup) I cannot but be a little worried. £34m for a left back with only two years Premier League experience and no CL football reeks of a huge risk, and whilst I believe Herrera is a good player is he worth one and a half Ruud Van Nistelrooys? I used to remember getting extremely excited when a player was costing more than £20m, but now it seems it has to be the norm for anyone half decent. I understand inflation and the fact that Chelski and the oil money next door have somewhat driven up the costs, but with FFP in place I am slightly bemused - is anyone else?

Giving Rio £65,000 A Week. What Could Go Wrong? | Football365 | Opinion | Mailbox	Latest Articles Jack Rodwell can become the player England crave, according to one mailboxer. Others are enjoying Neymar and longing for Jose Mourinho as England boss... It does seem a tad ridiculous. But it will allow Liverpool to build half a team. We have lots of mails on England really not being bad, Henderson for captain and more... If you have anything to say on any subject, mail us at theeditor@football365.com We Got a Few Of These Terry Hall, Switzerland. Jack Rodwell England Captain in 2016? Are you on drugs? James, Ireland Not Wanting England To Win Without wanting to be accused of treason and marched to the front door of a grieving family by Ian Wright, I think a convincing victory for England today could be the worst thing that could happen, and that's not just for the headline 'Costa Eureka!' that will adorn the papers tomorrow. Of course, it makes sense to always have half an eye on the next major tournament, and the expansion to 24 teams in the European Championships means that England should really never fail to qualify for it ever again, but much like any game of football, you should be picking your best players to get the job done. Tonight is a meaningless game for England and I can understand the experimentation, but should they win 3-0, that does not mean this is England's best team. The cry for this massively inexperienced team to carry on into the qualifiers for Euro 2016 will be deafening and I only hope Roy Hodgson has the sense about him to realise that actually, the team he picked for the first two games is, more or less, his best team, even if it wasn't utilised in the best manner. There are question marks of course, and as with any tournament, you would expect a couple of players to be phased out. Wholesale change though is not needed. Wholesale change has already happened in many respects when you look at this squad compared to that of even two years ago. Half the squad has changed already - that's major surgery! Many people seem to be pinning their hopes on the likes of Luke Shaw, who is a very good player but is still very young, and John Stones, who has a handful of impressive games for Everton under his belt.

Not Too Late For Rodwell To Lead England | Football365 | Opinion | Mailbox	Latest Articles An interesting Mailbox with thoughts on player intelligence, Rio Ferdinand's last hurrah with 'Arry, inflated transfer fees and wanting England to lose against Costa Rica... It does seem a tad ridiculous. But it will allow Liverpool to build half a team. We have lots of mails on England really not being bad, Henderson for captain and more... If you have anything to say on any subject, mail us at theeditor@football365.com Get Jack Back It has been often said during this tournament that England have lacked a truly defensive midfielder/screening midfielder/ whatever the current preferred term might be. The tragedy is that back in 2011, England had exactly what we needed - a young, tenacious, exciting, strong, physical, defensively capable midfielder, who was also able to break forward and find a through ball when necessary. Unfortunately (for him and for England), rather than make his name in his preferred position at the club where he grew into his trade, he moved to a bigger club (for admittedly understandable reasons, both financial and professional). I am of course talking about Jack Rodwell moving from Everton to Man City. We'll never know whether Rodwell would have become the player he was tipped to become had he got regular match time for the last 3 seasons - but what we do know is that other players who became "lost" in a large squad at a big club, have gone on to revive their careers when given a more prominent role (for example, Daniel Sturridge). I guess this leads me to two conclusions - firstly, for England to have the best chance in 2016, we need players like Shaw, Lallana, Barkley, Wilshere, Stones and even Jones and Smalling (heaven help us all) to play regularly in their best positions. Jones and Smalling in particular are excellent examples of players touted for a bright future at Blackburn and Fulham, hoovered up by a bigger club, then marginalised and held out of their best positions (by Vidic and Ferdinand, admittedly). This has clearly led to a regression in their performances that cannot simply be explained away by the argument of "the larger the club, the more focus on the player". This leads me to my second conclusion, that all hope is not lost for such players if they are given the chance to play regularly. If Rodwell does (as expected) leave Citeh on loan (or permanently) during this summer, there is still the opportunity for him to become the player that we all hoped he could be three seasons ago. Rodwell is still only 23 - coincidentally, the same age as Sturridge when he signed for Liverpool - and has plenty of time to mature into the combative midfielder (and captain?) that England will sorely need in 2016. Equally, the departure of Vidic and Ferdinand may give Jones and Smalling the opportunity to grow into the central defensive partnership that United (and England) are crying out for (unless Van Gaal buys Ron Vlaar.) Perhaps it's the fact that I support a "small" club, but I sincerely hope that if England's current crop of promising youngsters that are linked with a high profile transfer do make the jump to United (Shaw) / Liverpool (Barkley, Lallana) / Chelsea (Stones), that they are given the competitive game time to continue their development - not just for their own benefit, but for that of the national side as well. Terry Hall, Switzerland England Would Be Special Why can't the FA just give Jose Mourinho a shed load of cash, and promise him a knighthood when he wins us the World Cup. Hodgson might be a lovely chap and have all the best intentions, but his football teams have never won anything. All the youth development in the world doesn't make a difference when the manager has no tactical awareness. England look completely devoid of ideas when playing and seem to have had little coaching in how to attack in the final third. To compound it, England set up to allow the opposition to settle into position before every attack commences. It made me sick recently when I read we nearly got Jose for England manager and we ended up with Capello. Imagine England at this tournament with Jose leading it - England certainly wouldn't be out yet. Everybody hates Jose, apart from Chelsea fans I imagine. If he was managing England and getting us to the World Cup final he would be a national hero. Jim (for the record, not a Chelsea fan), Canterbury Shape Of Things To Come This might have already been said - if not, it should have - but England are not going to get any better in the next two years unless things change. We're out of another competition and it's the same old story. In two years time, the situation will be exactly the same; we'll qualify relatively easily (one or two dodgy away matches aside) and go into the Euros in decent form. Some of our players will have had good domestic seasons and there will be a quiet optimism that we can perform well. Sound familiar? That's pretty much the story for almost every tournament since Euro 96. We always kid ourselves into believing that we're on the cusp of another "golden generation", as if to say: "Don't worry about this tournament lads, it's the next one that counts. You'll be better for this experience." But we won't, at least not until things change. We need to stop relying on the supposed quality of our players and start putting more emphasis on effective tactics and systems. Look at the Dutch team; how many of those players would you say are superstars? Robben and van Persie are really the only ones that fit the bill. Of the rest, you've got Leroy Fer (relegated last season), Krul, De Guzman, Vorm and Vlaar (finished 10th, 12th & 15th with Newcastle, Swansea & Villa respectively). Plus four from Feyenoord, who got knocked out in the playoffs of the Europa League. Yet see how well they play. They have got their game plan spot on - even without van Persie in the line-up they weren't affected; if anything they defended better. The same goes for teams like Chile, USA, Mexico, Ghana, Costa Rica, Columbia etc. (success being relative, of course). It doesn't matter how good we think Luke Shaw, Raheem Sterling, Phil Jones, Ross Barkley et al are going to be; if we don't get the system right, it's moot. You can have the best players in world football in your team but if you don't use them in the right way you're still going to struggle. Case in point, Portugal; they have the Ballon D'Or winner in their team, and they've only got one point, having scored just twice. It's time to start actually planning how to deal with the opposition - learning to exploit their weaknesses and defend against their strengths. Enough of just chucking whichever flavours of the week aren't injured into some random formation and hoping for the best. If it means dropping players like Rooney or Gerrard, or bringing in players from less "fashionable" teams then so be it. I'm not saying we have no chance in the Euros but unless lessons are learned from both other countries, and from this tournament in general, then it's all just a little bit of history repeating. Ted, Manchester Foster And Bentley Deserve Credit Usually I'm with Nick Miller when he writes columns but on this occasion I think he is so desperate to play devil's advocate to the accepted norm that he has confused his own argument. I agree that if a player doesn't feel pride in representing his country then he shouldn't force/fake it but equally he should make it clear that he does not want to be considered for selection rather than taking up a position that a player who wants to play could take. I have much more respect for a Ben Foster, even as with many fans I'll never understand why you wouldn't want to play, being honest about it and requesting he isn't selected than a player who accepts the call-up then doesn't bother or pulls out at every available opportunity. The Foster issue is also hugely different to David Bentley's situation. While few football fans could understand why a footballer would ever give up that life/career to many it is probably just a job that pays the bills and many of us hate our jobs, perhaps do a half-arsed job but go into work every day and pick up the pay cheque regardless. So I don't blame Bentley for that even if it would piss me off to see him continue to pick up a wage at my club and provide nothing in return. If he chooses not to even do that then he deserves some credit. To confuse either of these issues with Capello missing his son's wedding or a player wanting to miss an international because his partner is expecting is nonsense and Redknapp knew this when he stuck his oar in and Nick should see this as well and call it for the petty, pathetic score settling that it is. He wasn't appealing for paternity leave for footballers, he was kicking Hodgson and the FA when they were down. These are legitimate reasons for missing a game/work and should be treated as such so if any attitude needs to change it is for these reasons not dead grannies or fake injuries or lack of pride. Also what is with this 'Suarez has had one good season' nonsense that seems to be sneaking into the mailbox as if it is fact? The guy scored 23 goals two years ago to go with his 31 this year despite missing 10 games, that's 54 goals in 66 games. He has a one in two record at international level and was top scorer in the qualifying campaign having been named player of the tournament at the last Copa America and having an excellent 2010 World Cup. All that without including his phenomenal record at Ajax (as we all know goals in countries other than Spain, Germany, Italy, France and especially England do not count). The guy has been superb for at least the past four years and has been getting better and better year on year and the figures being rumoured are therefore absolutely fair. Regards, Lindsay, Melbourne. Neymar: He's Quite Good How good was Neymar last night?! Yes he scored two good goals, but the most impressive things I saw from him were: - Tireless running to chase down loose balls and pressurise defenders. He is clearly not a lazy flair player. - Tricks and flicks being attempted. Some came off - there was a brilliant little flick off the outside of his right foot as he pirouetted to the left at the end of the first half which almost set up an awesome goal. But it's the fact that he kept trying them that made me most impressed; no England players would have attempted a rainbow kick from just outside the box. - No f***ying about! He got a bit of a kicking, but was generally straight back up again. Didn't go to ground as easily as most players have been doing at this WC. I know it was 'only' Cameroon, but I thought he was ace. Ian (Aberdeen kick off their Europa League season next week, jeez!) Towns, MUFC Slow And Steady Wins The Race In response to Andy, London, who wrote in to highlight how the World Cup is usually won by a slow starter - I couldn't agree more. I have been evangelising this truth for the past weeks to a somewhat uninterested & stubborn audience. Most of my mates watched the first round of games and immediately concluded that the semi-finalists would be Holland, Brazil, Germany, Argentina. I too wondered if they have never watched a World Cup before. It's a hard concept to explain but it just almost always turns out that way. The thing with a tournament like the World Cup is that, firstly, it is just that - a tournament, and not a league. Five goals in your first game doesn't give you any advantage over a team that draws their first two games and scraps through by an own-goal in the third group game. Also, it is very difficult to keep up the type of pace Holland (for example) started with for seven games - heck its hard in any part of the world to go seven games unbeaten. You can lose one game in the first three and still survive, but losing one game in the last four is the end of the road. Hence, a team can't afford to have a bad game in the second two weeks, but can afford to have a bad game in the first two weeks, learn your mistakes and power on from there. Your opposition gets tougher as the tournament progresses too and someone will have studied your technique by the time you get to the QF/SF stage. The chances of injuries and suspensions increase and the loss of a key defender to suspension/injury just means one mistake from a newcomer playing their first game of the tournament means the end of a World Cup for you. There is no goal difference factor later. There are just so many variables involved - nine points from the first three games means very little. That said, it's been a belter of a World Cup. Lee (Scrap the Qatar idea and just have Brazil 2022) Moyo, Durban. Portugal: No Better Than Wales Loath as I am to defend our greasy friend, its fairly obvious that Ronaldo is not fully fit. The cross was a moment of magic which we all know he's capable of. Expect to see hissy fits galore from Bale in the Euro qualifiers with the quality of his team-mates play, as I'd have Wales on a par with Portugal, possibly better than them with Ramsey in the team.

Premier League: Southampton's Jay Rodriguez plans return from injury | Football365 | Premier League News	Jay Rodriguez says the prospect of facing former club Burnley in December is helping his motivation to return from injury as quickly as possible. Last Updated: 23/06/14 at 11:37 Post Comment Jay Rodriguez: Looking forward to Southampton’s game at Burnley The Southampton forward suffered a serious knee injury in April which ended his chances of going to the World Cup with England. The initial prognosis was that Rodriguez would be sidelined for around six months, and he has been pleased with the early part of his recovery. Rodriguez has now vowed to keep working hard in his rehabilitation to make sure he comes back quickly, and has set his sights on the trip to Turf Moor on 13 December as a game he does not want to miss. “I want to be able to be fit to play in that and go back to Burnley. That is certainly my aim,” he said in the Lancashire Telegraph. “I haven’t got a specific comeback date from injury and it is just about working through the phases at the moment. I think there are six phases to the recovery and when we get to stage six we can start looking at putting a timescale on it.  “But seeing the Burnley fixture in December definitely helps with motivation and I really want to play a part.  “It will be great to go back and see all the fans and be able to play at Turf Moor again and see some of the players and people at the club.  “The Burnley game was the first fixture I looked out for.  “I am starting to see some positives with me knee and I am feeling good about the recovery. Hopefully it will go to plan.”  Rodriguez is looking forward to working under Ronald Koeman when he returns to fitness, having seen the Dutchman take charge at St Mary’s following Mauricio Pochettino’s move to Tottenham Hotspur. “I met Ronald Koeman very briefly,” added Rodriguez. “He is obviously a legend in the game and played at the very highest level. I am excited about working with him. “He asked me how the injury was and how I was getting on. It was only a very brief chat but it was nice to be able to meet him.  “I can’t wait to get back training again and working with him and hopefully it will be a good move for Southampton to bring him in.” 	sports
World Cup: Frank Lampard unsure over England future after Costa Rica draw | News	Frank Lampard remains unsure over his international future after England’s World Cup campaign limped to a conclusion with a 0-0 draw against Costa Rica. Last Updated: 24/06/14 at 20:39 Post Comment Frank Lampard: Veteran midfielder captained England in 0-0 draw with Costa Rica The veteran midfielder, who will end his long association with Chelsea this summer, captained the side but could not lead them to victory over Costa Rica, who progress to the last 16 as Group D winners with England at the bottom of the table. With Lampard now 36, it is likely to have been his final World Cup appearance, but he insists he is yet to decide when he will call time on his career with the Three Lions. When asked about his future, he told ITV: "I don't know. I really enjoyed being involved and I love playing for my country, that's obvious. I am 36 and still doing it. "I feel fresh. If I feel I can offer something I will do but at the moment it is too soon to say." Lampard agreed with Roy Hodgson’s post-match assessment that England had been the better side and could have won the game comfortably had they taken the opportunities they created, while also paying tribute to the support of the travelling fans. He added: "It was a difficult game to approach. "I think we did everything we could do. We showed a bit of character, we prepared right for the last two days. Everyone knows how tough it's been. "It wasn't vintage but we had enough chances to win the game. I think we played some good stuff, bright stuff at times, and created enough chances to win. “We’re England, we expect more, they expect more and we didn’t deliver. England fans have been an absolute credit, it’s a shame we couldn’t do enough to take them through and give them a longer trip.”	sports

Lallana out, Tadic in? Southampton can be optimistic despite star sales - Goal.com	Though Mauricio Pochettino has gone and the likes of Luke Shaw have followed him, Ronald Koeman's work has begun cannily and the Saints have yet more talented youth on the way up COMMENT By George Ankers One by one, the crown jewels are being sold. Rickie Lambert, the talisman. Adam Lallana, the captain. Luke Shaw, the biggest talent, on par with Gareth Bale at that age. Now Arsenal are weighing up a raid of their own for £30 million pair Dejan Lovren and Morgan Schneiderlin, both of whom want to leave. Southampton have had this kind of summer before but not quite with so many departures in one go. While many have been predicting doom and gloom for the Saints since manager Mauricio Pochettino jumped ship for Tottenham, though, there is reason to be optimistic. Though the talented Argentine is a loss, the appointment of Ronald Koeman looks a canny one. The Dutchman boasts great experience of high-level football as both a player and coach; an inspirational figure whose enthusiasm for and commitment to youth makes him an ideal fit for the club’s philosophy. Koeman is set to bring with him from Feyenoord striker Graziano Pelle, a direct replacement for Lambert, who netted 50 goals in his last two seasons in the Eredivisie. The Italian clearly has a bond with his manager and, as a fluent English speaker, should have no trouble settling in. Arguably even more exciting is the likely arrival of Dusan Tadic from Twente. The Serbian winger has created 483 chances over his four years in the Dutch top flight, an incredible 178 more than any other player over the same period. Two-footed and comfortable all across the forward line, he is a remarkably similar player to Lallana - and may in fact be better - for less than half the price that Liverpool have just paid. More signings will need to follow. Southampton had one of the thinnest squads in the Premier League to begin with last season, which was the main reason why their challenge for European qualification fell away. But now they have plenty of money with which to bolster their ranks. Burnley striker Danny Ings, a boyhood Saints fan, is understood to be one such target. There are more potential sales to fear, of course, but though both Gunners targets have indicated a desire to leave, Saints are now quite publicly in no desperate need for funds. If Arsenal or Napoli or anyone else wants Schneiderlin, it will have to be for a very good price. Schneiderlin is a key player for Southampton, one whom they have developed brilliantly from a gangly 18-year-old, but a huge fee to reinvest alongside the ever-impressive Jack Cork and improving Victor Wanyama would be no disaster. The same goes for Lovren – be it Arsenal or Liverpool who push hardest for him, the south-coast side can demand serious money. At least one new centre-back would likely have been required anyway. Jay Rodriguez, the last left of their English forward triumvirate, is reported to be a target for Pochettino’s Spurs but his continuing recovery from injury might be enough to keep him at St Mary’s Stadium for the summer at least. While Koeman flexes his muscles with as much raised cash as he eventually gets, it is important not to forget that Saints still have their widely admired production line churning out talented youngsters like a hydra - buy one and two more sprout up in their place. James Ward-Prowse should step into a key role this season. Nathaniel Clyne and Calum Chambers can either continue a duel for the right-back slot that should put both in England contention imminently or switch one to the left and emulate Jon Flanagan’s conversion. Sam Gallagher scored his first Premier League goal last term and will look to kick on as a more serious squad player from hereon in. Behind them, there are high hopes for Harrison Reed, an emerging central midfielder. Lloyd Isgrove and Omar Rowe are exciting options on the wing. Matt Targett is the latest 18-year-old with a bright future at left-back. Attacking midfielder Sam McQueen made his first-team debut in the FA Cup. The coaching staff, too, has been renewed wisely under Koeman and his brother and assistant, Erwin. Sammy Lee has joined as an assistant coach while England goalkeeping coach Dave Watson has taken up a similar role at St Mary’s. For Southampton, all of this has happened before and all of this will happen again. Though it is a crying shame to see one of their best ever group of players dismantled – Lambert’s exit being a particularly unexpected blow, though fans are largely supportive of his latest fairytale opportunity – the club are in a better position than ever before to still be standing proud when the dust has settled. Relegation? There are a lot of poor teams in the Premier League. Last season’s record-breaking exploits may be difficult to repeat but, if Koeman can gel his new-look squad together quickly enough, Saints should be hopeful of more than just safety.

Lallana out, Tadic in? Southampton can be optimistic despite star sales - Goal.com	Though Mauricio Pochettino has gone and the likes of Luke Shaw have followed him, Ronald Koeman's work has begun cannily and the Saints have yet more talented youth on the way up COMMENT By George Ankers One by one, the crown jewels are being sold. Rickie Lambert, the talisman. Adam Lallana, the captain. Luke Shaw, the biggest talent, on par with Gareth Bale at that age. Now Arsenal are weighing up a raid of their own for £30 million pair Dejan Lovren and Morgan Schneiderlin, both of whom want to leave. Southampton have had this kind of summer before but not quite with so many departures in one go.

Schurrle: I will give away secrets on how to face David Luiz - Goal.com	The Chelsea forward knows Oscar, Willian, Ramires and David Luiz from Stamford Bridge and is ready to give away secrets ahead of the World Cup semi-final clash on Tuesday By Greg Stobart in Rio de Janeiro Germany forward Andre Schurrle will give his team-mates secrets on how to face David Luiz and his other friends in the Brazil team ahead of the World Cup semi-final in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday. Schurrle plays with Oscar, Willian and Ramires at Chelsea, while Luiz has just left the Blues to sign for Paris Saint-Germain and scored a stunning free-kick in Brazil's 2-1 quarter-final victory over Colombia on Friday. Schurrle admits he has not been in contact with the Brazilian players during the World Cup because they are now ‘rivals’ and will give his Germany team-mates tips as they look to book a place in the final. "Of course, if somebody asks me how to play against Oscar or David Luiz, I’m here to help," Schurrle said. "We haven’t been in touch during the tournament. We are rivals here so there have not been any text messages. "For me it will be cool to play against my Brazilian friends from Chelsea." Germany booked their semi-final spot with a 1-0 win over France at the Maracana on Friday thanks to a first-half header from defender Mats Hummels. Joachim Low’s side have faced some criticism for the level of their performances during the World Cup but Schurrle believes Germany have proved their winning mentality in the tournament. He added: "We have quality, it’s not just luck or the DNA of the players. We have had some tight matches, but we have deserved to win every game we have won. That was the case against France as well. "The best thing about the team is that we win. We fight and give everything we have. We have good players and we win in the end, that’s the most important thing."	sports

Thiago Silva backs Willian to fill Neymar role against Germany - Goal.com	The Brazil captain feels that the Chelsea forward would be the ideal replacement for the injured striker after he suffered a fractured vertebra against Colombia Thiago Silva believes that Willian is capable of filling the void left by Neymar when Brazil face Germany in the World Cup semi-finals on Tuesday. The Selecao progressed beyond the quarter-finals after a 2-1 win over Colombia in Fortaleza, with Silva and David Luiz both on the scoresheet, while los Cafeteros struck through a James Rodriguez penalty. Despite making their way past Colombia, Brazil were dealt a blow when Neymar was carried off with a broken bone in his back and was ruled out of the rest of the tournament, though Silva hopes that Willian can ensure his absence is not felt too keenly "Neymar is a boy who dreamed so much of this time," Paris Saint-Germain defender told reporters. "I don't know yet if [Juan Zuniga's challenge] was malicious or not, but it is impossible to take a ball that is in front of the opponent. There's no way you get your knee and you go through him. "I'm sure we have good spare parts. I believe very much in Willian, who has almost the same features as Neymar and believe in this moment he will fill the gap very well. This is where we have to show the strength of the group." Silva, who himself miss the game with Germany through suspension, has urged Brazil to show the depth and quality of their squad when they face Germany, believing unity can take them to the final in the Maracana. "It's difficult," the 29-year-old continued. "We've lost our standout player. I believe one of the most important players when it comes to the World Cup. But the group must be stronger than the individual. We must be prepared, regardless of any absences."	sports
Maradona: Argentina leave a lot to be desired - Goal.com	The Albiceleste legend has criticised the performances of his compatriots in the World Cup so far, believing that a host of stars have failed to deliver in Brazil so far Diego Maradona has given a scathing assessment of Argentina's displays at the World Cup, insisting that some key players need to show improvement against Belgium. The Albiceleste struggled past Switzerland in their last-16 tie, relying on a 118th-minute strike from Angel Di Maria to avoid going into penalties in Sao Paulo. Maradona expressed his disappointment with Argentina's performances overall, stressing that, though it is natural for the players to look to Lionel Messi for inspiration, many have to step up in their quarter-final with Belgium. "Alejandro Sabella's team leaves a lot to be desired on the overall front," he wrote in his column for the Times of India. "[Gonzalo] Higuain is yet to score despite playing in all four matches. I remember him getting goals after being set up by Messi in 2010. "The uncertainty over [Sergio] Aguero and [Ezequiel] Lavezzi's form continue to be a cause for concern, while [Angel] Di Maria keeps blowing hot and cold. "There will be two or three marking Messi, and others in the attack will have to capitalise on the gaps left open because of that. "Argentina are relying heavily on Messi and why not? When you have Leo in the team, you should exploit that advantage. "Messi has at last found his best touch in the biggest tournament. Argentina couldn't have asked for more, but they need him to continue in this vein." The 1986 World Cup winners also reminisced about his own clashes with Belgium, most notably the semi-final win in 1986 where he scored twice, but stressed that this generation of Red Devils are superior to the sides he faced. "A quarter-final between Argentina and Belgium takes me down memory lane," he continued. "I made my World Cup debut against them in 1982. We were the defending champions and they beat us 1-0. I was mercilessly tackled. I got my revenge in 1986 and scored twice in our 2-0 victory in the semi-finals. "This Belgian bunch is stronger with lots of young talent. [Thibault] Courtois is one of the most promising goalkeepers. The back four led by [Vincent] Kompany has been solid and [Jan] Vertonghen keeps the left corridor going. "[Kevin] De Bruyne is a powerful lad at the centre, while [Eden] Hazard has improved a lot playing in the English Premier League.

Podolski: Germany don't have a star like Neymar - Goal.com	The striker feels his side operate much better as a unit than Brazil, who have lost their star player for the remainder of the tournament By Greg Stobart in Rio de Janeiro Lukas Podolski has admitted that Germany do not boast a star player like Neymar but he believes their collective strength can secure a place in the World Cup final. Germany face hosts Brazil in the semi-final in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday after both teams won their quarter-final matches on Friday. Naymar has been the star of the Brazil side in the tournament, scoring four goals in four five games before he broke a vertebra in Friday's win over Colombia, bringing his tournament to an end. The injury comes as a huge blow as they lose their main source of creativity and goals. And Podolski feels are much better as a Unit than Brazil, as they do not rely on individuals, but feels they must now prove they are the best team in the world. “We feel that we don’t have players like Messi or Neymar who can make a goal with one special movement, but we have a strong team,” Podolski said. “Everyone sticks together and this is important. “You are only the best team in the world when you win the World Cup. When you lose the semi-final, you are out. So we have to win. We play to win. “Of course, to play against Brazil in Brazil will be a special game. It will be a great game for the world but we have two matches to go and we want the title. “We can be the first European team to win a World Cup in South America. It won’t be easy because a lot of European teams are out, but we are here and we are strong. “The World Cup is not a competition where the team that plays the best football wins the tournament.”	sports

Sneijder urges Netherlands not to underestimate Costa Rica - Goal.com	The Galatasaray midfielder insists that his side must afford their quarter-final opponents the appropriate respect, acknowledging that there are no guarantees of victory Wesley Sneijder has encouragedNetherlands to ensure they do not assume they can ease past Costa Rica when the sides meet on Saturday. Los Ticos have been the surprise package of this World Cup, defeating Uruguay and Italy on the way to topping Group D before earning a 5-3 victory on penalties against Greece in the last 16. Sneijder was quick to reject the suggestion that the Oranje would have a simple task against the Central American nation, saying that they have earned the right to be considered among the eight best countries in world football by reaching the quarter-finals. "They are in the last eight of the World Cup," the 30-year-old told the Times of India. "That says that they are among the eight best football playing countries. Every match at this stage starts as 50-50. The difference is so little among the teams, anything can happen on a given day. "And Costa Rica had topped the group sending two European giants Italy and England home.  So, there will be too many things to play for." The Dutch, beaten finalists in the 2010 edition of the World Cup where they lost 1-0 to Spain, remain among the favourites for the trophy but Arjen Robben added that they must improve from their second-round win over Mexico to realise that aim. "I thought during the first half we weren't good when Mexico had possession," the winger told reporters. "That will have to improve against Costa Rica. In general, I think we were stronger when we had the ball, so that's a plus. We have to do that more. We let Mexico play a bit too much. "I think we are on a mission together and when you come to a World Cup it's not to enjoy the weather and enjoy the beach in Rio. You’re here to win matches and to go as far as possible. "I don’t think the expectations were that high before the tournament and as a result we can be very proud of where we are."	sports

James Rodriguez: Men can also cry - Goal.com	The Colombia forward was emotional after his side's 2-1 quarter-final defeat to Brazil on Friday, explaining that he was overcome by pride at their World Cup displays James Rodriguez insisted that his tears after Colombia's World Cup exit came because his side had given everything they could in the tournament. Los Cafeteros fell to a 2-1 defeat in Fortaleza, with Thago Silva and David Luiz both scoring for the Selecao, while James' second-half penalty was the only response they could muster. The 22-year-old Monaco attacker was consoled by David Luiz after the final whistle and explained that his emotional response was borne out of the great effort he and his teammates had put into the entire competition. "I'm crying because we gave everything we had inside of us," he told reporters after the game. "We have not progressed to the semi-finals. The referee did not always whistle in the right direction and did not penalise many of Brazil's misdemeanours. But we go out with our heads held high. "Men can also cry. But I can return to my country happy. A great team has been born." James, who is the tournament's top scorer with six goals, has inspired Colombia to their best ever World Cup performance and also revealed what David Luiz had said when he comforted him after the defeat. "He congratulated me for my World Cup," the former Porto man said. "He told me I was a good player. The truth is that having so many superstars hugging me did make me happy. We have to raise our heads now and thank Colombia for their support. "We are sad because we wanted to keep going and set new records. We gave everything to reach the semi-final, but we have to be proud because we played a great side."	sports
James Rodriguez: Men can also cry - Goal.com	The Colombia forward was emotional after his side's 2-1 quarter-final defeat to Brazil on Friday, explaining that he was overcome by pride at their World Cup displays James Rodriguez insisted that his tears after Colombia's World Cup exit came because his side had given everything they could in the tournament. Los Cafeteros fell to a 2-1 defeat in Fortaleza, with Thago Silva and David Luiz both scoring for the Selecao, while James' second-half penalty was the only response they could muster.

Schurrle: I will give away secrets on how to face David Luiz - Goal.com	The Chelsea forward knows Oscar, Willian, Ramires and David Luiz from Stamford Bridge and is ready to give away secrets ahead of the World Cup semi-final clash on Tuesday By Greg Stobart in Rio de Janeiro Germany forward Andre Schurrle will give his team-mates secrets on how to face David Luiz and his other friends in the Brazil team ahead of the World Cup semi-final in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday. Schurrle plays with Oscar, Willian and Ramires at Chelsea, while Luiz has just left the Blues to sign for Paris Saint-Germain and scored a stunning free-kick in Brazil's 2-1 quarter-final victory over Colombia on Friday. Schurrle admits he has not been in contact with the Brazilian players during the World Cup because they are now ‘rivals’ and will give his Germany team-mates tips as they look to book a place in the final. "Of course, if somebody asks me how to play against Oscar or David Luiz, I’m here to help," Schurrle said. "We haven’t been in touch during the tournament. We are rivals here so there have not been any text messages. "For me it will be cool to play against my Brazilian friends from Chelsea." Germany booked their semi-final spot with a 1-0 win over France at the Maracana on Friday thanks to a first-half header from defender Mats Hummels. Joachim Low’s side have faced some criticism for the level of their performances during the World Cup but Schurrle believes Germany have proved their winning mentality in the tournament. He added: "We have quality, it’s not just luck or the DNA of the players. We have had some tight matches, but we have deserved to win every game we have won. That was the case against France as well. "The best thing about the team is that we win. We fight and give everything we have. We have good players and we win in the end, that’s the most important thing."	sports

Messi can't win the World Cup on his own - Ardiles - Goal.com	The Argentina great believes the Albiceleste need to rely on the forward less and other players need to begin to contribute if they are to have a successful World Cup Ossie Ardiles believes that Argentina are over-reliant on Lionel Messi and the rest of the players need to step up when they meet Belgium on Saturday. The Barcelona forward has been integral to the Albieceleste's progress so far, scoring four of his side's seven goals and leading them to a quarter-final encounter with Belgium. However, Ardiles feels that Alejandro Sabella's team is running the risk of becoming completely dependent on their star player and others need to take some of the burden from his shoulders by delivering better performances. "At the moment [Argentina] look like they have just one tactic: Give the ball to Messi and he will do the rest!," the 61-year-old wrote in his column for the Times of India. "Yes, Messi has had a wonderful tournament. He has been named man of the match in every game. So far, so good. But we need the rest of the team to do a lot more. "Messi cannot win the World Cup on his own. Belgium will not come on to just defend, but also attack when they can. They are going to test the Argentina defence a lot more than the other teams. That's why this is going to be a very tricky game for us. "We cannot keep depending on 'Messi Magic' and the rest of them need to step up now. The only ones who have done this are [Angel] Di Maria and [Javier] Mascherano, who has been doing a good job in the defence. "We need more up front especially from [Ezequiel] Lavezzi and [Gonzalo] Higuain, who has played all four games but been pretty much absent." Ardiles, who was a World Cup winner in 1978, warned his compatriots that Belgium will be a tough proposition in the quarter-final's and could upset Argentina's chances of becoming world champions for a third time if they don't improve. "Belgium are the dark horses, and I think they are happy to be so," he said of Marc Wilmots' side. "Yes, Argentina are the favourites to go through but the margin is going to be very small. They could be `surprised', but I wouldn't call it one as Belgium are equipped to produce some very good football. "Belgium call themselves the "golden generation," the best team that they have had.  They are going to be very tough, dangerous, and go all out against us. "All their tactics will be about how to stop Messi. That would be every team's plan. But having a plan is one thing, making it actually work is another."	sports
Vidal would cost £45m plus Nani, Manchester United told - Goal.com	The Red Devils could turn their attention back to €46m-rated Sporting Lisbon defensive midfielder William Carvalho after being quoted a huge fee by Juventus for the Chilean By Paul Clennam Juventus have told Manchester United they will have to pay €56 million for Arturo Vidal - and include Nani in a player-plus-cash deal - if they want to sign the Chile international, Goal understands. United are in the market for a central midfielder this summer, with Louis van Gaal a known admirer of Vidal. But the €56m fee quoted to executive vice chairman Ed Woodward's camp could prove to be too much for the Red Devils after already signing Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera for a combined total in excess of €70m. Instead, United look likely to turn their attention back to Sporting Lisbon defensive midfielder William Carvalho. Both Manchester clubs have been monitoring Carvalho for several months and, while he would prove a cheaper option for Van Gaal, the Portugal international would still cost the Red Devils €46m. Sporting director Augusto Ignacio recently revealed that Carvalho could leave the club but hinted that they would receive a substantial transfer fee for any sale. "It's not like the old days when players left Sporting at any price," Ignacio told the Portuguese club's official TV channel. "We are not concerned with William Carvalho because we have alternatives who will want to play as well. "The termination clause ensures a great deal to Sporting. I am very pleased with the negotiations. "It is not easy to negotiate for players - you need to be very shrewd - but Sporting have a president who knows how to negotiate with anyone and what is best for the club."	sports

Hulk: We'll dedicate World Cup win to Neymar - Goal.com	The Brazil forward expressed his sadness after the 22-year-old was ruled out of the tournament through injury, but insists his absence will give his side added motivation Hulk believes that Brazil can overcome the blow dealt to them by Neymar's injury, adding that it gives his side an "extra reason" to succeed. The Selecao progressed to a World Cup semi-final with Germany after defeating Colombia on Saturday evening, with Thiago Silva and David Luiz both scoring in the 2-1 win, as los Cafeteros only managed a James Rodriguez penalty in response. However, from a Brazilian perspective, the game was blighted by seeing Neymar stretchered off with a fractured vertebra after a clash with Juan Zuniga, and Hulk urged his teammates to secure the World Cup to ease his disappointment. "It's sad, he took care of himself for this World Cup, and was very excited about it," the Zenit St. Petersburg attacker told reporters. "Not to mention he's very important for the Selecao. We have to try and overcome this. Now we have an extra reason to give it all, for Neymar, for the guy he is. If God helps us, we'll be champions, so we can dedicate this title to him." Hulk was among the Verde-Amarela players to concede the injury was a bitter blow to their apspirations, with Oscar admitting that the striker, who scored four times in the tournament prior to the Colombia game, would be a big loss. "He's incredible not only in the pitch, but also off it," the Chelsea attacking midfielder added. "We'll miss him, but whoever comes in will have to give its best. We can't be sad, we are in a World Cup semi-final. We played a great match today, and whoever comes in, we have to play collectively to try and beat Germany." Fernandinho also echoed his teammates' sentiments, but stressed that they must continue to believe in their collective strength rather than individual talent when they face Germany in their semi-final on Tuesday in Belo Horizonte. "Since the beginning, even if Neymar was shining bright, the group was the real "leading man"," he insisted. "We played as a team, united, battling our way until the end at every match. This won't change now. Brazil's protagonist is the group."	sports

World Cup bids farewell to two of its shining stars - Goal.com	Colombia's exit brought an end to James Rodriguez's wonder run during the tournament whereas Neymar's injury leaves a massive void in the Brazilian camp... COMMENT By Shikharr Chandra The World Cup so far has been dominated by individual magic, goals and well, more goals. The flair of attacking talent that has dawned the fields of Brazil over the past few weeks has been spell bounding to say the least. The game against Brazil and Colombia looked to be another one of those games that would have drama, goals and of course some eye catching moments by some of the finest players. The game was billed as battle between two of the best players of the World Cup so far. Colombia's poster boy, James Rodriguez and the young Neymar on whom lies the hopes of an entire nation. Of the same age, both were subject to a multimillion transfer last season and while they didn’t really live up to the hype that surrounded them at club level due to injuries, World Cup came as a chance to show what European football missed for most part of last season. The immense pressure that these young players carried going into the World Cup was inconceivable. Neymar was expected to win the World Cup for the host nation while Rodriguez carried the burden on his shoulders in the absence of Radamel Falcao. As thousands gathered around Fortaleza in enthusiasm, both sets of supporters were left desolated in the end. Although Brazil made their way into the final four, they had paid a hefty price in the form of Neymar’s injury. The game was seen as a chance for both Luiz Felipe Scolari and Jose Pekerman to showcase their tactical nous as they looked to come up with a plan to stop the opposite number 10. However it turned out to be a physical battle. For Colombia it was an end to an enchanting dream that had seen them beat some of the finest teams, play attractive football and of course, the brilliance of 'Ha-mez' Rodriguez. They surpassed expectations and gave new belief to the country for the upcoming international tournaments. Colombia now have their own marquee player to look up to and seek inspiration from. At full time, the Colombians stood on the ground dejected as David Luiz and Dani Alves solicited a huge round of applause for the Monaco forward. He had earned the respect of the entire footballing fraternity with his memorable show in the tournament despite his tender age. ‘El Nuevo Pibe’ has given us a lot of memories to cherish. The game against Uruguay that was pre-dominantly surrounded by the Luis Suarez saga was soon forgotten as the former Porto star scored arguably the goal of the tournament. He dominated headlines, attracted interest from some of the best clubs and sparked fear in the opposition. This was evident in Fortaleza when he was jeered as his name was read before the kick-off. The Colombian was not able to emulate the same magic against Brazil as he has done throughout the tournament. Despite scoring a late penalty to give the fans a glimmer of hope, Rodriguez and co had little to cherish about at the end of the final whistle. The charismatic forward was battered and bruised throughout the game as Scolari's plan to put Fernandinho on Rodriguez paid dividends.   But as the Colombian bid farewell to Brazil, the host nation bid farewell to their own poster boy, Neymar. The appreciation and the love the country has for Neymar knows no boundaries. Every television channel or a billboard has the smiling face of the youngster. He is their most gifted player and the one who would bring back the much coveted cup back after 12 long years. But all dreams seem to have shattered as Juan Zuniga's rash challenge brought an end to his time at the World Cup and quite possibly the country's hopes. It is little secret that the Barcelona forward was the man carrying the Selecao for so long. With four goals in the tournament, he was more than capable of hiding the obvious flaws in the side.  Brazil’s attack has been the weakest in over a decade. The likes of Fred and Jo don’t inspire much belief while Oscar has been poor except for the opening game against Croatia. For all his energy, Hulk doesn’t score enough goals which leaves Scolari with little options upfront. Against Colombia, it was their two centre-backs, namely Thiago Silva and David Luiz who bailed them with a couple of goals. Neymar, like Rodriguez, fell victim to the physical approach. Where does this leave Brazil? Who can take over the mantle now? Scolari has the likes of Willian and Bernard in his ranks to provide that magic but they are not of the same class as the former Santos player. He made the team tick on his own, he provided that moment of inspiration which no one else has so far for the Selecao in attack. Up against an organized German side now in the semifinals, Brazil's journey could come to an untimely halt. As one star left the field with tears, the other left on a stretcher. The World Cup that has given us so much to cherish about was not supposed to end in such a way. It’s a shame that we won't get to see another minute of them in the tournament. The shining stars bid farewell and will be deeply missed.  	sports
Time for the real Belgium to stand up - Goal.com	COMMENT: They may have a 100 per cent record so far, but Marc Wilmots and his side have yet to play to their strengths at this World Cup By Kris Voakes in Sao Paulo Belgium’s World Cup campaign has been one long contradiction thus far. They came into the competition being completely overhyped as fifth-favourites, one of the top eight seeds, and a squad full of young stars from all across Europe’s top leagues. Nobody seemed to take into account their lack of tournament experience, their unknown capabilities in forming well as a group over a lengthy period, nor what their default style of play would be and how that might work in different game scenarios. Instead people immediately looked at names such as Eden Hazard, Romelu Lukaku, Dries Mertens, Kevin De Bruyne and Kevin Mirallas, and immediately convinced themselves that the Red Devils would be among the tournament’s most exciting outfits. Fast-forward four games, and they have racked up a 100 per cent record yet seemingly lost their lustre in the eyes of those who were previously backing them. Their largely pragmatic approach has been at odds with the comparatively carefree nature of the tournament as a whole, drawing criticism for how they have gone about their business against teams they were expected to beat. But, with four wins from four, Marc Wilmots has been entirely justified in his decision to play things cautiously, and the national coach was quick to point that out after their victory over South Korea in Sao Paulo. "It’s no easy task to finish the group stage with nine points. It’s a truly historic achievement for Belgium, and I’d like to congratulate the staff and all the players,” said Wilmots. "We're here to win, not to play beautiful football, and we've accomplished our mission." Midfielder Moussa Dembele added that same night that the end justifies the means. “It’s maybe not the sexiest football we’ve shown but we’re very happy with nine points out of nine,” he told Goal. Even the round of 16 victory over USA has not been enough to quell the murmurings of doubters unhappy at the way they have approached the tournament so far, with many pointing to the fact that they were a Chris Wondolowski miss and an offside flag away from elimination. But Mirallas told Goal this week that as the tournament progresses, the qualities Belgium possess will have more opportunity to come out, allowing the likes of Hazard and Lukaku the kind of space they revel in at club level. "It’s true. Earlier in the competition we played teams who played in a very closed way and gave us a great deal of difficulty in playing out attacking game," he admitted. "It’s true that against the USA, we had more space to play our attacking game and we were quite a bit more dangerous, we created many chances. So against Argentina it’s certain that they will try to play the game and will try to control the match, but even if we have more space it will still be a very difficult game for us." And he has a point. Only when Jurgen Klinsmann’s side began to smell blood in extra-time did Belgium really begin to get some space in the final third for the first time at this World Cup, and they made that work in their favour. So against Argentina, who will look to force the game themselves, finally Wilmots should have some more licence to send his side out in a more attacking manner than has been the case so far. Being a team that benefits from pace on the counter-attack means depending on the opposition wanting to take the game to you as a natural instinct rather than a secondary thought. And as such, taking on Alejandro Sabella’s star-studded side should suit Belgium’s natural game to a tee. They may have a faultless record in terms of results so far, but Saturday’s quarter-final is the first true test of the real Belgium. If they fail to bring out the best in themselves in Salvador, they will be left wondering what might have happened if only they really gone for it. It is time for one of the World Cup’s most talented groups to show what they are truly made of. Follow Kris Voakes on	sports

Of the same age, both were subject to a multimillion transfer last season and while they didn’t really live up to the hype that surrounded them at club level due to injuries, World Cup came as a chance to show what European football missed for most part of last season. The immense pressure that these young players carried going into the World Cup was inconceivable. Neymar was expected to win the World Cup for the host nation while Rodriguez carried the burden on his shoulders in the absence of Radamel Falcao. As thousands gathered around Fortaleza in enthusiasm, both sets of supporters were left desolated in the end. Although Brazil made their way into the final four, they had paid a hefty price in the form of Neymar’s injury. The game was seen as a chance for both Luiz Felipe Scolari and Jose Pekerman to showcase their tactical nous as they looked to come up with a plan to stop the opposite number 10. However it turned out to be a physical battle. For Colombia it was an end to an enchanting dream that had seen them beat some of the finest teams, play attractive football and of course, the brilliance of 'Ha-mez' Rodriguez. They surpassed expectations and gave new belief to the country for the upcoming international tournaments. Colombia now have their own marquee player to look up to and seek inspiration from. At full time, the Colombians stood on the ground dejected as David Luiz and Dani Alves solicited a huge round of applause for the Monaco forward. He had earned the respect of the entire footballing fraternity with his memorable show in the tournament despite his tender age. ‘El Nuevo Pibe’ has given us a lot of memories to cherish. The game against Uruguay that was pre-dominantly surrounded by the Luis Suarez saga was soon forgotten as the former Porto star scored arguably the goal of the tournament. He dominated headlines, attracted interest from some of the best clubs and sparked fear in the opposition. This was evident in Fortaleza when he was jeered as his name was read before the kick-off. The Colombian was not able to emulate the same magic against Brazil as he has done throughout the tournament. Despite scoring a late penalty to give the fans a glimmer of hope, Rodriguez and co had little to cherish about at the end of the final whistle. The charismatic forward was battered and bruised throughout the game as Scolari's plan to put Fernandinho on Rodriguez paid dividends.   But as the Colombian bid farewell to Brazil, the host nation bid farewell to their own poster boy, Neymar. The appreciation and the love the country has for Neymar knows no boundaries. Every television channel or a billboard has the smiling face of the youngster. He is their most gifted player and the one who would bring back the much coveted cup back after 12 long years. But all dreams seem to have shattered as Juan Zuniga's rash challenge brought an end to his time at the World Cup and quite possibly the country's hopes. It is little secret that the Barcelona forward was the man carrying the Selecao for so long. With four goals in the tournament, he was more than capable of hiding the obvious flaws in the side.  Brazil’s attack has been the weakest in over a decade. The likes of Fred and Jo don’t inspire much belief while Oscar has been poor except for the opening game against Croatia. For all his energy, Hulk doesn’t score enough goals which leaves Scolari with little options upfront. Against Colombia, it was their two centre-backs, namely Thiago Silva and David Luiz who bailed them with a couple of goals. Neymar, like Rodriguez, fell victim to the physical approach. Where does this leave Brazil? Who can take over the mantle now? Scolari has the likes of Willian and Bernard in his ranks to provide that magic but they are not of the same class as the former Santos player. He made the team tick on his own, he provided that moment of inspiration which no one else has so far for the Selecao in attack. Up against an organized German side now in the semifinals, Brazil's journey could come to an untimely halt. As one star left the field with tears, the other left on a stretcher. The World Cup that has given us so much to cherish about was not supposed to end in such a way. It’s a shame that we won't get to see another minute of them in the tournament. The shining stars bid farewell and will be deeply missed.  	sports
Hulk: We'll dedicate World Cup win to Neymar - Goal.com	The Brazil forward expressed his sadness after the 22-year-old was ruled out of the tournament through injury, but insists his absence will give his side added motivation Hulk believes that Brazil can overcome the blow dealt to them by Neymar's injury, adding that it gives his side an "extra reason" to succeed. The Selecao progressed to a World Cup semi-final with Germany after defeating Colombia on Saturday evening, with Thiago Silva and David Luiz both scoring in the 2-1 win, as los Cafeteros only managed a James Rodriguez penalty in response. However, from a Brazilian perspective, the game was blighted by seeing Neymar stretchered off with a fractured vertebra after a clash with Juan Zuniga, and Hulk urged his teammates to secure the World Cup to ease his disappointment. "It's sad, he took care of himself for this World Cup, and was very excited about it," the Zenit St. Petersburg attacker told reporters. "Not to mention he's very important for the Selecao. We have to try and overcome this. Now we have an extra reason to give it all, for Neymar, for the guy he is. If God helps us, we'll be champions, so we can dedicate this title to him." Hulk was among the Verde-Amarela players to concede the injury was a bitter blow to their apspirations, with Oscar admitting that the striker, who scored four times in the tournament prior to the Colombia game, would be a big loss. "He's incredible not only in the pitch, but also off it," the Chelsea attacking midfielder added. "We'll miss him, but whoever comes in will have to give its best. We can't be sad, we are in a World Cup semi-final. We played a great match today, and whoever comes in, we have to play collectively to try and beat Germany." Fernandinho also echoed his teammates' sentiments, but stressed that they must continue to believe in their collective strength rather than individual talent when they face Germany in their semi-final on Tuesday in Belo Horizonte. "Since the beginning, even if Neymar was shining bright, the group was the real "leading man"," he insisted. "We played as a team, united, battling our way until the end at every match. This won't change now. Brazil's protagonist is the group."	sports
Window Watch: Why Alexis Sanchez could be Wenger's defining Arsenal signing - Goal.com	The Barcelona forward can revitalise the north Londoners' immediate fortunes while Liverpool will be searching for a Luis Suarez replacement By Wayne Veysey | UK Correspondent ALEXIS SANCHEZ COULD BE WENGER'S DEFINING SIGNING Arsenal's two-year search to replace Robin van Persie has been a lengthy and frustrating one. But with a €40 million deal for Alexis Sanchez edging tantalisingly closer, the Gunners could finally have a forward worthy of following in the footsteps of the Dutchman and his iconic predecessors, Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp and Ian Wright. Signing Sanchez would transform not only Arsenal's front line but also their immediate fortunes. A team who, with Olivier Giroud as their lone spearhead, too often look slow against marquee opponents, especially during Theo Walcott's frequent injury absences, are increasingly confident of having the luxury of calling on a forward capable of scaring all defences. A technically gifted speedster with an eye for goal, Alexis is set to make way at Barcelona to free up funds for the €88m signing of Luis Suarez. Yet his transfer-market availability is no reflection of his standing. Only Lionel Messi scored more than the Chilean's 21 Barcelona goals last season and he was a player in demand even before a series of outstanding World Cup displays further enhanced his reputation. The prospect of Aaron Ramsey, Mesut Ozil, Santi Cazorla, Jack Wilshere and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain linking up with Alexis is a lip-smackingly enticing one. Gunners fans, wary of Arsene Wenger's innate caution in the market and the number of deals for strikers that have fallen through for the club in the last two years, could be forgiven for reining in their excitement. Only when the white smoke starts puffing out of the Emirates Stadium can the celebrations at an audacious signing begin. TIME FOR LIVERPOOL TO FIND SUAREZ REPLACEMENT It has been a whirlwind start to the window for Liverpool. They have completed the signings of Adam Lallana, Emre Can and Rickie Lambert and are close to finalising a deal to sell Suarez to Barcelona. With the Uruguayan's move set to be a straight cash deal, the focus will turn to the club finding a blue-chip replacement. Accepting that Suarez is irreplaceable, Liverpool would have known when they agreed the release clause that was inserted in the Uruguayan's contract last December that there was a reasonable chance that it would be triggered this summer by a more wealthy and glamorous club. It is the task of Liverpool's tier of recruitment executives, working from the information of their network of scouts, to source the next Suarez - easier said than done in a global market where secret superstars are virtually non-existent. Highly promising Belgium striker Divock Origi is set to join from Lille, although a mooted loan back may now be on the backburner following the Suarez developments. Yet Liverpool need a ready-made forward star rather than a potential one if they are not to move backwards following their astonishing improvement last season. Alexis, two years younger and €48m cheaper than Suarez, could be that man, although there is little optimism at Anfield that he will choose Liverpool ahead of his other suitors. With money to burn, the onus is now on Liverpool to recruit a mobile and technically gifted goalscorer who will fit into Brendan Rodgers's playing style. Assuming that Lambert will be third choice behind Daniel Sturridge and Suarez's successor, the Merseysiders now need to demonstrate that their knack for procuring top-notch attacking talent remains.	sports
Sneijder urges Netherlands not to underestimate Costa Rica - Goal.com	The Galatasaray midfielder insists that his side must afford their quarter-final opponents the appropriate respect, acknowledging that there are no guarantees of victory Wesley Sneijder has encouragedNetherlands to ensure they do not assume they can ease past Costa Rica when the sides meet on Saturday. Los Ticos have been the surprise package of this World Cup, defeating Uruguay and Italy on the way to topping Group D before earning a 5-3 victory on penalties against Greece in the last 16. Sneijder was quick to reject the suggestion that the Oranje would have a simple task against the Central American nation, saying that they have earned the right to be considered among the eight best countries in world football by reaching the quarter-finals. "They are in the last eight of the World Cup," the 30-year-old told the Times of India. "That says that they are among the eight best football playing countries. Every match at this stage starts as 50-50. The difference is so little among the teams, anything can happen on a given day. "And Costa Rica had topped the group sending two European giants Italy and England home.  So, there will be too many things to play for." The Dutch, beaten finalists in the 2010 edition of the World Cup where they lost 1-0 to Spain, remain among the favourites for the trophy but Arjen Robben added that they must improve from their second-round win over Mexico to realise that aim. "I thought during the first half we weren't good when Mexico had possession," the winger told reporters. "That will have to improve against Costa Rica. In general, I think we were stronger when we had the ball, so that's a plus. We have to do that more. We let Mexico play a bit too much. "I think we are on a mission together and when you come to a World Cup it's not to enjoy the weather and enjoy the beach in Rio. You’re here to win matches and to go as far as possible. "I don’t think the expectations were that high before the tournament and as a result we can be very proud of where we are."	sports
Messi to Neymar: I hope you recover soon - Goal.com	The Argentina forward expresses his support for his Barcelona teammate after he was ruled out of the World Cup after suffering a fractured vertebra against Colombia Lionel Messi has sent a personal message of support to Neymar after the Brazil star's World Cup was brought to a premature end through injury. The 22-year-old suffered a broken vertebra after taking a knee in the back from Colombia's Juan Zuniga during the Selecao's 2-1 quarter-final win in Fortaleza on Friday evening. Shortly after the news broke that he would take no further part in the tournament, numerous prominent names in football sent messages to the forward, and Messi was also keen to pass on his best wishes to his Barcelona team-mate. "Neymar, I hope you recover soon, buddy!" the Argentinian wrote on his Facebook page. The former Santos attacker had enjoyed an impressive World Cup prior to his spinal injury, scoring four times for Verde-Amarela, but will now miss his side's semi-final with Germany on Tuesday. Messi, meanwhile, is set to feature in Argentina's quarter-final clash with Belgium on Saturday as the Albiceleste look to try and become world champions for a third time.	sports
‘It sends a shiver down your spine’ – Pallister’s pride at wearing the Manchester United shirt - Goal.com	The former defender discusses what it means to don the colours of the UK’s biggest football club as they prepare to embark on a new era with shirt sponsors Chevrolet Manchester United have worn red shirts at home matches for the last 80 years, during which time they have become arguably the most iconic jerseys of any sports team in history. The size and influence of the club is difficult to quantify, not least for the players trusted to represent millions of supporters across the globe by donning the colours. For Gary Pallister, a United legend signed in 1989 just five years after playing non-league football with Billingham Town, it did not take long for the enormity of what surrounded him to hit home. “You’re not quite prepared for what Manchester United is when you get there,” said Pallister. “You go on your first trip abroad to somewhere like Asia and you get an understanding of how big the club is. “I didn’t expect in my career to get a call from possibly the biggest club in the world. I got into the game late - at 19 I was still playing non-league football - and I was just pleased to be playing professionally at any kind of level [at Middlesbrough]. “It just spiralled all the way to Manchester United, so it was one of those ‘pinch me’ moments. I couldn’t believe it had happened but I was made up that they put a bid in for me.” To mark the start of Chevrolet’s seven-year Manchester United shirt sponsorship, Pallister joined a host of club legends to shoot a video paying homage to the history of iconic club shirts. The Chevrolet film features United fans throughout history marching through the streets of Manchester with current players and legends singing the ‘Glory, Glory Man Utd’ anthem. Taking part brought back special memories of wearing red at Old Trafford for Pallister – what it meant to him and how much the shirt really matters to fans. “To actually put the jersey on [for the first time] to go out and play was one of those surreal moments,” he said. “There’s a lot of things going through your head - a few years back I’d been playing for Billingham Town, then Middlesbrough, so I was thinking about the journey I’d been on, and there you are putting on this iconic shirt. It sends a bit of a shiver down your spine.” Club history is an important part of the education of any United footballer but Pallister insists he did not dwell on the famous players who had worn the No.6 shirt before him. He took good care of it; years later, in 2011, Jonny Evans shared a conversation he had with Alex Bruce, the Hull player and son of Pallister’s central defensive partner Steve, in which they talked of Evans inheriting ‘Pally’s number’. “The number was personal to me,” said Pallister. “Six was the number I’d always worn at Middlesbrough and I was delighted to be able to wear it at Manchester United. It’s a superstitious thing I guess, but I wasn’t thinking so much about the players of the past. My mind was in the present and focusing on playing in the shirt and trying to prove to the fans that I was worth the money and a place in the Manchester United team.” United introduced a yellow and green away shirt in 1992-93 to celebrate the 100-year anniversary of the first Football League match played by Newton Heath, the club which became Manchester United. In one of those fitting twists of fate, United won their first league championship - the inaugural Premier League title - since 1967. A lot has changed since 1892, but at United, as much as any major club in the country, many things stay the same. An appreciation of where the club has been, from the glory of the European Cup to the relationship with the local community, is non-negotiable. “When you’re around the club you understand [its significance],” said Pallister. “One thing you get taught about straight away is the history and traditions, and what Manchester United means to so many people. You’re aware of that, the history plays a massive part in what Manchester United is all about. It’s part of your schooling.” The new Manchester United shirt, sponsored by Chevrolet, will be unveiled on July 7	sports

Does Costa Rica story have one more chapter? - Goal.com	Costa Rica have provided one of the heartwarming tales of this World Cup but can they rouse themselves again to trouble the Netherlands? By Julian Bennetts The video is called ‘el major dia de mi via’ [the best day of my life] and it would melt the coldest of hearts. It takes in a day of drama in San Jose as Costa Rica stops to watch the national team take on Greece in the quarter-finals of the World Cup. Filmed last Sunday the emotions are familiar to us all; delight at taking the lead, agony at conceding a last-minute equaliser and then utter bedlam as the penalty shoot-out is won. The Costa Rican journalist who is showing everyone the video in the press room at the crumbling Vila Belmira stadium in Santos is emotional, a look of wonder on his face. "I called home after the game, some four hours later, and my father was crying down the phone to me," he says. "I had never heard him cry before." This is new, unchartered territory for Costa Rica, the success story of the World Cup. As Celso Borges, the articulate midfielder, enters the press room he pauses for a second. For his previous press conference there were a dozen journalists and three cameras. Now over 20 lenses are pointed at him and 100 or so pens are poised to note down his every word. The stadium can't take it – the air-conditioning unit begins bleeding water at an alarming rate perilously close to the electrical sound-desk – and there is a fear that the team might not be able to either. Exhausted, struggling with injuries and suspensions, it is likely that Saturday's quarter-final with Netherlands may be a bridge too far. But that can wait. Firstly, it is time to revel in the success that a nation of under five million people has thoroughly enjoyed over the last month. The star is Jorge Luis Pinto, the coach. In his second spell with the national team, he was extremely unpopular a month ago. Central to that was his decision to take striker Marco Urena, who plays for Kuban Krasnodar in Russia, over Deportivo Saprissa forward and local hero Kendall Watson. Urena scored the third goal in the win over Uruguay, and so far every decision Pinto has taken has been justified. He works his players hard, with double training sessions every single day. The government has cottoned on to the mood of the people and offered the Colombian coach Costa Rican citizenship. It is thought unlikely he will accept, and he is not expected to continue in his position after the World Cup. Pinto, whose football education in Germany shines through, is considered likely to take a club job in Mexico or Colombia after the tournament – after all, what else can he achieve with Costa Rica? In his stead will come Luis Marin and Paulo Wanchope, his assistants. Marin is expected to be appointed manager, with Wanchope his second in command, by virtue of the fact he has been in charge of Costa Rica's defence, the most impressive aspect of their team. A key part of that defence is Keylor Navas, the goalkeeper. Linked with Arsenal and Napoli, subscriptions to cable television have rocketed in Costa Rica since he moved to Levante, in Spain. Even more are expected to subscribe if Joel Campbell makes an impression in Arsenal's first-team. Neither of those players have trained this week, struggling as they are with injuries and fatigue. It is a common problem for a country that has a fine first XI but struggles for strength in depth. With Oscar Duarte suspended and Roy Miller injured, Pinto's five-man defence is almost in tatters and there is a fear they will be picked off by the Dutch. "They are all tired but happy in their hearts," is the take of Erick Sanches Alvarado, the fitness coach. To this point Costa Rica have undoubtedly benefited from being underestimated, as well as the conditions playing into their hands. As they train in the Vila Belmira – the former home of Pele and Neymar, with the players taking inspiration from Pele's locker in the dressing room, which remains untouched since his last game for Santos in 1974 – they are professional and well drilled. "We didn't come here to visit Rio, lie on the beach and be tourists," says Borges. "We came here to compete and I really hope we can create memories for the people back home. "I don't know if we are fully understanding what we are doing but I think that [making history] has given us something, and of course we see the pictures and videos of people back home. "Whatever the result is against Holland we can be proud of what we have done. "But the feeling among us now is that the teams we have beaten and the way we have beaten them gives us confidence." Confidence yes, but it may not be enough. Costa Rica have had their moment in the sun, but there is a fear the game against the Dutch may be a bridge too far. Still, what a story, and what a video. Maybe they can pull off one last surprise.	sports

"I don't know if we are fully understanding what we are doing but I think that [making history] has given us something, and of course we see the pictures and videos of people back home. "Whatever the result is against Holland we can be proud of what we have done. "But the feeling among us now is that the teams we have beaten and the way we have beaten them gives us confidence." Confidence yes, but it may not be enough. Costa Rica have had their moment in the sun, but there is a fear the game against the Dutch may be a bridge too far. Still, what a story, and what a video. Maybe they can pull off one last surprise.	sports

Messi the key as Argentina aim for first semi-final since 1990 - Goal.com	COMMENT: The South Americans have failed to reach the last four of a World Cup since the days of Diego Maradona and now need their current star to step up once again By Ben Hayward in Belo Horizonte Argentina are always among the favourites to win the World Cup. Two-time winners, in 1978 and 1986, the Albiceleste are expected to go all the way to the final this time around. But first they have to make it through to the last four - something they haven't achieved since finishing as runners-up in 1990. Back then, Diego Maradona was still in his prime at 29, albeit playing through the pain of a badly swollen ankle. Lionel Messi, meanwhile, was just three years of age. Now, at 27, he is the man making things happen for Argentina - pretty much the only one so far - and his next trick will be to try to propel his nation to a World Cup semi-final for the first time since the Maradona era. Since their back-to-back World Cup finals in 1986 and 1990, Argentina have made it to four quarter-finals (1998, 2006, 2010 and 2014) and lost once in the last 16 (1994). They fell in the group stages in 2002. In their way of a place in the last four this time are Belgium, a team swept aside at the semi-final stage in 1986. Then, it was a vintage display from Maradona which led the South Americans to the final as the skipper struck twice within 12 second-half minutes to settle a difficult duel with a 2-0 win. Happy days | Maradona played in two World Cup finals, winning the trophy in 1986 The first was a fine finish - an opportunistic toe-poke over goalkeeper Jean-Marie Pfaff. The second, however, was wonderful - a mesmerising run past four Belgian defenders and angled shot past Pfaff. It was the type of performance Maradona produced in almost every game as Argentina claimed the title in Mexico. Something similar is happening this time around with Messi. While the team's performances have been off-colour so far at Brazil 2014, the Barcelona forward's fantasy football has saved the day in all four of their games. Messi struck a wonder goal against Bosnia-Herzegovina in Argentina's opening match, which turned out to be the winner in a 2-1 victory, before hitting an arguably even better goal to give Alejandro Sabella's side a last-gasp 1-0 success over Iran and then two more special strikes to help his team beat Nigeria 3-2. Then, in the last 16, it was his run in the dying minutes of extra time which set up Angel Di Maria for the winner against Switzerland. "We have lost fluidity," Maradona said this week. "Unless Messi is attacking, I don't even get out of my chair. It seems to me that Argentina have no idea and we cannot put all the weight on Messi's shoulders." Such things were also said in 1986, however, when a somewhat sterile Argentina side came to life thanks to their talisman, the world's best player at that time. Maradona. For Diego in 1986 read Leo in 2014. Argentina again find themselves with a struggling side, looking to one divine talent to help them achieve their holy grail. But beating Belgium and ending their semi-final hoodoo of recent times is a more urgent priority. And while Argentina may be short of inspiration, Messi most certainly is not.

Georginio Wijnaldum: The wonderboy comes of age at World Cup - Goal.com	COMMENT: The midfielder first burst onto the scene about seven years ago and is finally developing into the player he promised to become upon his debut By Stefan Coerts in Brazil There was a real sense of excitement when Georginio Wijnaldum made his first-team debut for Feyenoord in April 2007 at the tender age of 16. The young midfielder already carried a reputation as one of the biggest prodigies of the Rotterdam side’s youth academy and his performance in that Eredivisie match versus Groningen only further boosted his reputation.  Yet despite making over 130 appearances for Feyenoord before even turning 21, Wijnaldum never really managed to live up to the high expectations at De Kuip.   Even when he netted 14 goals in 34 league games in 2010-11, the attacking midfielder came in for criticism on a regular basis. Many felt Wijnaldum lacked the vision to play in midfield, rued his profligacy in front of goal and his tendency to go for the difficult solution rather than play a simple pass didn’t win him many admirers either.  After leaving Feyenoord for PSV in the summer of 2011, the Rotterdam-native initially continued to divide opinion among fans. His frivolous style of play and intuitive dribbling helped him win over some of his critics, yet his occasionally wasteful play angered plenty of supporters, too.  Things have changed for Wijnaldum in the past two seasons, however.   In 2012-13, the gifted midfielder not only netted an impressive 20 goals in 45 appearances in all competitions, but he also developed from a playful midfielder into a mature player capable of taking his side by the hand on difficult moments.  With key figures such as Kevin Strootman, Mark van Bommel, Dries Mertens and Jeremain Lens all leaving PSV ahead of the 2013-14 campaign, the Eindhoven side were looking toward Wijnaldum as one of the team’s new leaders.  The versatile midfielder did not let the PSV hierarchy down and showed that he was up for the task at hand with a string of fine performances in the opening months of the season, resulting in a call-up for Netherlands’ friendly against Portugal in August, only his third cap at senior level some two years after his debut for Oranje. "Wijnaldum used to play on the right wing, but is playing in midfield now. I really like players like him. He has really surprised me," commented Louis van Gaal on the 23-year-old’s return to the national side.  The midfielder’s hopes of making it to Brazil were dealt a huge blow shortly after his comeback for Holland, however, with a persistent back injury keeping him out of action for the majority of the season. But Wijnaldum eventually returned to full match fitness just in time for Van Gaal to include him in his provisional squad and the PSV star has not looked back since. He quickly convinced the Netherlands boss that he could be of added value in Brazil and made the final squad, too.  Wijnaldum had to settle for a spot on the bench in Oranje’s opening two games versus Spain and Australia, but he proved to be a significant upgrade on Jonathan De Guzman after coming on in both matches and featured from the start against Chile and Mexico.  Key man | Wijnaldum has developed into a mature midfielder in the past two seasons The former Feyenoord starlet is no longer the type of player who catches the eye with his silky dribbles and unpredictable individual actions, but has become a mature midfielder who has plenty to offer both and off the ball. Wijnaldum is always ready to help out his back-four whenever needed, but is also willing to make runs forward without the ball in order to create space for his team-mates or pop up in dangerous positions.  "We all want to do whatever is best for the team. It's irrelevenant how I prefer to play and what I want. It's all about what works for the team. Against Chile, I needed to stay close to my direct opponent and do a lot of defensive work," Wijnaldum stated after the 2-0 win over Chile to underline his more maturity. His ever-increasing status with the national side is a just reward for the impressive development Wijnaldum has gone through in recent years. It might have taken him a bit of time, but the sympathetic midfielder is finally coming of age. And that he is doing so at the World Cup – the biggest stage possible – is only further proof that Wijnaldum has grown up at last. With Nigel de Jong out of action due to injury, the PSV man will only become more important to Holland. His recent development suggests that he is more than ready for that extra responsibility, however.	sports
18 Jharkhand girls to represent India - Goal.com	The NGO's operations and effectiveness has been well documented in furthering girls' educations through football, with the founder hoping for a bright future for all involved... Come Sunday the dreams, hopes and aspirations for a group of 18 teenage girls from the rural and economically backward districts of Jharkhand will bear fruit as they travel to United States to participate in the renowned Schwan's USA Cup hosted in the city of Blaine, Minnesota. They will further create history by being the first Indian team ever to participate in the tournament. Their travels and adventures come as the result of an initiative by NGO Yuwa, who helped them start their training as early as 2009. Yuwa, under their American founder Franz Gastler, has gone from strength to strength. The NGO started in 2009 off as an initiative to prevent the trafficking of girls for domestic work and sexual abuses by empowering them through football. Now, Gastler a political economy post-graduate, is himself is prepping up the girls for the tournament in the USA with the hope that their performances will help them create scope of further education in renowned and established American universities. The girls are expected to showcase their skills between the 11th and 19th of July. The girls, who come from interior villages such as Hutup, Karma, Koilari and Rukka, have trained for the event in paddy fields due to unavailability of a football field. The rigorous schedule that makes up their day includes training sessions at the Yuwa centre in English and computer skills before trudging off to school. They then have training sessions between 4.30 pm and 6.30 pm besides helping their low-earning parents by involving themselves in domestic work which includes cooking, sweeping and other household activities, all to earn that extra shilling. "The girls rate each other on wide ranging parameters like discipline, attendance, performance and leadership qualities including honesty, selflessness, unity and positivity. They a core committee assesses the rankings to arrive at a decision," explains a Yuwa participant, on the selection methods used the Yuwa NGO, to the Times of India.      "Hum apne mann ki baat yahan keh saktey hain. Zaroorat mein ek doosre ka saath de saktey hain. (We can share our thoughts here. We can support each other in times of need)," explained another sapling, who believes football unites the gang of girls under a common umbrella and goal  like no other. However, society with its instilled paradigms on women often takes centre stage and the girls found setbacks no less abetting on arriving back to their hometown after a triumphant tournament in Spain where they finished a laudable third. The owner of the land where they used to hold practice, ploughed it so that it could never be used for training again. Since then, they have been running helter-skelter looking for a suitable training field. In an effort to further their dreams, they approached Gastler who was helping out at a local NGO, who later started Yuwa and was helped in raising scholarships for the girls through the efforts of a few friends. The group has now expanded to about 150 girls, who under Yuwa’s tutelage study, play football and travel to various localities. The aim of the project is to ensure the girls can stand up for themselves. Youth coaches are drawn from the same community who in turn encourage others from different villages to join. "There is no social safety net and no one they can reach out to when in trouble. Girls disappear in large numbers but no one knows. In such circumstances football for these girls is proving to be a unifying factor. Here they share and try and find their own solutions," elucidated Franz.   	sports
Dempo: We need to discuss the business model surrounding the I-League - Goal.com	The chairman of the Goan club backs his side to come good in the 2014-15 season… Although Dempo SC did manage to finish fourth last season, their form was patchy.  For two seasons, the team has failed to win any silverware which is very much unlike Dempo – a club known to fight for trophies. However given the number of changes made to the squad last summer with several young players roped in, it was a decent achievement. Shrinivas Dempo, chairman of the prestigious club believes that they could be one of the serious contenders for the I-League title this time around. “Dempo Sports Club has always given a platform to young and budding talents of the game in Goa. Last year when we decided to reshuffle the team, we had a plan about the future. We wanted to build a team which will brighten our prospects in national and international tournaments in the years to come. “Last year was a testing time for us. Although we had a patchy start to the league, I think we did pretty well at the end. If you see now, we have retained almost entire squad from last year. If the boys continue to play well then I think we are one of the serious contenders for the I-League this season,” he told Goal. Dempo recently has referred to the I-League as the ‘heart and soul of Indian football’ and on being asked if there could be a way to make this a commercially viable model in order to sustain it, he mentioned that is something which needs to be pondered upon. “There is no doubt that I-league is the premier football event in India. Now, to make it commercially viable and sustaining, we have to go back to our basics and consider the views of all stakeholders in the league. This requires adequate brainstorming and could be an ongoing exercise. “But, I think this is the need of the hour as we all need to sit and discuss the business model surrounding I-League,” he said.    	sports

Churchill Brothers SC players swarm to the ISL - Goal.com	With no future for them in the I-League, given that the club is suspended for non-fulfillment of the required licensing criterion, the players sort to secure their future... By Nikhil Jitendran and Anselm Noronha In what is a big blow to Goan club Churchill Brothers' football aspirations, four of their stars have jumped ship to join the Indian Super League (ISL) bandwagon and have agreed professional terms with the ISL's organisers, IMG-Reliance. Denzil Franco, Lenny Rodrigues, Arindam Bhattacharya and Jaison Valles, all of whom were roped into the tournament after mutually agreeing to end their stint with the 2012-13 I-League champions. Although Anthony Barbosa, also a former Churchill Brothers player who received his release from the club in prior to his switch to the ISL, the above mentioned four had to wait for their NOC (non-objection certificate) from the club to join the upcoming league. As per the FIFA regulations, if a player hasn't been paid for over three months, he has every right to terminate the contract with the club, and in special circumstances this can also be two months. It is been understood that the players in question had initially written to the All India Football Federation (AIFF) to get a release from the club. The matter was later amicably resolved by Churchill after the quartet withdrew their complaint to the governing body of football in India. "We thought since Churchill [Brothers] is not going to be there in the I-League, that we would be nowhere and be missing out on many opportunities. So we decided to quit the club," explained Denzil Franco. "We have had good fruitful years with Churchill Brothers. We have nothing against the club," he added. "We didn't know where our fate lies [at Churchill Brothers], so it's time to move on and do something for ourselves. So we signed for IMG-Reliance." Lenny Rodrigues praised Churchill Brothers for showing faith in him and added that it was time to bid adieu to the Goan club. "It was Churchill Brothers who gave me the platform to showcase my talent, so I was always thinking that it would be good if the club remains (in the I-League). But now I have no option as I have to sustain my own future. As you know, we (footballers) have a short career." Also echoeing his thoughts was goalkeeper Arindam Bhattacharya, who said, "We were waiting for quite a few days until we decided to join the ISL (Indian Super League). I spoke to Denzil and Lenny before making my move. "I have only good memories with Churchill Brothers and whatever I have won I have won at this club. I feel really bad that we are leaving, but I have to look after my own family who is in Kolkata. I always wish Churchill Brothers good luck."  How do you stay up with football when on the move?

Brazil hopes fade with Neymar blow - Goal.com	COMMENT: The Barcelona forward suffered a fractured vertebra in the win over Colombia on Friday and his World Cup is over. Without him, the hopes of the Selecao seem slim By Ben Hayward in Belo Horizonte Brazil's worst fears have been confirmed. When Neymar left the pitch against Colombia on a stretcher on Friday following a reckless challenge by Juan Zuniga, a nation held its breath. But just two hours later, team doctor Rodrigo Lasmar told the Brazilian public on live television just what they didn't want to hear: Neymar was out of the World Cup. So forget a rapid return on Tuesday for the semi-final against Germany or a possible recovery in time for the final on July 13th. Neymar has a fractured vertebra and will be sidelined for between four and six weeks. His World Cup is over. And without him, Brazil's campaign may also be finished. "It's a dream [to play in the next round], but we're a bit sad Neymar is out of the competition," David Luiz said after the game. "He's a great guy, a great person and a great player. He brings good things to football. Everyone feels a bit sad because he's like a brother to me. We'll try to win the competition for Brazil. It would be great if we can win and celebrate with him." Earlier, in the post-match press conference, coach Luiz Felipe Scolari had been pessimistic. "Everyone knew that Neymar was going to be hunted," he said. "He was kneed on his lower back and he was crying out in pain and I can guarantee that it won’t be easy for him to recover, based on what the doctor told us and the pain he’s in." However, the Brazil boss claimed his side could cope without the 22-year-old. "If anything has to change, we’ll do that and we’ll play a great game [against Germany]," he explained. That, however, will be easier said than done. Neymar was Brazil's best player by far in the group games, scoring four goals in the wins over Croatia and Cameroon. He also hit home what turned out to be the winning penalty in the shootout against Chile following a 1-1 draw earlier this week. In an efficient and workmanlike side, the 22-year-old was unquestionably the shining star - the man making the difference. But now he is gone - and there is no real replacement within the squad. The one Brazilian player with the 'X-factor' Neymar brings to the table is Ronaldinho, but Scolari gave up on the former Barcelona forward a long time ago. Likewise Kaka. In Neymar's absence, Felipao looks likely to turn to Chelsea's Willian, while Bernard is another alternative and Scolari could also opt for a formation change - although that seems unlikely. Germany are up next in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday and on the evidence of Brazil's previous performances in this tournament, Joachim Low's men have little to be afraid of - especially without Neymar. Brazil remain a strong side, but with their best player out, much of the fear factor will also be missing. Scolari is set to opt for a European-style, high-tempo pressing and passing game, placing his faith in a strong collective more than ever before. But with Thiago Silva suspended against Germany and Neymar now sidelined for the remainder of the competition, Brazil face a tremendous task if they are to win this World Cup. Right now, it looks a little too much to ask. Follow Ben Hayward on	sports

They then have training sessions between 4.30 pm and 6.30 pm besides helping their low-earning parents by involving themselves in domestic work which includes cooking, sweeping and other household activities, all to earn that extra shilling. "The girls rate each other on wide ranging parameters like discipline, attendance, performance and leadership qualities including honesty, selflessness, unity and positivity. They a core committee assesses the rankings to arrive at a decision," explains a Yuwa participant, on the selection methods used the Yuwa NGO, to the Times of India.      "Hum apne mann ki baat yahan keh saktey hain. Zaroorat mein ek doosre ka saath de saktey hain. (We can share our thoughts here. We can support each other in times of need)," explained another sapling, who believes football unites the gang of girls under a common umbrella and goal  like no other. However, society with its instilled paradigms on women often takes centre stage and the girls found setbacks no less abetting on arriving back to their hometown after a triumphant tournament in Spain where they finished a laudable third. The owner of the land where they used to hold practice, ploughed it so that it could never be used for training again. Since then, they have been running helter-skelter looking for a suitable training field. In an effort to further their dreams, they approached Gastler who was helping out at a local NGO, who later started Yuwa and was helped in raising scholarships for the girls through the efforts of a few friends. The group has now expanded to about 150 girls, who under Yuwa’s tutelage study, play football and travel to various localities. The aim of the project is to ensure the girls can stand up for themselves. Youth coaches are drawn from the same community who in turn encourage others from different villages to join. "There is no social safety net and no one they can reach out to when in trouble. Girls disappear in large numbers but no one knows. In such circumstances football for these girls is proving to be a unifying factor. Here they share and try and find their own solutions," elucidated Franz.   	sports
Churchill Brothers SC players swarm to the ISL - Goal.com	With no future for them in the I-League, given that the club is suspended for non-fulfillment of the required licensing criterion, the players sort to secure their future... By Nikhil Jitendran and Anselm Noronha In what is a big blow to Goan club Churchill Brothers' football aspirations, four of their stars have jumped ship to join the Indian Super League (ISL) bandwagon and have agreed professional terms with the ISL's organisers, IMG-Reliance. Denzil Franco, Lenny Rodrigues, Arindam Bhattacharya and Jaison Valles, all of whom were roped into the tournament after mutually agreeing to end their stint with the 2012-13 I-League champions. Although Anthony Barbosa, also a former Churchill Brothers player who received his release from the club in prior to his switch to the ISL, the above mentioned four had to wait for their NOC (non-objection certificate) from the club to join the upcoming league. As per the FIFA regulations, if a player hasn't been paid for over three months, he has every right to terminate the contract with the club, and in special circumstances this can also be two months. It is been understood that the players in question had initially written to the All India Football Federation (AIFF) to get a release from the club. The matter was later amicably resolved by Churchill after the quartet withdrew their complaint to the governing body of football in India. "We thought since Churchill [Brothers] is not going to be there in the I-League, that we would be nowhere and be missing out on many opportunities. So we decided to quit the club," explained Denzil Franco. "We have had good fruitful years with Churchill Brothers. We have nothing against the club," he added. "We didn't know where our fate lies [at Churchill Brothers], so it's time to move on and do something for ourselves. So we signed for IMG-Reliance." Lenny Rodrigues praised Churchill Brothers for showing faith in him and added that it was time to bid adieu to the Goan club. "It was Churchill Brothers who gave me the platform to showcase my talent, so I was always thinking that it would be good if the club remains (in the I-League). But now I have no option as I have to sustain my own future. As you know, we (footballers) have a short career." Also echoeing his thoughts was goalkeeper Arindam Bhattacharya, who said, "We were waiting for quite a few days until we decided to join the ISL (Indian Super League). I spoke to Denzil and Lenny before making my move. "I have only good memories with Churchill Brothers and whatever I have won I have won at this club. I feel really bad that we are leaving, but I have to look after my own family who is in Kolkata. I always wish Churchill Brothers good luck."  How do you stay up with football when on the move?

'No one believed in us' - Scolari buoyant as Brazil reach semi-finals - Goal.com	The 65-year-old hailed his team's effort over the 90 minutes against Colombia, though he admits they could have taken a more reserved approach after scoring their second goal Luiz Felipe Scolari was left delighted with the way his Brazil players took the game to Colombia and advanced to the semi-finals of the World Cup. A battling 2-1 win over Jose Pekerman's side sealed the Selecao's spot in the last four on Friday, where they will face 2002 beaten finalists Germany, who overcame France. Scolari was furious with Brazilian media in the build-up to the last-eight encounter following criticism of his side's displays so far and was thrilled with the way they performed on the night in Fortaleza. "No one believed in us," he told reporters. "These players have skills and do this with a lot of dedication. "We have a tough game ahead of us, but what we have foreseen, Germany was in our path to play in the final – and they know that." Scolari admits his side could have allowed themselves to take their foot off the accelerator when David Luiz struck the second goal of the night, though he says he has come to expect the same high-intensity work-rate from his charges. "I'm going to look at our players and expect them to recover. The rhythm in the second half when we scored and we went 2-0 up and we could have slowed the game down, we accelerated. "We don't need to do that. We don't need a player who stops the ball because he might not run. My team runs a lot. "To slow the game down a bit [is necessary] but you can't forget that for one and a half years we've been working with these players." Brazil got off to a fantastic start when Thiago Silva scored in the first seven minutes following another awe-inspiring rendition of the national anthem, but Scolari says he is not all that surprised to see the Brazil faithful so vociferous in their support. "For many years Brazil has been trying to embed in children that they have to respect their anthem. And when we see how the crowd reacted – the crowd in Fortaleza was excellent again – we have to say that it is important. We should consider our anthem important."	sports

David Luiz 'sad' that 'brother' Neymar is out of World Cup - Goal.com	The Paris Saint-Germain defender has refused to condemn the challenge that has ruled Brazil's star forward out of the rest of the competition David Luiz has admitted he is "sad" that Neymar's injury will cause him to miss the remainder of the World Cup. The forward was challenged late in Brazil's match 2-1 win over Colombia by Juan Camilo Zuniga and suffered a fractured vertebra, meaning he is now expected to be sidelined for an extended period. The Paris Saint-Germain defender does not hold any grudge against the culprit but has admitted he is hurting for a player he described as his "brother". "It's a dream [to play in the next round], but we're a bit sad Neymar is out of the competition," he stated. "He's a great guy, a great person and a great player. He brings good things to football. Everyone feels a bit sad because he's like a brother to me. "Am I Angry? No. I've not seen the video, so I don't know how it happened. "I never crucify players because in life you do things because you don't think, you're emotional. If he wanted to do that, he'll feel sad. If he just tried to stop the game, that's natural, that's football." Brazil are on course for a sixth world title, but if it is achieved, it will be dedicted to a broader cause than just the 22-year-old. "We'll try to win the competition for Brazil!" he said. "It would be great if we can win and we can celebrate with him." It was Luiz's superb free kick that proved the difference over the Colombians, and he joked that it was down to his "genetics". The centre-back struck an unstoppable shot in the 69th minute to give Brazil a 2-0 lead in their World Cup quarter-final in Fortaleza and it turned out to be the decisive goal as Colombia's James Rodriguez reduced the deficit from the penalty spot late in the game. It was only his second goal for Brazil, with the first coming in the 1-1 draw against Chile in the sides' last-16 tie earlier this week, which was settled on penalties. Then, Chile's Gonzalo Jara looked to have got the final touch, but there was absolutely no doubt about this one as the Paris Saint-Germain defender blasted a fierce effort into the right-hand corner from 34 yards out. "I think it's my genetics," he said after claiming the Man of the Match award. "I was born with legs like these. Today was great because I hit the ball at the perfect point. I'm happy I can help my team like this." Brazil's win sets up a semi-final clash with Germany on Tuesday and Luiz is full of respect for Joachim Low's side. "They are a great team with a great coach and a great philosophy to play football," he said. "It will be a great game." In that match, however, Luiz will be without central defensive partner Thiago Silva, who picked up a yellow card on Friday and will be suspended against Germany. "The other two [Dante and Henrique] who can play are also great players," Luiz said. "They are dreaming of playing in a World Cup. We'll miss our captain, but we will be well served. God touched this man beside me - and he knows how to find the best players."	sports
Colombia made a statement at World Cup, says Pekerman - Goal.com	The 64-year-old coach is proud of his team’s showing in Brazil, insisting they are once again prominent on the world stage after a 16-year absence from the tournament Jose Pekerman believes Colombia made a statement at the World Cup despite seeing their dreams dashed by hosts Brazil in the quarter-finals. Los Cafeteros reached the last eight of the competition in their first appearance at the finals since 1998 following some impressive performances against the likes of Japan and Uruguay. Their campaign in Brazil was brought to an end by the host nation following goals from Thiago Silva and David Luiz in a 2-1 win, but Pekerman was nothing less than delighted by their showing during the tournament. "In regards to everything we did during the World Cup, after being absent for a long time, this team went a long way to reassess football in Colombia," Pekerman told reporters. "We showed we have very talented players and we always competed with a significant spirit and we showed we came to play a wonderful World Cup and not just participate." Despite his high spirits, the Argentinian was still raw over the defeat, which came about following a thoroughly-competitive clash in which Brazil committed 31 of the total of 54 fouls. "This was a match in which we were going to have balance, and when you have good players on both sides, what happens is you create friction because of the competitiveness. Each player wants to win their duels. "It's not easy to lead such a game, the tension was very high. Brazil needed the win, we aspired to the victory, and in every play there was a lot of intensity. That interrupted the game. "These are two teams that can develop very good football, but this balance sometimes produces that sort of thing. "The first goal is always key and Brazil calmed down and were able to create better moments. Colombia lost that sense of play... we were surprised by the [opening] goal." James Rodriguez struck his sixth goal of the competition in the clash, moving him two clear of Neymar and Lionel Messi in the race for the Golden Boot. The Monaco midfielder has enjoyed a sensational tournament and has reportedly attracted interest from some of the best teams in the world, and Pekerman believes this is just the start of what is to come for the 22-year-old. "The work of James during this World Cup has been excellent and for a long time we have expected this of him. He's an outstanding player and a huge talent - and he has ambitions," added Pekerman. "He dreams of being able to continue to show what he can do - and also the team, which backed him. I tried to calm him down because personally he deserves a huge congratulations. "He is to be commended because we enjoy the way he plays and I have no doubt that he will show in future he can be one of the best."	sports
Neymar out of the World Cup - Goal.com	The Barcelona forward was carried off in pain in the latter stages of his side's win over Colombia and will miss the rest of the tournament By Robin Bairner in Fortaleza Brazil forward Neymar has been ruled out of the remainder of the World Cup after suffering a broken vertebra in his side's win over Colombia. Team doctor Rodrigo Lasmar confirmed the news to Brazilian TV after the Barcelona star underwent further tests in a Fortaleza hospital. Lasmar said: "It's not easy news to give but the truth is he won't be available for the rest of the World Cup. "The tests showed a fracture near the third vertebra. It won't need surgery but he needs to be immobilised to control the pain. He cannot play, a week will not be enough. "He needs cautious treatment, with a belt around his back so he'll feel more comfortable. It is also required for him to heal the fracture." The news realises the worst fears of coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, who will be without both his star attacker and best defender against Germany in the semi-finals on Tuesday with captain Thiago Silva suspended. Neymar was caught from behind by a reckless Juan Zuniga challenge and had to be carried off on a stretcher towards the end of the Selecao's 2-1 victory. Scolari was pessimistic after the match. He said: "Neymar went to the clinic here in the stadium. He was kneed on his lower back and he was crying out in pain and I can guarantee that it won’t be easy for him to recover, based on what the doctor told us and the pain he’s in. And as it’s lower back, I don’t know." Scolari bore no grudges against Zuniga and insisted Brazil would move forward with confidence even without their talisman. He added: "Everyone knows that Neymar was going to be hunted. We knew this was the case.  "I don't think the foul was on purpose, I think he came in to stop the ball. There's no point in thinking about it, the game is over.  "If anything has to change, we’ll do that and we’ll play a great game." Zuniga insisted there was no malice in the challenge. He said: "I never meant to hurt the player, I was just defending the shirt." Neymar is the darling of the Selecao fans who must now be wondering where the goals are going to come from as the tournament enters its business end. The former Santos star has scored four goals in five games at this World Cup and has carried the hopes of a nation on his young shoulders. 	sports

Messi the key as Argentina aim for first semi-final since 1990 - Goal.com	COMMENT: The South Americans have failed to reach the last four of a World Cup since the days of Diego Maradona and now need their current star to step up once again By Ben Hayward in Belo Horizonte Argentina are always among the favourites to win the World Cup. Two-time winners, in 1978 and 1986, the Albiceleste are expected to go all the way to the final this time around. But first they have to make it through to the last four - something they haven't achieved since finishing as runners-up in 1990. Back then, Diego Maradona was still in his prime at 29, albeit playing through the pain of a badly swollen ankle. Lionel Messi, meanwhile, was just three years of age. Now, at 27, he is the man making things happen for Argentina - pretty much the only one so far - and his next trick will be to try to propel his nation to a World Cup semi-final for the first time since the Maradona era. Since their back-to-back World Cup finals in 1986 and 1990, Argentina have made it to four quarter-finals (1998, 2006, 2010 and 2014) and lost once in the last 16 (1994). They fell in the group stages in 2002. In their way of a place in the last four this time are Belgium, a team swept aside at the semi-final stage in 1986. Then, it was a vintage display from Maradona which led the South Americans to the final as the skipper struck twice within 12 second-half minutes to settle a difficult duel with a 2-0 win. Happy days | Maradona played in two World Cup finals, winning the trophy in 1986 The first was a fine finish - an opportunistic toe-poke over goalkeeper Jean-Marie Pfaff. The second, however, was wonderful - a mesmerising run past four Belgian defenders and angled shot past Pfaff. It was the type of performance Maradona produced in almost every game as Argentina claimed the title in Mexico. Something similar is happening this time around with Messi. While the team's performances have been off-colour so far at Brazil 2014, the Barcelona forward's fantasy football has saved the day in all four of their games. Messi struck a wonder goal against Bosnia-Herzegovina in Argentina's opening match, which turned out to be the winner in a 2-1 victory, before hitting an arguably even better goal to give Alejandro Sabella's side a last-gasp 1-0 success over Iran and then two more special strikes to help his team beat Nigeria 3-2. Then, in the last 16, it was his run in the dying minutes of extra time which set up Angel Di Maria for the winner against Switzerland. "We have lost fluidity," Maradona said this week. "Unless Messi is attacking, I don't even get out of my chair. It seems to me that Argentina have no idea and we cannot put all the weight on Messi's shoulders." Such things were also said in 1986, however, when a somewhat sterile Argentina side came to life thanks to their talisman, the world's best player at that time. Maradona. For Diego in 1986 read Leo in 2014. Argentina again find themselves with a struggling side, looking to one divine talent to help them achieve their holy grail. But beating Belgium and ending their semi-final hoodoo of recent times is a more urgent priority. And while Argentina may be short of inspiration, Messi most certainly is not.

Maicon thanks Scolari for starting him over Dani Alves - Goal.com	The 32-year-old right-back was brought into the Brazil side and played 90 minutes in Friday's 2-1 victory over Colombia in the World Cup quarter-final Brazil defender Maicon has thanked coach Luiz Felipe Scolari for selecting him ahead of Dani Alves for Friday’s World Cup quarter-final victory over Colombia in Fortaleza. The 32-year-old was a surprise starter but played the full 90 minutes in the 2-1 win and will now be in line to start in the semi-final clash against Germany in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday. "The coach trusted my work, gave me this opportunity and I hope I paid it back. But the priority here was to make it to the next round and I'm glad we did," Maicon told Fox Sports. "It's kind of complicated, but when it comes to the national team, there's never a guaranteed spot. "We'll wait for coach to make the decision – he will know which of us is the best option for the team on Tuesday."

The 32-year-old was a surprise starter but played the full 90 minutes in the 2-1 win and will now be in line to start in the semi-final clash against Germany in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday. "The coach trusted my work, gave me this opportunity and I hope I paid it back. But the priority here was to make it to the next round and I'm glad we did," Maicon told Fox Sports. "It's kind of complicated, but when it comes to the national team, there's never a guaranteed spot. "We'll wait for coach to make the decision – he will know which of us is the best option for the team on Tuesday." Goals from Thiago Silva and David Luiz were enough to send the Selecao into the last four, although the captain will be banned from the clash with Germany after picking up a booking while there are concerns over Neymar, who had to be stretchered off.	sports
Brazil snap - Goal.com	COMMENT: Maligned in the domestic media, the on-field leader of the Selecao responded in decisive fashion By Robin Bairner in Fortaleza Prior to Brazil’s group match with Mexico, Thiago Silva proclaimed that this was not “a World Cup for defenders”. Over the course of the last few hours, the captain of the Selecao has been proven wrong, most notably as his side overcame Colombia 2-1 to progress to the semi-finals. After Mats Hummels headed Germany past France, the Paris Saint-Germain defender took fewer than 10 minutes to scrappily turn home at the back post following a corner, with marker Carlos Sanchez left staring. It was the first time a Brazil captain had scored at the World Cup finals since Rai found the net in 1994 against Russia. Rai was replaced as skipper in that competition by Dunga and there will be someone else wearing the armband on Tuesday against Germany after Silva collected a needless yellow card and a suspension in Fortaleza. The absence of their captain represents a huge loss to the hosts, though the performance of David Luiz, including a breathtaking second goal via a free-kick, was encouraging.  Silva was the rock from which the home side built their challenge, re-asserting himself as the premier player in the world in the centre-back position after a difficult week that saw his leadership qualities questioned in the domestic press following his tears in the penalty shootout win over Chile. Speaking on Thursday, the 29-year-old stated: “I don’t need to worry about what people say. This is just the way I am. It’s a natural thing for humans to be emotional. People are saying some silly things and that could make it more difficult. But it helps me.” Certainly, the performance produced by the defender at Fortaleza’s Estadio Castelao was every inch that of a leader. Silva, of course, would not habitually expect to contribute offensively, yet he was alert to open the scoring in the early stages and then built on this by demonstrating his wonderful defensive qualities. The pick of these is arguably his reading of the game, and after a stunning burst from James Rodriguez had left Brazil exposed to a three-on-one counter, Silva was astute enough with his angles to cover any easy pass. The Colombians’ most dangerous moment – aside from the late penalty the Monaco playmaker converted – had passed. That Julio Cesar went until almost the 40th minute without a meaningful touch of the ball owed much to the defence, in which Silva played a starring role with a couple of excellent blocks. Even with David Luiz prone to making the odd eye-catching burst forward, the Selecao never looked under any meaningful threat. The effort was not solely down to Silva. In midfield, the contributions of Paulinho and Fernandinho were far above the level that either has previously attained during the tournament, and their contribution behind the offensive players was another vital stone for Luiz Felipe Scolari’s side. With the ball they were sharp and incisive, while robust enough to keep James from having a defining influence on the game. Even the attack did not look quite as Neymar-dependent as it has been at times during the competition. Hulk, effectively playing on home turf as a native of Brazil’s north east, was particularly bullish with his play while even Fred contributed meaningfully with a number of promising lay-offs. Neymar was restricted to a handful of dangerous bursts and went off with a concerning injury late on, while Oscar was limited in his contribution offensively. Indeed, it was the defence and not Neymar that saw Brazil through their toughest challenge of the competition, and keeps them on track for the Hexa. Follow Robin Bairner on 	sports

Word on the Tweet: Ozil, Podolski & Gisele celebrate as Germany & Brazil march into semi-finals - Goal.com	Much of the Joachim Low's squad took to social media after their 1-0 win over France to voice their delight, while England players enjoyed their holidays before pre-season The first two quarter-finals are over and we have our first semi-final as the World Cup sambas towards its conclusion in nine days' time. A below-par France were outdone by a Mats Hummels header while hosts Brazil continued their march to the final with a hard-fought 2-1 win over Colombia. The Germany squad were out in force after the win - take note of Thomas Muller in particular - while supermodel Gisele wore her Selecao colours proudly. And, of course, no WOTT would be complete without Rihanna's latest thoughts on the tournament. Elsewhere, some of England's contingent are making the most of their time off before pre-season by going to Los Angeles or TGI Friday's. Whatever takes your fancy, I guess... 'WE DID IT!'...

Joachim Low delighted with Germany's tactical strength - Goal.com	They may not have been at their best against France but the 54-year-old was pleased with how his players adapted to an altered line-up Germany boss Joachim Low believes his side’s tactical flexibility will be an advantage heading into the World Cup semi-finals – although he maintains the South American teams should be considered tournament favourites due to the conditions. Germany eased into the last four with a 1-0 defeat of France in Rio on Friday with Low opting to shuffle his pack to include centre-forward Miroslav Klose and shift captain Philipp Lahm to his more accustomed full-back slot. It was hard to gauge the impact of the changes in a tight game which was settled by Mats Hummels' early header, but Low was pleased to have options at his disposal. He said: "Both teams showed a great performance on the defensive side. There were not lots of goalscoring opportunities. We were always trying to push the opponents, always stepping on their toes and we were able to control the danger posed by [Karim] Benzema. "When we analysed France we knew they had two big central defenders and with [Yohan] Cabaye and [Paul] Pogba in midfield we knew it was difficult to go through the middle so I decided to use the sides. That's why I played Lahm down the wings. "The players are always informed of what I have in mind and there are conversations with them. It is no surprise for them, we have played this way before. "This is one of our tactical strengths in that we can play different ways. Against Algeria it was one specific formation, today it was another with Klose in attack and trying to keep the two full-backs busy. France have many players through the middle so we had to play wide and Lahm is very good at that." Playing Lahm at right-back meant Jerome Boateng moved into the centre at the expense of Per Mertesacker. In explaining the decision, Low said: "To use Boateng and Hummels was for tactical reasons as I have seen [Mathieu] Valbuena and [Antoine] Griezmann play and they will always have great speed going forward. I thought Jerome and Mats could solve that problem. "I spoke with Per last night and he showed a terrific reaction." The win means Germany have now qualified for the semi-finals at the last four World Cups but Low believes the conditions hand the South American teams an edge. He added: "I think the Latin American teams have a home advantage, you can't deny that. In 2006 in Germany we had three or four semi-finalists from Europe. Now the South Americans are fighting for their lives. They know the climate and they have an advantage being on their home turf. "It is not easy for us Europeans with 1pm kick-offs. It was extremely hot, you can hardly breathe. It is difficult to try to keep control of the match, to maintain the level of concentration and then you make mistakes. The next match will be at 5pm and the sun will be lower." Although Hummels was named Man of the Match, Germany were still indebted to goalkeeper Manuel Neuer for some vital saves, particulary during the closing minutes, and Low believes the Bayern Munich man is among the best in the world. "The confidence in Manuel Neuer does not just come from me or the staff, he has the confidence of the whole team. It's a really great feeling for the defenders knowing he is very good in the box and good outside the box. He is a great football player, you can pass balls to him like a defender," he added. "Since 2010 he has possibly been the best in the world, he is so cool and calm and this gives the other players confidence."	sports

Brazil 2 - 1 Colombia Match report - Goal.com	The defender lashed home a stunning free kick after Thiago Silva's early goal, with James Rodriguez scoring a penalty before the Barcelona star was forced off in the dying minutes A wonderstrike from David Luiz helped Brazil to a 2-1 World Cup quarter-final win over Colombia - but star forward Neymar was stretchered off in the closing minutes. Tipped by some to exit against a side who have been the talk of the tournament, Luiz Felipe Scolari's men progressed thanks to goals from Thiago Silva and his defensive partner in Fortaleza, the latter a superb 30-yard free kick. Man-of-the-moment James Rodriguez pulled one back from the spot for Colombia in the 80th minute, yet Brazil held on to book a semi-final meeting with Germany. However, Brazil will head into the last four with a series of worries, most notably the suspension of Silva and an injury to star man Neymar. Silva picked up a needless yellow card in the second period, while Neymar was carried off on a stretcher late on to put a dark cloud over Brazil's win. The duo's potential absences, combined with another workmanlike showing, will do little to dispel claims from the likes of Diego Maradona that Brazil are not good enough to win the tournament. Much had been made of Brazil's perceived mental frailties ahead of the match, with players coming under fire for crying during renditions of the national anthem and Scolari's decision to call in a sports psychologist grabbing headlines. Despite such scrutiny, the hosts made a flying start to surge ahead after seven minutes. Silva was the hero, silencing his critics by sneaking behind Carlos Sanchez and kneeing home at the back post from close range after Colombia fatally failed to clear Neymar's corner. Behind for the first time in the competition, Colombia found an immediate response as Juan Cuadrado's effort was deflected just wide. Yet it was still Brazil looking the more purposeful, Hulk twice forcing good stops from David Ospina. Colombia wasted a James-led four-on-two counterattack in between those saves, with the game's end-to-end nature making for a thrilling spectacle. The second period did not assume the same pace, Jose Pekerman's side failing to find the fluency that has been their calling card. Indeed, the biggest moment of those exchanges came when Silva collided with Ospina as the Colombia shot-stopper attempted to kick from his hands, the subsequent yellow card ruling him out of the next phase. With chances few and far between, it took a moment of brilliance from Luiz to leave Brazil on the brink of the last four after 69 minutes. James, so often Colombia's star, crucially brought down Hulk 30 yards from goal, paving the way for Luiz to send a stunning strike beyond Ospina. But just when it seemed a nation could calm down, there was a twist in the tail when Julio Cesar felled Carlos Bacca in the area. The goalkeeper was fortunate not to be shown a red, although that had little impact on tournament top-scorer James - who continued his record of scoring in every game when he coolly sent Cesar the wrong way. As if the tension was not palpable enough, many in attendance were left with heads in hands late on as Neymar was taken from the field after being caught by Zuniga in the dying minutes. Brazil defended defiantly during injury time to seal their semi-final spot against Germany and continue their quest for a sixth world title.	sports

Griezmann: France exit the biggest disappointment of my career - Goal.com	The 23-year-old was devastated after France's defeat to Germany in the World Cup quarter-final while Mathieu Valbuena admitted his side were not efficient enough Antoine Griezmann admits France's quarter-final defeat at the hands of Germany is the toughest moment of his career to date. The Real Sociedad winger was a frustrated figure in attack for Didier Deschamps' side as Mats Hummels' first-half goal proved to be enough to condemn les Bleus to a World Cup exit. And Griezmann, who was visibly devastated after the final whistle, concedes the loss is the most difficult he has had to contend with. "This is the biggest disappointment of my career," he told RTL.   "I was proud to be here, it was dream but we have a Euro (European Championship) to prepare. "I was told not to cry and to keep my head up high. Now it's time for vacation and rest." Mathieu Valbuena shared in his team-mate's disappointment and admits the more efficient and experienced side earned their victory on the day. "It's a shame because we did some wonderful things," he told TF1. "[Germany] have acquired a taste for victory. We lacked efficiency, and they had success. It's difficult to accept that it is over. "We wanted to go through, so we are disappointed. We gave our all, but it was not enough."	sports
Thiago Silva banned from World Cup semi-final clash - Goal.com	The defender picked up a yellow card for a block on Colombia keeper David Ospina, ruling him out of the last four tie with Germany Thiago Silva will miss the World Cup semi-final against Germany after picking up a booking in the 2-1 win against Colombia. The  Brazil captain was shown a yellow card for a needless foul on David Ospina in the 64th minute, his second of the tournament which means he will be suspended for Tuesday's clash in Belo Horizonte. Silva charged towards the goalkeeper, who had just collected a Neymar free-kick, and blocked him as he attempted to clear the ball from danger. "The yellow card has taken me out of the semi-final, but I know whoever comes into my place is well equipped to fill my boots," Silva said. "It was a silly thing. I was running back and he put the ball in front of me - there wasn't really much else I could have done." Dante is likely to come in as Silva's replacement in central defence, with the Bayern Munich defender the most experienced option off the bench. Napoli's Henrique is another option for Luiz Felipe Scolari, but with just five international caps he is likely to be considered too much of a risk against Germany.	sports

Germany are playing well enough to win the World Cup, insists Hummels - Goal.com	The defender, who was named Man of the Match in the 1-0 win over France, says his side's defensive strength gives them a great chance for glory in Brazil Mats Hummels insists Germany are playing well enough to win the World Cup following their narrow quarter-final win over France. Germany have yet to lose a match in Brazil, winning four of their five games to date, including the 1-0 victory on Friday in which Hummels scored the only goal. Joachim Low's side, despite criticism over their standards at time during the tournament, have now reached their fourth consecutive World Cup semi-final, and Hummels maintains their solid approach to matches could see them go all the way in the tournament. "We are playing the kind of football that will give us the chance to win," he told ARD.  "Our defensive strength is what people were expecting. "You can't always score two more goals than the opponents in the World Cup." Hummels scored the only goal in the first half, heading in a Toni Kroos free kick to settle what proved to be a closely-contested encounter. "The ball from Toni Kroos was good and I was in the right place at the right time," he added. "We had moments when we could play nicely but we had to fight. "We knew France are among the top teams, it was not a walk in the park. It was not a pretty match but I think we deserved to go on and if we can carry this on it could pan out even if the next match is difficult. "We have the passion and it should be intensified in the coming games." This was Germany's first match at the Maracana this summer but, with the final set to be played in Rio de Janeiro on July 13, the Borussia Dortmund defender is hoping to be back in a short period of time. "It is a dream to come true for me. I hope it is not over yet and that we will be here again in a couple of days."	sports

Thiago Silva banned from World Cup semi-final clash - Goal.com	The defender picked up a yellow card for a block on Colombia keeper David Ospina, ruling him out of the last four tie with Germany Thiago Silva will miss the World Cup semi-final against Germany after picking up a booking in the 2-1 win against Colombia. The  Brazil captain was shown a yellow card for a needless foul on David Ospina in the 64th minute, his second of the tournament which means he will be suspended for Tuesday's clash in Belo Horizonte. Silva charged towards the goalkeeper, who had just collected a Neymar free-kick, and blocked him as he attempted to clear the ball from danger. "The yellow card has taken me out of the semi-final, but I know whoever comes into my place is well equipped to fill my boots," Silva said. "It was a silly thing. I was running back and he put the ball in front of me - there wasn't really much else I could have done." Dante is likely to come in as Silva's replacement in central defence, with the Bayern Munich defender the most experienced option off the bench. Napoli's Henrique is another option for Luiz Felipe Scolari, but with just five international caps he is likely to be considered too much of a risk against Germany.	sports

Brazil 2 - 1 Colombia Match report - Goal.com	The defender lashed home a stunning free kick after Thiago Silva's early goal, with James Rodriguez scoring a penalty before the Barcelona star was forced off in the dying minutes A wonderstrike from David Luiz helped Brazil to a 2-1 World Cup quarter-final win over Colombia - but star forward Neymar was stretchered off in the closing minutes. Tipped by some to exit against a side who have been the talk of the tournament, Luiz Felipe Scolari's men progressed thanks to goals from Thiago Silva and his defensive partner in Fortaleza, the latter a superb 30-yard free kick. Man-of-the-moment James Rodriguez pulled one back from the spot for Colombia in the 80th minute, yet Brazil held on to book a semi-final meeting with Germany. However, Brazil will head into the last four with a series of worries, most notably the suspension of Silva and an injury to star man Neymar. Silva picked up a needless yellow card in the second period, while Neymar was carried off on a stretcher late on to put a dark cloud over Brazil's win. The duo's potential absences, combined with another workmanlike showing, will do little to dispel claims from the likes of Diego Maradona that Brazil are not good enough to win the tournament. Much had been made of Brazil's perceived mental frailties ahead of the match, with players coming under fire for crying during renditions of the national anthem and Scolari's decision to call in a sports psychologist grabbing headlines. Despite such scrutiny, the hosts made a flying start to surge ahead after seven minutes. Silva was the hero, silencing his critics by sneaking behind Carlos Sanchez and kneeing home at the back post from close range after Colombia fatally failed to clear Neymar's corner. Behind for the first time in the competition, Colombia found an immediate response as Juan Cuadrado's effort was deflected just wide. Yet it was still Brazil looking the more purposeful, Hulk twice forcing good stops from David Ospina. Colombia wasted a James-led four-on-two counterattack in between those saves, with the game's end-to-end nature making for a thrilling spectacle. The second period did not assume the same pace, Jose Pekerman's side failing to find the fluency that has been their calling card. Indeed, the biggest moment of those exchanges came when Silva collided with Ospina as the Colombia shot-stopper attempted to kick from his hands, the subsequent yellow card ruling him out of the next phase. With chances few and far between, it took a moment of brilliance from Luiz to leave Brazil on the brink of the last four after 69 minutes. James, so often Colombia's star, crucially brought down Hulk 30 yards from goal, paving the way for Luiz to send a stunning strike beyond Ospina. But just when it seemed a nation could calm down, there was a twist in the tail when Julio Cesar felled Carlos Bacca in the area. The goalkeeper was fortunate not to be shown a red, although that had little impact on tournament top-scorer James - who continued his record of scoring in every game when he coolly sent Cesar the wrong way. As if the tension was not palpable enough, many in attendance were left with heads in hands late on as Neymar was taken from the field after being caught by Zuniga in the dying minutes. Brazil defended defiantly during injury time to seal their semi-final spot against Germany and continue their quest for a sixth world title.	sports
France 0 - 1 Germany Match report - Goal.com	The centre-back scored his second goal of the tournament to send Joachim Low's men into the last four A first half header from Mats Hummels fired Germany into the semi-finals of the World Cup with a narrow 1-0 win over France. The Borussia Dortmund defender missed the last-16 victory over Algeria as a result of flu-like symptoms, with the bug having also affected a number of the squad in the build-up to Friday's game. Hummels, however, showed now ill-effects of any sickness in the 12th minute, rising highest to head home Toni Kroos' free-kick from the left and hand Germany victory at the Maracana. Such consistent performers throughout World Cup history with seven final appearances, Germany once again showed their ability to grind out results in major tournaments as they successfully stifled France, though Karim Benzema came close to a leveller late on, only to be denied by Manuel Neuer. For Didier Deschamps' men, a competition that had promised so much after the group-stage thumpings of Honduras and Switzerland ended in disappointment, as France failed to gain revenge for semi-final defeats to West Germany at the 1982 and 1986 editions. Germany made the better start, but it was France who had the first effort on goal in the seventh minute when Benzema volleyed Mathieu Valbuena's chipped pass narrowly wide. Hummels made France pay for that miss five minutes later when he broke the deadlock with his second goal of the 2014 World Cup. The defender beat Raphael Varane to Kroos' set-piece and sent a glancing header in off the underside of the crossbar. Twice Germany had appeals for penalties waved away, claiming fouls by Mathieu Debuchy on Miroslav Klose and Thomas Muller, but on each occasion referee Nestor Pitana signalled for play to continue. Neuer was finally called into action for the first time 11 minutes before the break, and reacted brilliantly to keep out Valbuena's left-footed volley, before Hummels deflected Benzema's rebound over the bar. The striker continued to threaten as half-time approached, seeing his header blocked by the body of Hummels and then firing a strike straight at Neuer after cutting in from the left shortly afterwards. France cautiously pressed for an equaliser after the break, but Varane's header from Valbuena's right-wing cross on the hour-mark was comfortable for the goalkeeper. Muller almost put the result beyond doubt nine minutes later, but his shot from an angle was deflected narrowly wide by Mamadou Sakho, although the officials failed to spot the deviation and awarded a goal-kick. Andre Schurrle replaced Klose - who is still in search of the goal that will see him become the World Cup's all-time leading scorer outright - and tested Hugo Lloris with a low drive that the Tottenham man was equal to. Benzema worked some space inside the area with 14 minutes to play, but once again Hummels was there to block and Neuer parried away Blaise Matuidi's effort from a tight angle. With France forced to push men forward, they left themselves vulnerable on the break and Lloris saved well from Schurrle, who ought to have done better eight minutes from time. Neuer then palmed away Benzema's angled drive late on as Germany held on to seal yet another semi-final berth and send France crashing out.	sports

Argentina v Belgium Match preview - Goal.com	Alejandro Sabella's side scraped through their last-16 clash against Switzerland and must improve to beat a Belgium team that also needed extra-time to reach the last-eight Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella will have breathed a sigh of relief after Angel Di Maria's late goal against Switzerland prevented the game from going to penalties, but another tough test on the way to their first World Cup title since 1986 awaits on Saturday in Brasilia against Belgium. Sabella will have to make do without the services of left-back Marcos Rojo against the Europeans after the defender picked up his second yellow card of the tournament in the round of 16, with Jose Basanta expected to take his place. Furthermore, Sergio Aguero remains unavailable due to injury, even though the Manchester City man returned to the training ground earlier this week for some light exercises ahead of a potential return in an eventual semi-final. Aguero’s continued absence means that one of Ezequiel Lavezzi and Maxi Rodriguez is likely to start again versus Belgium, with the former seemingly sitting in pole position to get the nod. Belgium boss Marc Wilmots, meanwhile, received some encouraging news from the treatment table concerning the fitness of Thomas Vermaelen, with the Arsenal man ready to make his comeback. Vermaelen’s return could see either Jan Vertonghen or Daniel Van Buyten drop to the bench, although Wilmots could very well stick with the team that impressed against USA in the round of 16. Tottenham star Mousa Dembele is doubtful for Saturday’s game due to a thigh injury and Axel Witsel and Marouane Fellaini are consequently expected to continue their partnership in midfield. In attack, Wilmots will have to make a choice between Romelu Lukaku and Divock Origi as his starting striker, with the Chelsea man likely to return to the starting XI after his impressive performance off the bench against the USA.	sports

Netherlands v Costa Rica Match preview - Goal.com	Oranje have a selection dilemma as they consider a replacement for the injured midfielder while the Central Americans have slight concerns over their star keeper and Rory Miller Netherlands are reeling from the loss of Nigel de Jong while Costa Rica are sweating on the fitness of Keylor Navas and Roy Miller ahead of Saturday's World Cup quarter-final clash in Salvador. De Jong was forced off just nine minutes into his country's 2-1 last-16 win over Mexico and subsequent scans revealed a groin muscle tear, ruling him out of the remainder of the tournament. Consequently, Louis van Gaal has a tactical dilemma. He could switch to 4-3-3 or continue with the double pivot in front of the five-man defence with which he has started every game, replacing De Jong with Jonathan de Guzman, Jordy Clasie or versatile defender Daley Blind, who moved into midfield against Mexico. If the latter option is taken, Bruno Martins Indi would be the obvious man to step in on the left-hand side of the defence, as he did in Fortaleza. Regardless, Daryl Janmaat is expected to return on the opposite flank in place of Paul Verhaegh, who did not impress against Mexico. As for Costa Rica, goalkeeper Navas, who has been one of the stars of the tournament, missed training on Wednesday because of a minor shoulder problem, but is expected to start. Meanwhile, versatile defender Miller is doubtful because of a muscle tear in his left foot, which is a major concern given centre-half Oscar Duarte is suspended for the last-eight meeting with the Dutch. Elsewhere, coach Jorge Luis Pinto is not expected to make any changes to the side that has served him so well in Brazil, meaning lone striker Joel Campbell will once again be supported by Bryan Ruiz and Christian Bolanos from out wide.	sports

The Stunted Gossip | Football Transfer Rumours and Gossip | Football365	City to bid (an insufficient amount) for Barkley, Liverpool interested in Yedlin, Cole off to Roma and more besides... Last Updated: 05/07/14 at 10:42 Post Comment Latest Articles Arsenal are targeting Casillas and Casilla, Real and Monaco aren't far from James agreement, Evra could still quit Manchester United... Man United offered Angel Di Maria for £40m, Arsenal to spend £35m on Sanchez/Debuchy and Lovren on strike... CITY IN FOR BARKLEY It's been a while since Manchester City hampered the progress of an England international by snapping them up for an extortionate fee, so it is with an air of resignation that we bring you news of the Daily Mirror's claim that the club will make an offer to bring Ross Barkley to the Etihad. With a summer clearout likely to include Joleon Lescott, Gareth Barry and Scott Sinclair leaving the club, City need to markedly increase the number of home grown players at their disposal, and adding Barkley to their ranks would therefore seem a logical move. The Mirror report that City could make a bid of £25million, with former Evertonian Jack Rodwell thrown in for good measure. Given that Roberto Martinez laughed off a reported £38m offer from Liverpool, claiming that even a world record bid would not tempt him to sell, we suspect that City may have to be a little more loose with their cash. LIVERPOOL FANCY MEDDLIN' WITH YEDLIN Another classic World Cup transfer rumour. DeAndre Yedlin did indeed play brilliantly when he came off the bench for USA against Belgium in the last-16, leading most sages to wonder how long it would take before rumoured interest from England was generated. Hands up who had the Metro and Liverpool? There is surely still a concern that Yedlin is impressive going forward but not as strong defensively, but when you have had Glen Johnson in your first team for four years, perhaps that fails to register as a problem. The Metro claim that Liverpool have been scouting Yedlin since the U20 World Cup in Turkey, and would aim to bring him in on an initial trial basis before making the deal permanent later in the transfer window. Hmmm. COLE OFF TO ROMA One full-back that we can't quite believe Liverpool aren't interested in recruiting is Ashley Cole, released by Chelsea at the end of last season, and the Daily Mail claim that the England defender is heading to Italy for talks with Roma. The 33-year-old is likely to be offered a two-year deal, and would presumably fit in very nicely indeed in Serie A. It is one of those slightly naughty Mail rumour stories where the entire article is eight lines long and it also mentions MLS clubs, Monaco, Arsenal, Liverpool, Barcelona and AC Milan in passing. 'Watch this space' is the message, but we can't help feeling that whoever does land Cole is getting a very healthy deal indeed, drawing similarities with Juventus' signing of Andrea Pirlo on a free deal. AND THE REST Tottenham and Arsenal are both interested in Netherlands World Cup centre-back Joel Veltman... QPR manager Harry Redknapp is considering a move for former Arsenal striker Eduardo... Southampton are ready to make a move for Livorno striker Paulinho... Netherlands defender Daryl Janmaat, 24, interests Newcastle and Manchester United... Swansea will listen to offers for Spanish striker Michu as they look to seal a deal for Ecuador winger Jefferson Montero... West Ham are lining up a £12m move for Ecuador World Cup sensation Enner Valencia... Leicester City boss Nigel Pearson is weighing up a £5m bid for Sunderland striker Connor Wickham.	sports
Mediawatch, Mailbox, Ref365, John Nicholson, Spanish Thing | Football365	Germany have been roundly criticised over the last week, but against France they were ominously recognisable. Die Maschine has clicked into knockout stage mode... Restricting the number of foreign players will only exacerbate England's problems, according to one Mailboxer. We also have the tragedy of Wesley Brown and more on Scouse maths... If Cesc Fabregas can struggle in a side he was supposedly born to play for, anybody can struggle at Barcelona. Luis Suarez will have to adapt and adapt quick... We have a wonderful new approach to Anfield arithmetic in the Mailbox. There is also a heartfelt goodbye to Luis Suarez and "Juan Mata probably voted UKIP"... We might be sentimentally liking Brazil or be blown away by Colombia, but England fans should cheer on our near neighbours to protect those World Cup places... This World Cup has made our goggle-eyed pair too soft - they've even got nice things to say about Andy Townsend and Robbie Savage. And Gary Lineker is king...	sports
Football365 | Mediawatch	Why aren't England as good as France, Luis Suarez is more villainous than Lance Armstrong and Steven Howard imagines a blast... Luis Suarez explains why he really wouldn't be happy at Barcelona, Oscar struggles to impose himself, there's quite a coincidence in The Sun and more... Martin Samuel has found the real reason for England's failure, while Adam Lallana's dreams have changed in spectacular fashion. Plus Lawro wishes it was the 1970s... Sorry but we have to turn to Adrian Durham and Martin Samuel again...because they keep writing nonsense. Apparently Lineker should have cheated like, erm, Suarez... The Daily Mail exclusively reveal a new nationality for Morgan Schneiderlin, Martin Samuel argues that being English should not be a crime and Philippe Senderos is an unlikely hero... Just 'how close' did Cristiano Ronaldo come to winning the World Cup. This is certainly the day in Ronaldo's career that Mediawatch will remember...	sports
Mediawatch, Mailbox, Ref365, John Nicholson, Spanish Thing | Football365	Like everyone else, our Johnny has hugely enjoyed this superb tournament. He believes that's down to a collective blending of physicality, skill and direct football... Jack Wilshere never got better, Theo Walcott hasn't improved, so why are we assuming that Ross Barkley, Luke Shaw, Daniel Sturridge etc will be better in two years? This World Cup has demonstrated the potential for a team to be greater than the sum of its parts. Now England must learn that vital lesson, says John Nicholson... ...so trying to find somebody or something to blame or change is pointless. We've failed with young, old, expectation, no expectation, English, foreign and everything else... Now it's a no-brainer. Perhaps John Nicholson is being a tad naive, but he doesn't believe there would even be an outcry if Hodgson dropped Wayne Rooney... A farcical World Cup opener had Johnny questioning whether in fact he was in the midst of mind-bending psychedelic experience.	sports

Mediawatch, Mailbox, Ref365, John Nicholson, Spanish Thing | Football365	After a pulsating, absorbing match Brazil have made it through to the semi-finals. It may not have been pretty, but there should be no marks awarded for aesthetics... Germany have been roundly criticised over the last week, but against France they were ominously recognisable. Die Maschine has clicked into knockout stage mode... We might be sentimentally liking Brazil or be blown away by Colombia, but England fans should cheer on our near neighbours to protect those World Cup places... While the World Cup throbs in Rio, Manchester United have signed Ander Herrera, the man who could be the catalyst for a quick-thinking change of mindset... USA won the hearts of many in their defeat to Belgium, but Jurgen Klinsmann must add some finesse if they are to take Russia by storm in 2018, says Tim Stannard. Belgium continued their rather haphazard route through the competition with extra-time victory over USA, but Eden Hazard continues to be slightly uninspiring...	sports
Mediawatch, Mailbox, Ref365, John Nicholson, Spanish Thing | Football365	Doing just enough for victory after the introduction of a young French forward and marking the departure of an established player to Manchester City. How very, very Arsenal... We're not a fan of meaningless marks out of ten, so here's a ratings system you can really get on board with. From 'breaded ham' to 'cat litter' with plenty in between... Ashley Cole showing a genuine emotion, Kallstrom's last match and Newcastle fans actually wanting their club to be run in an ethical manner. These are heady times indeed... It was a performance that encapsulated everything that Mourinho stands for and desires. On a sunny morning in Liverpool, Jose came, he saw and he ruined the party... It's easy to criticise Mike Dean for another catalogue of errors, but he should really be congratulated for such an impressive display of winding-up Rui Faria and Chelsea. Liverpool got the 'fear' at times on Sunday, but Vincent Kompany was there to allow the little kid to carry on sprinting. The sort of mistake that wins or loses a title race...	sports
Mediawatch, Mailbox, Ref365, John Nicholson, Spanish Thing | Football365	Spain haven't got a great deal to gain out of their final fixture against Australia. As Tim Stannard says, the post-mortem is already firmly underway... After the degradation suffered against the Netherlands on Friday, Spain must now pick themselves up and beat Chile. A World Cup final arrives three weeks early... Eyebrows have been raised about the inclusion of Fernando Torres in the Spain squad but Tim Stannard argues that his form in big games justifies the decision...

The Result Is King - A New Brazilian Template | Mediawatch, Mailbox, Ref365, John Nicholson, Spanish Thing | Football365	Latest Articles Germany have been roundly criticised over the last week, but against France they were ominously recognisable. Die Maschine has clicked into knockout stage mode... Restricting the number of foreign players will only exacerbate England's problems, according to one Mailboxer. We also have the tragedy of Wesley Brown and more on Scouse maths... The sun may still rise over Copacabana beach if and when Brazil are eliminated from this World Cup, but there will be a communal sense that things will never again be as wonderful. On Friday night the country's players proved themselves worthy holders of the responsibility in prolonging such a dream. It has been a rocky road but Brazil march on - they are now just one more victory away from the Maracana, and the chance to redress the nightmare of the 1950 Maracanazo. This was 90 minutes to assault each and every one of your senses. It may not have been a victory in the style for which Brazil has been famed, but in truth that died as normality a long time ago. This is a country that won World Cups in 1994 and 2002 with grit, guts and raw passion - against Colombia all three were required in spades. It is a sugary cliché, but this was a match in which there deserved to be no losers. The first half was as close as is conceivable to footballing nirvana, an atmosphere made almost impossibly fervent by the a capella renditions of the anthems, before being whipped up further into a frenzy by a game played at an unprecedented pace.. At times it felt as if footballing style was being reinvented as central defenders sprinted sixty yards with the ball, defenders took goal kicks, players shot from distance and the referee struggled to gain any semblance of control. This was South American football, nay any football at its enthralling, brilliant best, a match stuck in the sixth gear of all-out-attack, with defending as limp as wet cardboard left out in a thunderstorm. There were evident mistakes and imperfections, but these only seemed to fuel the feeling that we were watching something unique. We waited just seven minutes for the opening goal, nudged home from a corner by Brazil's captain Thiago Silva. Silva received a great deal of criticism following the Chile tie for watching the penalties away from his team-mates, seemingly overcome with the emotion and magnitude of the situation. This was his almost instant redemption, the beating of chest as he wheeled away his method of demonstrating just how strong a leader he could be. He was the first Brazilian captain to score in a World Cup since Rai in 1994, and will hope to follow in Rai's footsteps all the way to lifting the trophy next Sunday. Importantly for Brazil and Luiz Felipe Scolari, the midfield performed at a far higher level than previously over the last three weeks. In the absence of the suspended Luis Gustavo, Paulinho was restored to the starting line-up but selected in a more reserved role alongside Fernandinho - both were utterly brilliant in both fire-fighting and destroying. At the centre of Paulinho and Fernandinho's fine work was Carlos Velasco Carballo, the Spanish referee whose leniency became almost comical. When Thiago Silva was booked for blocking David Ospina's kick from hands, Carballo issued the first yellow card for the 41st foul of the match, a World Cup record. Brazil committed a total of 31 fouls in the match, a striking statistic, with Fernandinho incredibly fortunate to not see yellow. However, the outrage over such physicality must be muted slightly. Brazil may draw censure for their rough housing, but this isn't an unusual occurrence in South American football. Interestingly, when pushed for an answer after the match, Colombia coach Jose Pekerman refused to criticise Brazil for their approach. Instead, the Argentinean admitted that there was a "friction" to the match, but described it as "the same for both teams". I am inclined to agree, and whilst there appears to be something of a witch hunt for the conspiracy theorists that believe FIFA are somehow colluding to ease Brazil's passage, such talk is nonsense. Colombia committed 23 fouls themselves, with Neymar in particular receiving some harsh treatment. The news that he will miss the rest of tournament with a broken vertebrae will be mourned across this football-obsessed country. Thankfully (and typical of the spectacle), just as the game threatened to spill into the niggly and scrappy, a moment of genius wrestled it back into the mesmeric. If you were choosing one player in this World Cup to epitomise the unpredictability and excitement of this tournament it would be David Luiz - this is the poster boy of football irregularity. His free kick was majestic, soaring above the bar before dipping into the top corner of Ospina's goal. Even by the standards set by the first half, it took your breath away - unless you are Brazilian, in which case that breath was exhaled in relief. A final (and deserved) word too for James Rodriguez, the undoubted surprise star of this World Cup. He was kicked enough times during the match for he himself to be left unsure whether he was James or Ham-es, but the midfielder simply picked himself back up time and time again, desperate to further continue his distinction. Rodriguez will be sore in the morning, both physically and mentally, but should be immensely proud of his achievements. His late penalty made him the second youngest player to score six goals at a World Cup - only Pele beats him to that. It seems an odd statement to make about a player already the subject of a £35million move, but a star has been born. There seems a strange obsession with discrediting the achievements of this Brazil side, but the fact remains that despite the intense pressure upon them to win this tournament, they are in the semi-finals. We were told that Chile were the answer, but Brazil sent them home. We were told that Colombia were the answer, and Brazil have beaten them too. This is a side that just keeps on keeping on. This may not be the Selecao of 1970, but perhaps they are simply victims of comparison to those that have gone before. It might not be jogo bonito, but maybe we have become more obsessed with that ideal than the Brazilians themselves. Find a local in Rio de Janeiro this evening and ask them if they care about the how or the why. You'll probably have to stop them dancing first. Daniel Storey - Follow him on Twitter	sports

An Ominously Familiar German Knockout Performance | Mediawatch, Mailbox, Ref365, John Nicholson, Spanish Thing | Football365	Latest Articles After a pulsating, absorbing match Brazil have made it through to the semi-finals. It may not have been pretty, but there should be no marks awarded for aesthetics... Restricting the number of foreign players will only exacerbate England's problems, according to one Mailboxer. We also have the tragedy of Wesley Brown and more on Scouse maths... It may seem alien to followers of the England national team, but Germany were roundly criticised after qualifying for their ninth consecutive World Cup quarter-final with victory over Algeria. Both Per Mertesacker and Thomas Muller reacted to newspaper headlines that accused Die Nationalmannschaft of being under par and uninspiring, with Mertesacker in particular voicing his anger at such a slating for a team preparing for their tie against France. "Do you think that in the last sixteen there's some kind of Carnival troupe or something like that?" the Arsenal defender argued. "They [Algeria] made it really hard for us over 120 minutes and we fought until the end, and then convinced, especially in extra time. All that matters is we're in the quarter-finals." One assumes that a third consecutive single-goal victory, this time against France in Rio de Janeiro's Maracana stadium, will not draw such censure. Germany now advance towards a record fourth consecutive World Cup semi-final - this is, without doubt, the most consistent country in world football. Whether it was a direct result of (or response to) such widespread disapproval, Germany's performance and team selection certainly felt as if Joachim Low was demonstrably answering his critics. 'Right everyone, you've had you fun. We're going to do this properly,' one imagines the coach thought to himself. 'Philipp, you're a full back so we're going to pick you there. And Miroslav, a team needs a striker and you're our only one. So you're starting.' After the experimentation of the group stage, this felt like Die German World Cup Maschine clicking firmly into knockout mode setting. France had very little in response. Germany looked instantly more fluid with Klose in the striker role. He may still remain level with Ronaldo on 15 goals and be slower on the turn than Thomas Muller, but the veteran's sheer presence gives the German side greater balance and structure - Muller and Mesut Ozil can dovetail in behind. The defence too looked stronger, partly through the removal of Jerome Boateng from the right-back position, partly through the omission of the (excellent but) slower-paced Per Mertesacker from a defence intending to play with a high line and partly through the sheer magnificence of Mats Hummels. The Borussia Dortmund man made seven clearances, three blocks, and two interceptions, with the partridge in the pear tree arriving in the form of the game's only goal, a header taken with consummate ease. The best headers (see too Robin van Persie's against Spain) are those made to look easy despite, in reality, being hugely difficult to control, and this was a perfect example. Hugo Lloris was left entirely helpless. Hummels' header, in coming from a set piece, was described tongue-in-cheek as an 'English goal' on social media, but it once again highlighted the importance of delivery from dead-ball situations. 27.1% of the goals in this World Cup have now come from set pieces (42 goals), and four of the five teams that top this particular table all remain in the competition, France being the exception. The goal was also Germany's only shot on target of the first half but, whilst they were clinical, Didier Deschamps will be left to rue the early profligacy of his forwards. Les Bleus were able to gain a modicum of success from the long diagonal ball played to either Antoine Griezmann or Karim Benzema on the left wing, but looked toothless in front of goal. Benzema had seven shots in the match but looked lethargic when presented with opportunities. Mathieu Valbuena's left-footed shot at least forced the ever-excellent Manuel Neuer into a one-handed stop, but Benzema seemed slow to react, and his shot was blocked. That four of the striker's seven shots were blocked by defenders hints at a delay in pulling the trigger. There is nothing wrong with Benzema contributing very little other than goals to this French side when playing through the middle (he made just one pass during the entire first half, in comparison with 11 from Manuel Neuer), but it's a tactic that becomes deeply defective if those chances are then not taken. Neither Olivier Giroud or Loic Remy have proven themselves to be viable alternatives. If Low was happy with his side's work before the break, the German coach will be popping the second half into a file marked Perfektion. His central midfield trio of Bastian Schweinsteiger, Toni Kroos and Sami Khedira were able to starve the French midfield of possession, and in doing so suffocated any hopes of the comeback. They invited the French onto them with a confidence that attacks could be repelled before countering at pace. The only thing missing from a flawless performance was the second goal to act as cherry on top of cake, and twice Andre Schurrle missed from close range when afforded presentable chances on the break. Despite German solidity making things extremely difficult for his side, Deschamps should expect to be roundly criticised for his own performance. It was utterly transparent that Germany were happy to stifle and strangle the match during the second half, and yet the French coach seemed slow in his reaction to an alarming situation. It took 70 minutes before any substitution arrived, and even then it was to swap one central defender (Mamadou Sakho) for another in Laurent Koscielny. That Remy was given just 17 minutes and Giroud only five will surely be viewed as a coach left dawdling in response. It may have cost his side the chance to draw level. It was a quarter-final that never promised to live up to the scenes of 1982 and 1986, of Harald Schumacher, Patrick Battiston, Michel Platini and Rudi Voller, but Joachim Low will care not a jot. Given the weight of expectation pushed upon them this team is not yet a success story, but after the dissatisfaction of previous matches this was a very familiar Germany performance. This was more like the knockout side we know and try our hardest not to love - that's extremely ominous for the other sides left in the tournament. A remarkable twelfth World Cup semi-final awaits.

Foreign Restrictions Will Hurt England | Football365 | Opinion | Mailbox	Latest Articles We have a wonderful new approach to Anfield arithmetic in the Mailbox. There is also a heartfelt goodbye to Luis Suarez and "Juan Mata probably voted UKIP"... England lack balls, tactical nous and, well, everything, according to one mailboxer. We also have responses on Arsenal and debate on whether Messi is actually more Bon Jovi than Springsteen... If you have anything to say on any subject, mail us at theeditor@fooball365.com Restrictions Won't Help Considering all the debate regarding the number of foreign players in the Premier League, I thought of an interesting comparison that can be drawn in Economics; specifically regarding protectionist trade measures. Some countries have tried to implement these protectionist measures either by raising entry barriers to foreign companies and also subsidising their local businesses. The point of these measures are to 'build-up' their domestic businesses so that eventually, once the international trade barriers are dropped, the companies will be able to compete on a world wide scale. However, what typically happens is the opposite. Due to lack of domestic competition, firms become less competitive and less efficient. Meaning that even when the barriers are dropped that are still massively disadvantaged compared to the fiercely competitive multinationals. The point being that competition should be embraced as it drives innovation and improves performance. So rather than shunning foreign players, we should embrace them as they allow our home-grown talent to learn from them. This should also lead to only the most talented English youngsters developing as they relish the challenge of competing with the best, which should only benefit England. Incompetence breeds incompetence, so English players playing with each other in a limited talent pool will only increase the pool of talentless players to choose from. I guess the question is; would the FA prefer to be able to call on a small number of highly talented individuals, or a larger group of mediocre talent? LOH, Basel Aptly Named Probably not the only mail you'll get about this, but I am amused to note that a fallacy is defined as being "a deceptive, misleading or false notion or belief; a misleading or unsound argument; or any of various types of erroneous reasoning that render arguments logically unsound." I'd say Ziggy, LFC's "Sunk Cost Fallacy" has the perfect name. Terry Hall, Switzerland ...Something Ziggy LFC forgot to mention was that Andy Carroll actually cost Liverpool £-15m, as I remember. So with selling him for £15m, Torres for £50m and Dracula for £80m, and they've made £160m on strikers recently. Not bad. Coming up next week - scouse gravity: why Steven Gerrard didn't actually fall over and scupper his only chance of winning the league. Neil Raines ...Ziggy, LFC. The 'Sunk Cost Fallacy' is defined as thus... The idea that a company or organization is more likely to continue with a project if they have already invested a lot of money , time , or effort in it, even when continuing is not the best thing to do: Economists would point out that the sunk cost fallacy is irrational , and could be described as " throwing good money after bad ". I appreciate that this is business orientated definition, so I have attempted to transfer its principle to football. If you have bought a player for £35million, hardly use him, and sell him a year or so later for £15million you have lost £20million on him. As this is widely accepted as economics a comparative 'Footballing Sunk Cost Fallacy' would be to continue to try and somehow manipulate the numbers to show that it isn't a £20million loss when it quite clearly is. Football fans would point out that the 'Footballing Sunk Cost Fallacy' is irrational , and could be described as " trying to forget your team made a massive cock up". Liverpool fans, you'll make money on Suarez, just accept Andy Carroll was a mistake and end this 'Scouse Math' madness. Chris ITFC, Liverpool Big, Bad Wesley Brown Much as I agree with a lot of Vik M's morning email, the slur against Wes Brown was viscious. John O'Shea may well have been the platonic example of a squad player (albeit also a nutmegger of Figo, and scorer of wonderful late goals in front of the Kop), but Wes Brown was far, far more talented. But for his tendency to serious injury, he'd have spent the last decade as one of United's two first team centre-backs, and his performances when consistently fit and playing (see the 2007/8 season) were exceptional. Chris MUFC Prem Priorities I see that Low trotted out the old line about Mr Foreigner's presence in the Premier League bringing the England team down. To my mind, it seems that this view is completely missing the point. The majority of English representation at the World Cup came from the Premier League, which is billed by the Man as the biggest and most OMGest league in the world. On top of that, certain players also have European football, which also attracts a rather high level of attention. Is it too much to believe that an England player perhaps sees the domestic and European competitions as the pinnacle of his career, rather than the World Cup? FIFA's shindig isn't paying the bills, is only on every four years and is at the end of a knackering season. At the end of the day, being in the England team is a perk of the job and there is no tangible downside to losing. Can we really be surprised if there are poor performances, if this is indeed the mind-set of players? "Ah well, never mind lads, see you at Old Trafford/Anfield/the Emirates next year." Hardly a booby prize, is it? Contrast this with the USA. Few players have European experience (I may be wrong and I'm too lazy to check) and the World Cup genuinely is the pinnacle of their careers. Once they lose, some of the players may not be seen on the world stage until the next World Cup. Everyone is lauding them as heroes now. I realise that this is a pretty sweeping generalisation and there a number of factors such as national attitudes, media pressure, etc. which affect a team's performance. However, I strongly believe that as long as the Premier League continues to have the profile it does, the England team cannot succeed. So I guess we have to choose: domestic success or international glory? Gareth Hughes Where's The Fun? This is an argument that is usually used for Premier League clubs in European competitions but was today used by Phillip Cornwall in respect to international tournaments: The idea that a side should cheer on their bitterly hated rivals in the hope of possibly receiving an easier qualification passage or group stage opponents in the future, because their success will alter the numbers a governing body will use to calculate rankings n sh*t. I really struggle to think of a more joyless way to look at football. I think trying to work out which Premier League playmaker completes the most key passes per 90 is pretty bland, but at least that's done with the intention of giving you some thoughts the next time you watch Ozil or Mata strut their stuff. Coefficient watching really involves taking any possible reason to have an emotional attachment to anything in football - love, hatred, longing, rivalry, hope - and replacing it with maths. "Alright mate, you going to watch that horrible lot down the road play Bayern tonight? Hope Muller and co destroy them. I want to see loads of shots of sullen, disappointed fans." "No, I hope they win tonight and go on to achieve the success their fans long for. Maybe in 2-3 years if we actually qualify for the Champions League we'll be more likely to be put in a higher pot and face much smaller teams in the group stages" Will, THFC (aware this was not entirely what Mr Cornwall was arguing) What Next? I cant be the only Liverpool fan thinking this. Yes he's a total c**t, yes he's damaged the clubs reputation and yes he will most likely cause negative headlines again....but who are we actually going to replace him with? Who is as good, available for transfer and willing to make the switch? Martin (if Blackpool need an over weight, mediocre midfielder I'd be happy to help out, since they're so short on personnel. I'll even bring the oranges) Jackson Arsenal Exits Vik M, MUFC states that Arsenal have famously lost Ashley Cole for £5,000 a week and Vieira and Campbell for not offering longer than a year-long contract. It was previously policy at Arsenal to only offer one year contracts to players over 30 (a policy that was good enough for Bergkamp, by the way ) but this had no bearing on the Vieira/Campbell moves. Vieira was sold before he was 30 and was never subject to the one year contract issue. I was a calculated decision from the club (although not one I agree with) - here's Wenger's quote: "When Cesc Fàbregas was 18, 19, I would play him in a 4-4-2 with Patrick Vieira and I saw it did not work. Then I had the decision to make about letting Patrick go, because Gilberto Silva and Vieira worked, Fabregas and Silva worked, but I could not play Fàbregas and Vieira. But Fàbregas was 19 and if he did not play I knew he would want to go, so we risked destroying everything, all the work we had put into this player." Campbell had gone AWOL mid season and had something of a breakdown - his head just wasn't right and (if memory serves) we actually cancelled his contract to let him go. Neither of those players went because of the one year thing. I agree with a lot of what you say in your letter - how can you quantify flair for instance. But in those two cases, I think you're mistaken. Doug AFC (In brackets I'll remind everyone: Sol Campbell, 644 senior appearances with 4 different clubs, across 20 consecutive PL seasons winning 1 League Cup, 2 Premier Leagues, 4 F.A. Cups = £0 in Transfer fees. I think that's weird) Belfast English Exports These foreign players clogging up the Premier League and preventing young Brits from progressing: They represent their national teams, they thrive in other countries. Why aren't the young Brits travelling abroad for work like the young Portuguese and Spanish? Those young foreign trainees coming through English youth systems, why isn't that happening in Spain with young English players? There are greater cultural factors at play here. People are not thinking outside of the box. HughGolden Claret Cole Graeme Souness reckons Ashley Cole is moving to play games rather than for the money. If that's the case can I suggest he rock up to St. Mary's Stadium, Odemwingie style. Considering they just sold their main LB they should deffo have room for him. That no clubs have snapped him up yet beggars belief. Spurs could do with anyone but Danny Rose, Liverpool could do with some competition for young Flanno, and he'd be the best player at Newcastle, West Ham, Aston Villa etc. There's even a small chance I'd let him play for us instead of Ben Mee. Nick P, (I met Danny Ings this week!) Burnley FC Pompey Praise With all this talk about £80m for Suarez, stupid money for England players and net spend. Just wanted to say that I saw earlier today that Pompey fans have raised £100,000 towards a £250,000 target they need to improve facilities for their academy. The football world isn't all bad.

The Page That Needs A Sticker | Football365 | Mediawatch	Latest Articles Luis Suarez explains why he really wouldn't be happy at Barcelona, Oscar struggles to impose himself, there's quite a coincidence in The Sun and more... Martin Samuel has found the real reason for England's failure, while Adam Lallana's dreams have changed in spectacular fashion. Plus Lawro wishes it was the 1970s... Oooh La La Robbie Savage wants to know why England could not have done what France did and managed a 'complete reversal of fortune' since 2010. As he also says in his Daily Mirror column that Loic Remy 'looks a real threat' (he's played 11 minutes), perhaps we shouldn't take his views too seriously. But this is our job and we are nothing if not conscientious when it comes to reading nonsense from no-nothing fools. Firstly, what Savage doesn't mention is that France were drawn against Honduras (world ranking: 33), Switzerland (6) and Ecuador (26) at this World Cup, while England faced Italy (9), Uruguay (7) and Costa Rica (28). France's World Cup draw was widely heralded as a 'dream' while England clearly received a much stickier end of the stick. What Savage also fails to mention is the wealth of talent that has become available to Didier Deschamps, who - in contrast to 2010 - has Champions League winner Karim Benzema, £60m-rated midfielder Paul Pogba and phenomenal talents like Blaise Matuidi, Raphael Varane, Mamadou Sakho, Mathieu Debuchy, Yohan Cabaye and Antoine Griezmann at his disposal. Eliaquim Mangala - said to be a £32m target for Manchester City and Chelsea - cannot get in the starting XI. England? England have a central defence of Phil Jagielka and Gary Cahill; Phil Jones and Chris Smalling are in reserve. They have a midfield consisting of a 34-year-old and Jordan Henderson. Their most promising player is a 19-year-old who has not played in the Champions League. Should we go on? A pre-tournament study by Forbes concluded that France's squad was the fifth most valuable in the World Cup behind Brazil, Spain, Argentina and Germany. But why oh why could England not manage a complete reversal of fortune like France? C'est une mystere. A Moral List Mediawatch thinks that biting people is fundamentally wrong but mostly a bit weird. Does it think that biting makes Luis Suarez the sixth-worst villainous sportsperson of all time? Erm, not so much. What fool would? Step forward the Daily Mail's Jeff Powell, who has compiled a 'HALL OF SHAME' that puts Suarez just below a boxer who could have killed an opponent by having plaster of Paris taped onto his knuckles. But crucially just above serial doper and liar Lance Armstrong, match-fixer Hansie Cronje and drug cheats Ben Johnson, Marion Jones and Diego Maradona. In the curious moral maze of Powell's mind, all those crimes pale into insignificance next to biting a chap. Mediawatch notes that Powell does not mention rogue Suarez's history of using racist language and there is no room for John Terry in Powell's 20-strong list. There is room for a Ukrainian pentathlete who cheated at fencing in 1976, mind. Which is obviously much, much worse than using the words 'f***ing black c***'. Shear Shear This Mediawatch is exclusive. We know this because Mediawatch is paid to write this arsey, cynical look at football media (and broken penii) for Football365 and nobody else. Perhaps we should put an 'exclusive' tag on the top of the page like The Sun on their 'exclusive' Alan Shearer column, which is 'exclusive' basically because they pay their employee. So only readers of The Sun on Friday can read that... * 'Today's match-up in the Maracana means at least one European side will be in the semi-finals.' That's exclusive right there. * 'It could be as many as three with Holland and Belgium also flying the flag for Europe in the last eight.' This is all exclusive; strictly speaking, we shouldn't be repeating this stuff. * On Thomas Muller: 'It's fair to say he knows where the goal is.'

Actual quotes from Joachim Low: "If other countries like England have a problem, their league has a disadvantage because of a higher percentage of foreigners so it becomes difficult for the national coach to get things moving. "We have changed over recent years with lots of young German players in German clubs, given an advantage over foreigners and we're benefiting from that. In England there are many foreigners and perhaps that is not always beneficial." The eagle-eyed amongst you may spot that at no point does Low even vaguely say that England won't win the World Cup, or indeed mention any tournament at all. It's almost like this connection only exists in the fevered imagination of Steven Howard. Bring the old boy home...the heat is clearly getting to him. On The Same Page Steven Howard in The Sun: 'Waiting in the wings to replace him (Low) is Thomas Tuchel, the hugely successful but recently departed manager of Mainz.' Antony Kastrinakis in The Sun: 'His (Low's) reign will end if he fails to deliver here. Jupp Heynckes is likely to succeed him.' Do you trust the man 'at the heart of The Sun' or the self-appointed European Football Correspondent? Tough call. Unnecessary Quote Marks Of The Day 'BBC commentator Mark Lawrenson has come under fire for a 'sexist' comment made during the Argentina versus Switzerland World Cup game. Switzerland striker Josip Drmic's weak shot at goal during their round of 16 clash with Argentina on Tuesday evening prompted Lawrenson to state Drmic 'should have put a skirt on' - The 'sexist' Daily Mail. Naive Quote Of The Day "I don't have to prove [anything] - I've been a professional footballer for eight years" - Marouane Fellaini. Worst Headline Of The Day 'Frank is Tor-iffic' - The Sun. Toronto like Frank Lampard, you see. Non-Football Story Of The Day 'Some people are just never satisfied, as illustrated by a man with an enormous penis who wants surgery to make it even bigger.

O'Connor said he wants to make his penis into "a monster" and will undergo penoplasty to enlarge it. 'He has previously worked in pornography, but this procedure is being done purely for his own pleasure, he told Philip Schofield on This Morning.

The Result Is King - A New Brazilian Template | Mediawatch, Mailbox, Ref365, John Nicholson, Spanish Thing | Football365	Latest Articles Germany have been roundly criticised over the last week, but against France they were ominously recognisable. Die Maschine has clicked into knockout stage mode... Restricting the number of foreign players will only exacerbate England's problems, according to one Mailboxer. We also have the tragedy of Wesley Brown and more on Scouse maths... The sun may still rise over Copacabana beach if and when Brazil are eliminated from this World Cup, but there will be a communal sense that things will never again be as wonderful. On Friday night the country's players proved themselves worthy holders of the responsibility in prolonging such a dream. It has been a rocky road but Brazil march on - they are now just one more victory away from the Maracana, and the chance to redress the nightmare of the 1950 Maracanazo. This was 90 minutes to assault each and every one of your senses. It may not have been a victory in the style for which Brazil has been famed, but in truth that died as normality a long time ago. This is a country that won World Cups in 1994 and 2002 with grit, guts and raw passion - against Colombia all three were required in spades. It is a sugary cliché, but this was a match in which there deserved to be no losers. The first half was as close as is conceivable to footballing nirvana, an atmosphere made almost impossibly fervent by the a capella renditions of the anthems, before being whipped up further into a frenzy by a game played at an unprecedented pace.. At times it felt as if footballing style was being reinvented as central defenders sprinted sixty yards with the ball, defenders took goal kicks, players shot from distance and the referee struggled to gain any semblance of control. This was South American football, nay any football at its enthralling, brilliant best, a match stuck in the sixth gear of all-out-attack, with defending as limp as wet cardboard left out in a thunderstorm. There were evident mistakes and imperfections, but these only seemed to fuel the feeling that we were watching something unique. We waited just seven minutes for the opening goal, nudged home from a corner by Brazil's captain Thiago Silva. Silva received a great deal of criticism following the Chile tie for watching the penalties away from his team-mates, seemingly overcome with the emotion and magnitude of the situation. This was his almost instant redemption, the beating of chest as he wheeled away his method of demonstrating just how strong a leader he could be. He was the first Brazilian captain to score in a World Cup since Rai in 1994, and will hope to follow in Rai's footsteps all the way to lifting the trophy next Sunday. Importantly for Brazil and Luiz Felipe Scolari, the midfield performed at a far higher level than previously over the last three weeks. In the absence of the suspended Luis Gustavo, Paulinho was restored to the starting line-up but selected in a more reserved role alongside Fernandinho - both were utterly brilliant in both fire-fighting and destroying. At the centre of Paulinho and Fernandinho's fine work was Carlos Velasco Carballo, the Spanish referee whose leniency became almost comical. When Thiago Silva was booked for blocking David Ospina's kick from hands, Carballo issued the first yellow card for the 41st foul of the match, a World Cup record. Brazil committed a total of 31 fouls in the match, a striking statistic, with Fernandinho incredibly fortunate to not see yellow. However, the outrage over such physicality must be muted slightly. Brazil may draw censure for their rough housing, but this isn't an unusual occurrence in South American football. Interestingly, when pushed for an answer after the match, Colombia coach Jose Pekerman refused to criticise Brazil for their approach. Instead, the Argentinean admitted that there was a "friction" to the match, but described it as "the same for both teams". I am inclined to agree, and whilst there appears to be something of a witch hunt for the conspiracy theorists that believe FIFA are somehow colluding to ease Brazil's passage, such talk is nonsense. Colombia committed 23 fouls themselves, with Neymar in particular receiving some harsh treatment. The news that he will miss the rest of tournament with a broken vertebrae will be mourned across this football-obsessed country. Thankfully (and typical of the spectacle), just as the game threatened to spill into the niggly and scrappy, a moment of genius wrestled it back into the mesmeric. If you were choosing one player in this World Cup to epitomise the unpredictability and excitement of this tournament it would be David Luiz - this is the poster boy of football irregularity. His free kick was majestic, soaring above the bar before dipping into the top corner of Ospina's goal. Even by the standards set by the first half, it took your breath away - unless you are Brazilian, in which case that breath was exhaled in relief. A final (and deserved) word too for James Rodriguez, the undoubted surprise star of this World Cup. He was kicked enough times during the match for he himself to be left unsure whether he was James or Ham-es, but the midfielder simply picked himself back up time and time again, desperate to further continue his distinction. Rodriguez will be sore in the morning, both physically and mentally, but should be immensely proud of his achievements. His late penalty made him the second youngest player to score six goals at a World Cup - only Pele beats him to that. It seems an odd statement to make about a player already the subject of a £35million move, but a star has been born. There seems a strange obsession with discrediting the achievements of this Brazil side, but the fact remains that despite the intense pressure upon them to win this tournament, they are in the semi-finals. We were told that Chile were the answer, but Brazil sent them home. We were told that Colombia were the answer, and Brazil have beaten them too. This is a side that just keeps on keeping on. This may not be the Selecao of 1970, but perhaps they are simply victims of comparison to those that have gone before. It might not be jogo bonito, but maybe we have become more obsessed with that ideal than the Brazilians themselves. Find a local in Rio de Janeiro this evening and ask them if they care about the how or the why. You'll probably have to stop them dancing first. Daniel Storey - Follow him on Twitter	sports
An Ominously Familiar German Knockout Performance | Mediawatch, Mailbox, Ref365, John Nicholson, Spanish Thing | Football365	Latest Articles After a pulsating, absorbing match Brazil have made it through to the semi-finals. It may not have been pretty, but there should be no marks awarded for aesthetics... Restricting the number of foreign players will only exacerbate England's problems, according to one Mailboxer. We also have the tragedy of Wesley Brown and more on Scouse maths... It may seem alien to followers of the England national team, but Germany were roundly criticised after qualifying for their ninth consecutive World Cup quarter-final with victory over Algeria. Both Per Mertesacker and Thomas Muller reacted to newspaper headlines that accused Die Nationalmannschaft of being under par and uninspiring, with Mertesacker in particular voicing his anger at such a slating for a team preparing for their tie against France. "Do you think that in the last sixteen there's some kind of Carnival troupe or something like that?" the Arsenal defender argued. "They [Algeria] made it really hard for us over 120 minutes and we fought until the end, and then convinced, especially in extra time. All that matters is we're in the quarter-finals." One assumes that a third consecutive single-goal victory, this time against France in Rio de Janeiro's Maracana stadium, will not draw such censure. Germany now advance towards a record fourth consecutive World Cup semi-final - this is, without doubt, the most consistent country in world football. Whether it was a direct result of (or response to) such widespread disapproval, Germany's performance and team selection certainly felt as if Joachim Low was demonstrably answering his critics. 'Right everyone, you've had you fun. We're going to do this properly,' one imagines the coach thought to himself. 'Philipp, you're a full back so we're going to pick you there. And Miroslav, a team needs a striker and you're our only one. So you're starting.' After the experimentation of the group stage, this felt like Die German World Cup Maschine clicking firmly into knockout mode setting. France had very little in response. Germany looked instantly more fluid with Klose in the striker role. He may still remain level with Ronaldo on 15 goals and be slower on the turn than Thomas Muller, but the veteran's sheer presence gives the German side greater balance and structure - Muller and Mesut Ozil can dovetail in behind. The defence too looked stronger, partly through the removal of Jerome Boateng from the right-back position, partly through the omission of the (excellent but) slower-paced Per Mertesacker from a defence intending to play with a high line and partly through the sheer magnificence of Mats Hummels. The Borussia Dortmund man made seven clearances, three blocks, and two interceptions, with the partridge in the pear tree arriving in the form of the game's only goal, a header taken with consummate ease. The best headers (see too Robin van Persie's against Spain) are those made to look easy despite, in reality, being hugely difficult to control, and this was a perfect example. Hugo Lloris was left entirely helpless. Hummels' header, in coming from a set piece, was described tongue-in-cheek as an 'English goal' on social media, but it once again highlighted the importance of delivery from dead-ball situations. 27.1% of the goals in this World Cup have now come from set pieces (42 goals), and four of the five teams that top this particular table all remain in the competition, France being the exception. The goal was also Germany's only shot on target of the first half but, whilst they were clinical, Didier Deschamps will be left to rue the early profligacy of his forwards. Les Bleus were able to gain a modicum of success from the long diagonal ball played to either Antoine Griezmann or Karim Benzema on the left wing, but looked toothless in front of goal. Benzema had seven shots in the match but looked lethargic when presented with opportunities. Mathieu Valbuena's left-footed shot at least forced the ever-excellent Manuel Neuer into a one-handed stop, but Benzema seemed slow to react, and his shot was blocked. That four of the striker's seven shots were blocked by defenders hints at a delay in pulling the trigger. There is nothing wrong with Benzema contributing very little other than goals to this French side when playing through the middle (he made just one pass during the entire first half, in comparison with 11 from Manuel Neuer), but it's a tactic that becomes deeply defective if those chances are then not taken. Neither Olivier Giroud or Loic Remy have proven themselves to be viable alternatives. If Low was happy with his side's work before the break, the German coach will be popping the second half into a file marked Perfektion. His central midfield trio of Bastian Schweinsteiger, Toni Kroos and Sami Khedira were able to starve the French midfield of possession, and in doing so suffocated any hopes of the comeback. They invited the French onto them with a confidence that attacks could be repelled before countering at pace. The only thing missing from a flawless performance was the second goal to act as cherry on top of cake, and twice Andre Schurrle missed from close range when afforded presentable chances on the break. Despite German solidity making things extremely difficult for his side, Deschamps should expect to be roundly criticised for his own performance. It was utterly transparent that Germany were happy to stifle and strangle the match during the second half, and yet the French coach seemed slow in his reaction to an alarming situation. It took 70 minutes before any substitution arrived, and even then it was to swap one central defender (Mamadou Sakho) for another in Laurent Koscielny. That Remy was given just 17 minutes and Giroud only five will surely be viewed as a coach left dawdling in response. It may have cost his side the chance to draw level. It was a quarter-final that never promised to live up to the scenes of 1982 and 1986, of Harald Schumacher, Patrick Battiston, Michel Platini and Rudi Voller, but Joachim Low will care not a jot. Given the weight of expectation pushed upon them this team is not yet a success story, but after the dissatisfaction of previous matches this was a very familiar Germany performance. This was more like the knockout side we know and try our hardest not to love - that's extremely ominous for the other sides left in the tournament. A remarkable twelfth World Cup semi-final awaits.

Transfer news: Sunderland striker Nacho Scocco wanted by Newell's Old Boys | Football365 | Premier League News	Newell’s Old Boys vice-president Jorge Ricobelli admits the club would like to bring Nacho Scocco back to Argentina from Sunderland.

Scocco made the switch to Sunderland from Brazilian side Internacional during the January transfer window, but made just six appearances for the Premier League club and failed to score. During a three-year spell at Newell’s, Scocco netted 16 goals in 76 appearances and a season-long loan from Al Ain saw the attacker score 24 times in just 33 matches. The Sunderland Echo quoted Ricobelli as saying: “It is our wish to sign Scocco. Nacho has to report back for training in Sunderland. “We have made some efforts, but he now needs to return to the club [Sunderland] so we can continue with talks and we will listen to whether Sunderland want to let Scocco leave. “We have no problem looking at either a loan or purchase, as long as it is within the means of our club.” Scocco has two years remaining on his contract with Sunderland but Ricobelli is determined to bring the player back to his boyhood club and claims it would be a major boost for Argentinian football. “The idea is to make the effort and analyse all the possibilities,” he added. “The expectation is real, but it is a difficult situation. If we manage to bring Nacho back, it will be a totally extraordinary situation.”	sports

The first half was as close as is conceivable to footballing nirvana, an atmosphere made almost impossibly fervent by the a capella renditions of the anthems, before being whipped up further into a frenzy by a game played at an unprecedented pace.. At times it felt as if footballing style was being reinvented as central defenders sprinted sixty yards with the ball, defenders took goal kicks, players shot from distance and the referee struggled to gain any semblance of control. This was South American football, nay any football at its enthralling, brilliant best, a match stuck in the sixth gear of all-out-attack, with defending as limp as wet cardboard left out in a thunderstorm. There were evident mistakes and imperfections, but these only seemed to fuel the feeling that we were watching something unique. We waited just seven minutes for the opening goal, nudged home from a corner by Brazil's captain Thiago Silva. Silva received a great deal of criticism following the Chile tie for watching the penalties away from his team-mates, seemingly overcome with the emotion and magnitude of the situation. This was his almost instant redemption, the beating of chest as he wheeled away his method of demonstrating just how strong a leader he could be. He was the first Brazilian captain to score in a World Cup since Rai in 1994, and will hope to follow in Rai's footsteps all the way to lifting the trophy next Sunday. Importantly for Brazil and Luiz Felipe Scolari, the midfield performed at a far higher level than previously over the last three weeks. In the absence of the suspended Luis Gustavo, Paulinho was restored to the starting line-up but selected in a more reserved role alongside Fernandinho - both were utterly brilliant in both fire-fighting and destroying. At the centre of Paulinho and Fernandinho's fine work was Carlos Velasco Carballo, the Spanish referee whose leniency became almost comical. When Thiago Silva was booked for blocking David Ospina's kick from hands, Carballo issued the first yellow card for the 41st foul of the match, a World Cup record. Brazil committed a total of 31 fouls in the match, a striking statistic, with Fernandinho incredibly fortunate to not see yellow. However, the outrage over such physicality must be muted slightly. Brazil may draw censure for their rough housing, but this isn't an unusual occurrence in South American football. Interestingly, when pushed for an answer after the match, Colombia coach Jose Pekerman refused to criticise Brazil for their approach. Instead, the Argentinean admitted that there was a "friction" to the match, but described it as "the same for both teams". I am inclined to agree, and whilst there appears to be something of a witch hunt for the conspiracy theorists that believe FIFA are somehow colluding to ease Brazil's passage, such talk is nonsense. Colombia committed 23 fouls themselves, with Neymar in particular receiving some harsh treatment. The news that he will miss the rest of tournament with a broken vertebrae will be mourned across this football-obsessed country. Thankfully (and typical of the spectacle), just as the game threatened to spill into the niggly and scrappy, a moment of genius wrestled it back into the mesmeric. If you were choosing one player in this World Cup to epitomise the unpredictability and excitement of this tournament it would be David Luiz - this is the poster boy of football irregularity. His free kick was majestic, soaring above the bar before dipping into the top corner of Ospina's goal. Even by the standards set by the first half, it took your breath away - unless you are Brazilian, in which case that breath was exhaled in relief. A final (and deserved) word too for James Rodriguez, the undoubted surprise star of this World Cup. He was kicked enough times during the match for he himself to be left unsure whether he was James or Ham-es, but the midfielder simply picked himself back up time and time again, desperate to further continue his distinction. Rodriguez will be sore in the morning, both physically and mentally, but should be immensely proud of his achievements. His late penalty made him the second youngest player to score six goals at a World Cup - only Pele beats him to that. It seems an odd statement to make about a player already the subject of a £35million move, but a star has been born. There seems a strange obsession with discrediting the achievements of this Brazil side, but the fact remains that despite the intense pressure upon them to win this tournament, they are in the semi-finals. We were told that Chile were the answer, but Brazil sent them home. We were told that Colombia were the answer, and Brazil have beaten them too. This is a side that just keeps on keeping on. This may not be the Selecao of 1970, but perhaps they are simply victims of comparison to those that have gone before. It might not be jogo bonito, but maybe we have become more obsessed with that ideal than the Brazilians themselves. Find a local in Rio de Janeiro this evening and ask them if they care about the how or the why. You'll probably have to stop them dancing first. Daniel Storey - Follow him on Twitter	sports
Transfer news: Swansea boss Garry Monk set for talks with Michu amid speculation | Football365 | Premier League News	Swansea City manager Garry Monk is set to hold talks with Michu next week as speculation over the striker’s future continues to mount. Last Updated: 05/07/14 at 14:03 Post Comment Michu: Set for talks with Swansea City manager Garry Monk over his future Club chairman Huw Jenkins recently denied claims Swansea had agreed a deal with Serie A side Napoli, although the Italian club and Atletico Madrid are reported to still be interested in the forward. The 28-year-old has two years left on his current deal at the Liberty Stadium, but the Spain international endured an injury-plagued campaign last season which limited him to just 15 starts and only two goals. Former Rayo Vallecano striker Michu netted 22 goals in his first term with Swansea, topping the club’s goal-scoring chart, and Monk sees the Spaniard as a key member of his squad. "I'm meeting Michu at the end of the week and we'll talk about things,” Monk told the South Wales Evening Post. “He's a quality player, a great lad, someone who scores goals so there will always be interest in someone like that. "We will sit down and see the best way to go forward, but as far as I'm concerned he's a Swansea City player and I hope that continues. "I want him to stay, but we're the same as every club in the world. If an offer comes in and it's right for the club and the player feels he wants to move on, then you discuss it. "As it stands we've had nothing concrete so there's nothing to discuss." Should Michu leave the Liberty Stadium this summer, his departure could be offset by the arrival of France international striker Bafetimbi Gomis, who will join the club on a four-year deal subject to international clearance.	sports

The Result Is King - A New Brazilian Template | F365 Says	Latest Articles Germany have been roundly criticised over the last week, but against France they were ominously recognisable. Die Maschine has clicked into knockout stage mode... We might be sentimentally liking Brazil or be blown away by Colombia, but England fans should cheer on our near neighbours to protect those World Cup places... The sun may still rise over Copacabana beach if and when Brazil are eliminated from this World Cup, but there will be a communal sense that things will never again be as wonderful. On Friday night the country's players proved themselves worthy holders of the responsibility in prolonging such a dream. It has been a rocky road but Brazil march on - they are now just one more victory away from the Maracana, and the chance to redress the nightmare of the 1950 Maracanazo. This was 90 minutes to assault each and every one of your senses. It may not have been a victory in the style for which Brazil has been famed, but in truth that died as normality a long time ago. This is a country that won World Cups in 1994 and 2002 with grit, guts and raw passion - against Colombia all three were required in spades. It is a sugary cliché, but this was a match in which there deserved to be no losers.

An Ominously Familiar German Knockout Performance | F365 Says	Latest Articles After a pulsating, absorbing match Brazil have made it through to the semi-finals. It may not have been pretty, but there should be no marks awarded for aesthetics... We might be sentimentally liking Brazil or be blown away by Colombia, but England fans should cheer on our near neighbours to protect those World Cup places... It may seem alien to followers of the England national team, but Germany were roundly criticised after qualifying for their ninth consecutive World Cup quarter-final with victory over Algeria. Both Per Mertesacker and Thomas Muller reacted to newspaper headlines that accused Die Nationalmannschaft of being under par and uninspiring, with Mertesacker in particular voicing his anger at such a slating for a team preparing for their tie against France. "Do you think that in the last sixteen there's some kind of Carnival troupe or something like that?" the Arsenal defender argued. "They [Algeria] made it really hard for us over 120 minutes and we fought until the end, and then convinced, especially in extra time. All that matters is we're in the quarter-finals." One assumes that a third consecutive single-goal victory, this time against France in Rio de Janeiro's Maracana stadium, will not draw such censure. Germany now advance towards a record fourth consecutive World Cup semi-final - this is, without doubt, the most consistent country in world football. Whether it was a direct result of (or response to) such widespread disapproval, Germany's performance and team selection certainly felt as if Joachim Low was demonstrably answering his critics. 'Right everyone, you've had you fun. We're going to do this properly,' one imagines the coach thought to himself. 'Philipp, you're a full back so we're going to pick you there. And Miroslav, a team needs a striker and you're our only one. So you're starting.' After the experimentation of the group stage, this felt like Die German World Cup Maschine clicking firmly into knockout mode setting. France had very little in response. Germany looked instantly more fluid with Klose in the striker role. He may still remain level with Ronaldo on 15 goals and be slower on the turn than Thomas Muller, but the veteran's sheer presence gives the German side greater balance and structure - Muller and Mesut Ozil can dovetail in behind. The defence too looked stronger, partly through the removal of Jerome Boateng from the right-back position, partly through the omission of the (excellent but) slower-paced Per Mertesacker from a defence intending to play with a high line and partly through the sheer magnificence of Mats Hummels. The Borussia Dortmund man made seven clearances, three blocks, and two interceptions, with the partridge in the pear tree arriving in the form of the game's only goal, a header taken with consummate ease. The best headers (see too Robin van Persie's against Spain) are those made to look easy despite, in reality, being hugely difficult to control, and this was a perfect example. Hugo Lloris was left entirely helpless. Hummels' header, in coming from a set piece, was described tongue-in-cheek as an 'English goal' on social media, but it once again highlighted the importance of delivery from dead-ball situations. 27.1% of the goals in this World Cup have now come from set pieces (42 goals), and four of the five teams that top this particular table all remain in the competition, France being the exception. The goal was also Germany's only shot on target of the first half but, whilst they were clinical, Didier Deschamps will be left to rue the early profligacy of his forwards. Les Bleus were able to gain a modicum of success from the long diagonal ball played to either Antoine Griezmann or Karim Benzema on the left wing, but looked toothless in front of goal. Benzema had seven shots in the match but looked lethargic when presented with opportunities. Mathieu Valbuena's left-footed shot at least forced the ever-excellent Manuel Neuer into a one-handed stop, but Benzema seemed slow to react, and his shot was blocked. That four of the striker's seven shots were blocked by defenders hints at a delay in pulling the trigger. There is nothing wrong with Benzema contributing very little other than goals to this French side when playing through the middle (he made just one pass during the entire first half, in comparison with 11 from Manuel Neuer), but it's a tactic that becomes deeply defective if those chances are then not taken. Neither Olivier Giroud or Loic Remy have proven themselves to be viable alternatives. If Low was happy with his side's work before the break, the German coach will be popping the second half into a file marked Perfektion. His central midfield trio of Bastian Schweinsteiger, Toni Kroos and Sami Khedira were able to starve the French midfield of possession, and in doing so suffocated any hopes of the comeback. They invited the French onto them with a confidence that attacks could be repelled before countering at pace. The only thing missing from a flawless performance was the second goal to act as cherry on top of cake, and twice Andre Schurrle missed from close range when afforded presentable chances on the break. Despite German solidity making things extremely difficult for his side, Deschamps should expect to be roundly criticised for his own performance. It was utterly transparent that Germany were happy to stifle and strangle the match during the second half, and yet the French coach seemed slow in his reaction to an alarming situation. It took 70 minutes before any substitution arrived, and even then it was to swap one central defender (Mamadou Sakho) for another in Laurent Koscielny. That Remy was given just 17 minutes and Giroud only five will surely be viewed as a coach left dawdling in response. It may have cost his side the chance to draw level. It was a quarter-final that never promised to live up to the scenes of 1982 and 1986, of Harald Schumacher, Patrick Battiston, Michel Platini and Rudi Voller, but Joachim Low will care not a jot. Given the weight of expectation pushed upon them this team is not yet a success story, but after the dissatisfaction of previous matches this was a very familiar Germany performance. This was more like the knockout side we know and try our hardest not to love - that's extremely ominous for the other sides left in the tournament. A remarkable twelfth World Cup semi-final awaits.

The Result Is King - A New Brazilian Template | F365 Says	Latest Articles Germany have been roundly criticised over the last week, but against France they were ominously recognisable. Die Maschine has clicked into knockout stage mode... We might be sentimentally liking Brazil or be blown away by Colombia, but England fans should cheer on our near neighbours to protect those World Cup places... The sun may still rise over Copacabana beach if and when Brazil are eliminated from this World Cup, but there will be a communal sense that things will never again be as wonderful. On Friday night the country's players proved themselves worthy holders of the responsibility in prolonging such a dream. It has been a rocky road but Brazil march on - they are now just one more victory away from the Maracana, and the chance to redress the nightmare of the 1950 Maracanazo. This was 90 minutes to assault each and every one of your senses. It may not have been a victory in the style for which Brazil has been famed, but in truth that died as normality a long time ago. This is a country that won World Cups in 1994 and 2002 with grit, guts and raw passion - against Colombia all three were required in spades. It is a sugary cliché, but this was a match in which there deserved to be no losers. The first half was as close as is conceivable to footballing nirvana, an atmosphere made almost impossibly fervent by the a capella renditions of the anthems, before being whipped up further into a frenzy by a game played at an unprecedented pace.. At times it felt as if footballing style was being reinvented as central defenders sprinted sixty yards with the ball, defenders took goal kicks, players shot from distance and the referee struggled to gain any semblance of control. This was South American football, nay any football at its enthralling, brilliant best, a match stuck in the sixth gear of all-out-attack, with defending as limp as wet cardboard left out in a thunderstorm. There were evident mistakes and imperfections, but these only seemed to fuel the feeling that we were watching something unique. We waited just seven minutes for the opening goal, nudged home from a corner by Brazil's captain Thiago Silva. Silva received a great deal of criticism following the Chile tie for watching the penalties away from his team-mates, seemingly overcome with the emotion and magnitude of the situation. This was his almost instant redemption, the beating of chest as he wheeled away his method of demonstrating just how strong a leader he could be. He was the first Brazilian captain to score in a World Cup since Rai in 1994, and will hope to follow in Rai's footsteps all the way to lifting the trophy next Sunday. Importantly for Brazil and Luiz Felipe Scolari, the midfield performed at a far higher level than previously over the last three weeks. In the absence of the suspended Luis Gustavo, Paulinho was restored to the starting line-up but selected in a more reserved role alongside Fernandinho - both were utterly brilliant in both fire-fighting and destroying. At the centre of Paulinho and Fernandinho's fine work was Carlos Velasco Carballo, the Spanish referee whose leniency became almost comical. When Thiago Silva was booked for blocking David Ospina's kick from hands, Carballo issued the first yellow card for the 41st foul of the match, a World Cup record. Brazil committed a total of 31 fouls in the match, a striking statistic, with Fernandinho incredibly fortunate to not see yellow. However, the outrage over such physicality must be muted slightly. Brazil may draw censure for their rough housing, but this isn't an unusual occurrence in South American football. Interestingly, when pushed for an answer after the match, Colombia coach Jose Pekerman refused to criticise Brazil for their approach. Instead, the Argentinean admitted that there was a "friction" to the match, but described it as "the same for both teams". I am inclined to agree, and whilst there appears to be something of a witch hunt for the conspiracy theorists that believe FIFA are somehow colluding to ease Brazil's passage, such talk is nonsense. Colombia committed 23 fouls themselves, with Neymar in particular receiving some harsh treatment. The news that he will miss the rest of tournament with a broken vertebrae will be mourned across this football-obsessed country. Thankfully (and typical of the spectacle), just as the game threatened to spill into the niggly and scrappy, a moment of genius wrestled it back into the mesmeric. If you were choosing one player in this World Cup to epitomise the unpredictability and excitement of this tournament it would be David Luiz - this is the poster boy of football irregularity. His free kick was majestic, soaring above the bar before dipping into the top corner of Ospina's goal. Even by the standards set by the first half, it took your breath away - unless you are Brazilian, in which case that breath was exhaled in relief. A final (and deserved) word too for James Rodriguez, the undoubted surprise star of this World Cup. He was kicked enough times during the match for he himself to be left unsure whether he was James or Ham-es, but the midfielder simply picked himself back up time and time again, desperate to further continue his distinction. Rodriguez will be sore in the morning, both physically and mentally, but should be immensely proud of his achievements. His late penalty made him the second youngest player to score six goals at a World Cup - only Pele beats him to that. It seems an odd statement to make about a player already the subject of a £35million move, but a star has been born. There seems a strange obsession with discrediting the achievements of this Brazil side, but the fact remains that despite the intense pressure upon them to win this tournament, they are in the semi-finals. We were told that Chile were the answer, but Brazil sent them home. We were told that Colombia were the answer, and Brazil have beaten them too. This is a side that just keeps on keeping on. This may not be the Selecao of 1970, but perhaps they are simply victims of comparison to those that have gone before. It might not be jogo bonito, but maybe we have become more obsessed with that ideal than the Brazilians themselves. Find a local in Rio de Janeiro this evening and ask them if they care about the how or the why. You'll probably have to stop them dancing first. Daniel Storey - Follow him on Twitter	sports
An Ominously Familiar German Knockout Performance | F365 Says	Latest Articles After a pulsating, absorbing match Brazil have made it through to the semi-finals. It may not have been pretty, but there should be no marks awarded for aesthetics... We might be sentimentally liking Brazil or be blown away by Colombia, but England fans should cheer on our near neighbours to protect those World Cup places... It may seem alien to followers of the England national team, but Germany were roundly criticised after qualifying for their ninth consecutive World Cup quarter-final with victory over Algeria. Both Per Mertesacker and Thomas Muller reacted to newspaper headlines that accused Die Nationalmannschaft of being under par and uninspiring, with Mertesacker in particular voicing his anger at such a slating for a team preparing for their tie against France. "Do you think that in the last sixteen there's some kind of Carnival troupe or something like that?" the Arsenal defender argued. "They [Algeria] made it really hard for us over 120 minutes and we fought until the end, and then convinced, especially in extra time. All that matters is we're in the quarter-finals." One assumes that a third consecutive single-goal victory, this time against France in Rio de Janeiro's Maracana stadium, will not draw such censure. Germany now advance towards a record fourth consecutive World Cup semi-final - this is, without doubt, the most consistent country in world football. Whether it was a direct result of (or response to) such widespread disapproval, Germany's performance and team selection certainly felt as if Joachim Low was demonstrably answering his critics. 'Right everyone, you've had you fun. We're going to do this properly,' one imagines the coach thought to himself. 'Philipp, you're a full back so we're going to pick you there. And Miroslav, a team needs a striker and you're our only one. So you're starting.' After the experimentation of the group stage, this felt like Die German World Cup Maschine clicking firmly into knockout mode setting. France had very little in response. Germany looked instantly more fluid with Klose in the striker role. He may still remain level with Ronaldo on 15 goals and be slower on the turn than Thomas Muller, but the veteran's sheer presence gives the German side greater balance and structure - Muller and Mesut Ozil can dovetail in behind. The defence too looked stronger, partly through the removal of Jerome Boateng from the right-back position, partly through the omission of the (excellent but) slower-paced Per Mertesacker from a defence intending to play with a high line and partly through the sheer magnificence of Mats Hummels. The Borussia Dortmund man made seven clearances, three blocks, and two interceptions, with the partridge in the pear tree arriving in the form of the game's only goal, a header taken with consummate ease. The best headers (see too Robin van Persie's against Spain) are those made to look easy despite, in reality, being hugely difficult to control, and this was a perfect example. Hugo Lloris was left entirely helpless. Hummels' header, in coming from a set piece, was described tongue-in-cheek as an 'English goal' on social media, but it once again highlighted the importance of delivery from dead-ball situations. 27.1% of the goals in this World Cup have now come from set pieces (42 goals), and four of the five teams that top this particular table all remain in the competition, France being the exception. The goal was also Germany's only shot on target of the first half but, whilst they were clinical, Didier Deschamps will be left to rue the early profligacy of his forwards. Les Bleus were able to gain a modicum of success from the long diagonal ball played to either Antoine Griezmann or Karim Benzema on the left wing, but looked toothless in front of goal. Benzema had seven shots in the match but looked lethargic when presented with opportunities. Mathieu Valbuena's left-footed shot at least forced the ever-excellent Manuel Neuer into a one-handed stop, but Benzema seemed slow to react, and his shot was blocked. That four of the striker's seven shots were blocked by defenders hints at a delay in pulling the trigger.

Transfer news: Clement Grenier braced for Lyon exit after Newcastle link | Football365 | Premier League News	Reported Newcastle target Clement Grenier is braced for a move from Lyon, but admits any deal must benefit all parties involved. Last Updated: 05/07/14 at 13:29 Post Comment Clement Grenier: Set for a move away from Lyon should the right offer come The 23-year-old attacking midfielder has made 87 appearances for the Ligue 1 side since graduating from the club’s academy in 2009, but understands financial reasons could spell an end to his time at the Stade Gerland. Newcastle boss Alan Pardew attempted to sign Grenier during the January transfer window, but the club’s £8million bid was rejected by Lyon. Despite the rejection earlier in the year, Grenier remains open to a move away from Lyon, but insists the deal must suit his current club.  “You never know what can happen,” the Evening Chronicle quoted him as saying. “I think first I have to prepare myself. “I’m at Lyon, but I know that economic reasons may change that. If it happens then it will, in any case, the decision must be made together. “If it allows me to take the next step and it helps the club….For now, there is no news and I move forward with the club.”	sports

Transfer news: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer leaves Steven Caulker to mull over QPR switch | Football365 | Premier League News	Cardiff City manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer insists captain Steven Caulker will be left to make his own decision on a move after a fee was agreed with Queens Park Rangers. Last Updated: 05/07/14 at 12:59 Post Comment Steven Caulker: Could be on his way to QPR after Cardiff reached an agreement on Solskjaer confirmed the clubs have reached an agreement and admits it is down to the centre-back as to whether he will leave the Cardiff City Stadium. Although a deal appears to be close with Harry Redknapp’s QPR, who replaced Cardiff in the Premier League after winning the Championship playoff, Liverpool and Southampton are also reported to be interested in the 22-year-old. Caulker joined Cardiff last summer from Tottenham but was unable to keep the club in the Premier League, although he did impress personally, featuring in every minute of the Bluebirds’ campaign and netting crucial goals. The one-cap England international now looks set to return to the Premier League and, despite admitting it will be a loss for Cardiff, Solskjaer is keen to see a deal completed quickly. “The clubs have agreed a fee,” the Cardiff boss told Wales Online. “It’s been accepted and now it is up to Steven to decide. At the moment QPR is the only one I know about. I have spoken to them. “It’s up to Steven if he goes. Of course the lure of the Premier League might be too much for us to hope he might stay here. He has to make that decision. “You want to get the business done as soon as possible. We’ve shown that ourselves by signing players early on in the summer. It makes it easier then to get a settled squad.”	sports
Transfer news: Middlesbrough in talks to sign Danny Graham from Sunderland | Football365 | Premier League News	Championship side Middlesbrough are in talks to bring striker Danny Graham back to The Riverside from Sunderland, Sky Sports understands. Last Updated: 05/07/14 at 12:58 Post Comment Danny Graham: Looks set to return Middlesbrough where his career began The 28-year-old spent the closing stages of the 2013/14 season on loan at Middlesbrough and could now return to the club where his professional career started. Gateshead-born forward Graham was picked up by the then Premier League club from Chester-le-Street Town in 2003 and made 15 appearances during a four-year spell. Graham was loaned out five times during his first stint at The Riverside and two-year spells at Carlisle United, Watford and Swansea followed. After joining Sunderland in 2013, Graham started last season on loan with Hull City in the Premier League, but when his season-long loan deal was terminated on transfer deadline day in January, the striker joined Middlesbrough until the end of the campaign. During his time back at Boro, Graham scored six goals in 18 appearances as Aitor Karanka's side finished 12th in the Championship.	sports

Transfer News: Kyle Bartley signs new three-year deal with Swansea City | Football365 | Premier League News	Defender Kyle Bartley has become the latest player to commit his long-term future to Swansea City by signing a new three-year deal. Last Updated: 05/07/14 at 09:11 Post Comment Kyle Bartley: New three-year deal for Swansea defender The 23-year-old was due to become a free agent next summer but the Swans were keen to extend his deal after he impressed towards the end of last season on his return from a loan spell with Birmingham. News of Bartley's deal came less than 24 hours after captain Ashley Williams signed a four-year contract with the club to ward off the advances of Premier League rivals Sunderland. And Bartley hopes to play a much bigger role in boss Garry Monk's plans this season. “I spoke to the manager after the last game of the season at Sunderland and he was keen to extend my contract,” Bartley told the club's official website. “It’s brilliant for me because it’s a show of faith from the club and manager, and this season I really want to repay them for that by playing games and doing myself and the club proud.  “The manager is, first and foremost, an honest guy and he said if I work hard and show my ability then I’ll get a chance.  “The season is demanding with the Premier League and cup competitions, so everyone in the squad will be used and it’s up to them to perform and keep their spot in the team.  “The loan at Birmingham got my confidence back and made me stronger. I feel a better player for the games I was able to play there.  “It’s my third season and I’m only 23, but I feel confident in my own ability and I’m ready to pull that shirt on and do well.”	sports

Transfer news: Swansea eye move for Ecuador winger Jefferson Montero | Football365 | Premier League News	Sky Sports understands Swansea City are lining up a move for Ecuador winger Jefferson Montero.

Transfer news: Ashley Williams signs new four-year deal with Swansea | Football365 | Premier League News	Ashley Williams has committed his future to Swansea after signing a new four-year contract with the Premier League club. Last Updated: 04/07/14 at 20:15 Post Comment Ashley Williams: Swansea defender has signed new four-year deal The 29-year-old had only a year remaining on his previous deal and had been a summer target for Sunderland, who are understood to have had a number of offers rejected. The defender's agent, Jamie Moralee, revealed earlier this week that Swansea had told Williams he would not be leaving the club during the summer transfer window.

"There seems to a lot of talk every summer but I was quite relaxed. I always knew where I wanted to be. It was just a matter of working things out. "I've been here six years and this is home to me I didn't want to go anywhere else. I'm happy, I know Swansea and they know me. I'm just pleased to get it all sorted so early in the pre-season so I can just get my head down and kick on." Manager Garry Monk was equally pleased with the news that he can call on his defensive lynchpin for the foreseeable future. "He's an important player, the captain of his club and country," he told Sky Sports News. "I've said from the start that I have got a good relationship with Ashley, he is an integral part of this club, stabnds for a lot of the values that this club represents; it is important that we keep these sort of players at the club. "It's definitely one of the biggest signings we could have had. I explained to him exactly how we planned to go forward it's important that he understands how I work and how we want to take the club forward; he wants to be part of that and buys into that whole way of working. "I spoke to him from day one, of course you have interest form elsewhere; you get agents in your ear telling you this and that but Ashley always wanted to be here, deep down in his heart. Fortunately, we have managed to come to an agreement and it is great to have him."	sports

Last Updated: 04/07/14 at 18:13 Post Comment Wes Morgan: Agreed new deal at Leicester Leicester have been locked in talks with Morgan over a new deal for some time as they looked to secure his long-term future. Morgan has established himself as a key player in the Leicester side since arriving from Nottingham Forest in January 2012. Leicester took up the option to extend Morgan's deal in January for a further year to keep him at the King Power Stadium until 2015, but now they have moved to extend it even further. Morgan has signed a new three-year deal and follows the likes of Danny Drinkwater and Matty James who both signed new long-term contracts. The news of Morgan's deal will come as a massive boost to Leicester boss Nigel Pearson as he plans for life back in the Premier League. Morgan told the club's website: "I'm delighted to finally commit my future to this club. "Winning promotion with this squad last season and lifting the Championship  trophy were the proudest moments of my career and I can't wait to hopefully lead the team out on the opening day of the Premier League season. "We've all worked so hard to win promotion and the whole squad is determined to make the most of it. "There are some big challenges ahead in the next few years and I'm excited that I'm going to be part of it." Pearson felt it was key to secure the player's future with an important season ahead. "Wes has been every bit the captain we hoped he would be when we signed him two-and-a-half years ago," he said. "He's a leader on and off the pitch, sets a terrific example for young players and is an extremely positive influence on the squad. "He is one of number of players that has worked incredibly hard to reach the  Premier League, both during his time at Leicester and throughout his career, and he fully deserves the opportunity to test himself at that level. "I'm absolutely delighted that his long-term future remains with us." 	sports
Transfer news: Liverpool's Luis Suarez set to complete Barcelona move | Football365 | Premier League News	Luis Suarez's move from Liverpool to Barcelona could be completed before the end of the weekend, according to reports. Last Updated: 04/07/14 at 07:21 Post Comment Luis Suarez: Close to finalising a move to Barcelona Talks between the clubs are ongoing, with only the fee for the striker's services the wrangling point. Liverpool are holding out for £80m for their star forward - a sum that would activate a release clause in his contract - while Barcelona hope to lure him for a figure in the region of £60m. FIFA have already confirmed that Suarez will be allowed to have a medical ahead of a transfer, despite receiving a four-month ban from football. The 27-year-old left the World Cup in disgrace after biting opponent Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguay's group defeat to Italy. But an eventual apology for his latest indiscretion has smoothed the way for a switch to Spain and Barcelona's sporting director, Andoni Zubizarreta, publicly backed the striker earlier this week. "Suarez had the honour to come out and apologise for his actions and now it's time for him to begin the recovery process," Zubizarreta said. On Wednesday evening a Liverpool source confirmed: “The talks held today were productive, there are sensible expectations on both sides. Further talks and discussions are to take place, but nothing is finalised as of now."	sports

The 22-year-old said in a Q&A with adidas: “I have said in the past that I would like to play in Spain one day, because it is a league that is good technically and where you get a lot of touches on the ball, which is my style. “The Premier League is maybe a bit physical at this stage.  “But I am a Monaco player and I am not thinking about anything like that at the moment.

That has to be fair for everyone though. It needs to be the right deal for the Club and the player and if it is the right deal for Cressy then he was always going to want to move on. “He served his apprenticeship at Tranmere and then extended that here and became one of the best players in the Championship.” Cresswell, who will travel to France to join the West Ham squad for pre-season training, is likely to return to Portman Road when West Ham visit for a friendly on July 16.	sports

Transfer news: Ashley Williams always believed he would pen new Swansea deal | Football365 | Premier League News	Ashley Williams insists he was always focused on staying at Swansea City after signing a new contract at the club. Last Updated: 04/07/14 at 17:19 Post Comment Ashley Williams: Has committed his long-term future to Swansea The Wales captain has ended speculation over his future by signing a four-year deal to keep him at the Liberty Stadium until 2018. The news is a massive boost for Swansea after Williams was linked with a number of their Premier League rivals - with Sunderland seeing one bid for the centre-back knocked back. Williams admits it was flattering to be mentioned as a target for other clubs, but maintains that he always felt he would end up staying at Swansea. "I didn't feel I was going to end up anywhere else anyway so I was always focused on Swansea City," Williams told Sky Sports News Radio. "Obviously I just tried to relax over the summer and recuperate and really watched it play out in the media like everybody else did. "I didn't really say anything. There was a lot of speculation but I have kind of got used to it, especially over the last couple of years. It seems to be the same every year, just with different teams. "I didn't pay too much attention [to the speculation] and I have just seen what was going on and waited for the agreement with Swansea as we were both quite comfortable to sign here.” Asked if he was flattered by the interest, Williams added: "Yeah, definitely, I always say I just take it as a compliment as it means you are doing something right and that's just the way I look at it "I don't look too much in the speculation and stuff until something happens. “I am used to it, it is not the first time it's happened. It is what it is." Williams admitted the influence of manager Garry Monk played a big part in his decision to prolong his stay in South Wales. "Definitely, I have been in game long enough now to know it is important to have a good relationship with the manager, if you have a relationship or if you enjoying working with them, and I have got both," he added. "He is a friend of mine. I played with him for six years and I worked under him for a couple months at the end of last season and really enjoyed that time working for him, the way he trains and way he sets up his teams, so it was important. "It just means I was more than happy to sign again." Interview courtesy of New Era Global Sports.	sports

Transfer news: Liverpool and Barcelona make progress in Luis Suarez talks | Football365 | Premier League News	Liverpool and Barcelona have held "productive talks" over the potential transfer of Luis Suarez, according to Sky sources. Last Updated: 03/07/14 at 17:15 Post Comment Luis Suarez: Could be on his way to Barcelona Anfield managing director Ian Ayre met officials from Barcelona in London on Wednesday, with a Liverpool source confirming later that "the talks held today were productive, there are sensible expectations on both sides. "Further talks and discussions are to take place, but nothing is finalised as of now." Sky Sports News reporter Vinny O'Connor also confirmed that the future of Barcelona forward Alexis Sanchez was on the agenda, although it remains unclear whether the Chilean would be a separate deal or used as a makeweight for Suarez, with a number of other options also available to the player. Suarez is currently serving a four-month ban for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup. Following the 27-year-old's apology - which Barca reportedly had a major influence in procuring - the Primera Liga side have stepped up their pursuit. At a press conference on Wednesday, Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu would not be drawn on the talks. But he did he made a point of commending Suarez for apologising and confirmed they are in the market for a striker, as well as two new centre-backs. "I announced months ago that the team would undergo a deep renovation but we cannot reveal details because we don't want to give clues away to any of our rivals," Bartomeu said. "Our representatives are constantly travelling to other countries because of potential signings. "We have the names and the players, but sometimes there are clubs who speculate over possible signings by Barca to manipulate the price. "All I can say is that they are names that have been agreed with (new coach) Luis Enrique and they excite us.   "For example, (sporting director Andoni) Zubizarreta already has the names of the centre backs although they are not signed yet as there are clubs who think their value will go up after the World Cup." Asked about Suarez, Bartomeu said: "Suarez is a Liverpool player so I can't talk about him, he belongs to another team, a rival team. But we are all football men, and saying sorry is honourable, it helps the competition. "He did something that wasn't right, so it's the responsibility of everyone in football, be it Liverpool or anywhere else, to remember that he has said sorry. Admitting you have done something wrong is very important. "Luis has apologised and that is honourable, he's taken a step towards rehabilitating, the football world should support him and help him. As a football fan I hope he can turn a corner." Sky Sports' Spanish football pundit Guillem Balague believes Suarez had to apologise in order to secure his dream move to Barcelona. "Barcelona wanted Luis Suarez to apologise," he said. "It is also part of an appeal that will surely reduce his ban. "I realise many people feel cheated as he has apologised before. Biting shouldn't be done but can be corrected and Chiellini has accepted the apology, so who are we not to do the same?"

Transfer news: Tottenham in talks with Swansea over potential transfer of Ben Davies | Football365 | Premier League News	Tottenham are locked in talks with Swansea over the potential transfer of Ben Davies, according to Sky sources. Last Updated: 02/07/14 at 20:39 Post Comment Ben Davies: Tottenham still keen on the Swansea man The 21-year-old left-back, who thrived for the Swans last season, has become one of new manager Mauricio Pochettino's top transfer targets this summer. A deal was agreed in principle for the Wales international to move to White Hart Lane last week, but Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins pulled out of the arrangement in search of a better offer. Spurs, however, remain determined to capture Davies, who is valued by the Welsh club at £12million, and have begun fresh negotiations over a possible sale.  Swansea are thought to be very reluctant to sell a player who has made 71 appearances for the club since his debut in 2012.  Davies became a regular during the 2012-13 season following long-term injury to defender Neil Taylor, excelling under both previous manager Michael Laudrup and current boss Garry Monk. Davies, who has 10 caps for Wales, signed a one-year contract extension last year that keeps him tied to the Liberty Stadium until 2017. Tottenham, though, are in need of a left-back, with centre-back Jan Vertonghen filling in for the injured Danny Rose for large periods of last season.  Reports last month suggested they had moved for Sevilla youngster Alberto Moreno, but Tottenham are not interested in the Spaniard. 	sports

After the World Cup I am having a holiday. Then I will speak to them again. "With my agent, I now do not talk about the interest from clubs. I focus on the tournament."	sports

Last Updated: 04/07/14 at 16:42 Post Comment Jamaal Lascelles: Has been linked with a Premier League move for some time The 20-year-old defender has been generating Premier League interest for some time, with the likes of Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur reported to have been closely monitoring his development while he was still part of Forest’s academy ranks. The 2013/14 campaign proved to be a breakthrough one for Lascelles, with injuries to senior team-mates seeing him entrusted with a regular role at the heart of the back four. The youngster thrived under the responsibility and remained one of Forest’s most consistent performers as their season started to unravel after the turn of the year. Bids were expected this summer, with home-grown talent always highly sought-after. Top flight new boys QPR have made the first official approach, but they have been left in little doubt that the terms currently on the table fall some way short of Forest’s valuation. Not that the Reds have any intention of selling, with new boss Stuart Pearce determined to keep the youthful core of the squad he has inherited intact – with the likes of Karl Darlow and Henri Lansbury also generating transfer gossip.	sports

Transfer news: Sunderland striker Nacho Scocco wanted by Newell's Old Boys | News	Newell’s Old Boys vice-president Jorge Ricobelli admits the club would like to bring Nacho Scocco back to Argentina from Sunderland. Last Updated: 05/07/14 at 14:31 Post Comment Nacho Scocco: Attracting interest from former employers Newell's Old Boys The 29-year-old started his career with Newell’s and, despite the forward returning to the Stadium of Light for pre-season training, Ricobelli insists Old Boys will continue their efforts to sign the one-cap Argentina international. Scocco made the switch to Sunderland from Brazilian side Internacional during the January transfer window, but made just six appearances for the Premier League club and failed to score. During a three-year spell at Newell’s, Scocco netted 16 goals in 76 appearances and a season-long loan from Al Ain saw the attacker score 24 times in just 33 matches. The Sunderland Echo quoted Ricobelli as saying: “It is our wish to sign Scocco. Nacho has to report back for training in Sunderland. “We have made some efforts, but he now needs to return to the club [Sunderland] so we can continue with talks and we will listen to whether Sunderland want to let Scocco leave. “We have no problem looking at either a loan or purchase, as long as it is within the means of our club.” Scocco has two years remaining on his contract with Sunderland but Ricobelli is determined to bring the player back to his boyhood club and claims it would be a major boost for Argentinian football. “The idea is to make the effort and analyse all the possibilities,” he added. “The expectation is real, but it is a difficult situation.

Last Updated: 05/07/14 at 14:03 Post Comment Michu: Set for talks with Swansea City manager Garry Monk over his future Club chairman Huw Jenkins recently denied claims Swansea had agreed a deal with Serie A side Napoli, although the Italian club and Atletico Madrid are reported to still be interested in the forward. The 28-year-old has two years left on his current deal at the Liberty Stadium, but the Spain international endured an injury-plagued campaign last season which limited him to just 15 starts and only two goals. Former Rayo Vallecano striker Michu netted 22 goals in his first term with Swansea, topping the club’s goal-scoring chart, and Monk sees the Spaniard as a key member of his squad. "I'm meeting Michu at the end of the week and we'll talk about things,” Monk told the South Wales Evening Post. “He's a quality player, a great lad, someone who scores goals so there will always be interest in someone like that. "We will sit down and see the best way to go forward, but as far as I'm concerned he's a Swansea City player and I hope that continues. "I want him to stay, but we're the same as every club in the world. If an offer comes in and it's right for the club and the player feels he wants to move on, then you discuss it. "As it stands we've had nothing concrete so there's nothing to discuss." Should Michu leave the Liberty Stadium this summer, his departure could be offset by the arrival of France international striker Bafetimbi Gomis, who will join the club on a four-year deal subject to international clearance.	sports

Transfer news: Clement Grenier braced for Lyon exit after Newcastle link | News	Reported Newcastle target Clement Grenier is braced for a move from Lyon, but admits any deal must benefit all parties involved. Last Updated: 05/07/14 at 13:29 Post Comment Clement Grenier: Set for a move away from Lyon should the right offer come The 23-year-old attacking midfielder has made 87 appearances for the Ligue 1 side since graduating from the club’s academy in 2009, but understands financial reasons could spell an end to his time at the Stade Gerland. Newcastle boss Alan Pardew attempted to sign Grenier during the January transfer window, but the club’s £8million bid was rejected by Lyon. Despite the rejection earlier in the year, Grenier remains open to a move away from Lyon, but insists the deal must suit his current club.  “You never know what can happen,” the Evening Chronicle quoted him as saying. “I think first I have to prepare myself. “I’m at Lyon, but I know that economic reasons may change that. If it happens then it will, in any case, the decision must be made together. “If it allows me to take the next step and it helps the club….For now, there is no news and I move forward with the club.”	sports

Scouse Maths Has A Fancy New Name... | Football365 | Opinion | Mailbox	Latest Articles Restricting the number of foreign players will only exacerbate England's problems, according to one Mailboxer. We also have the tragedy of Wesley Brown and more on Scouse maths... England lack balls, tactical nous and, well, everything, according to one mailboxer. We also have responses on Arsenal and debate on whether Messi is actually more Bon Jovi than Springsteen... If you have anything to say on any subject, mail us at theeditor@fooball365.com The What Now? Since 'Net spend' and 'Andy Carroll' were both used in the last mailbox, I would really like to write in about a conversation I recently had about the 'sunk cost fallacy'. The idea of the fallacy is that once you've spent money on something, that cost should not factor in to any future decisions about the 'item' you paid for, but of course we all do and it is one of the reasons we try to win back money if we've lost it while gambling. The interesting thing is, once a team owns a player they need to completely disregard how much they paid for them and concentrate on the value they have in the present. To use Andy Carroll as an example, in 2011 Liverpool paid £35m for him and clearly they thought that was his correct value to the team. By 2013 Liverpool had a striker on the books and a bid came in for £15m which clearly exceeded their valuation and they sold him. Now, the argument is Liverpool 'lost' £20m on Carroll but they way it should be looked at is they sold a striker they didn't need for £15m (which in isolation was probably quite a good move). I hope no one writes in to the mailbox about the combined cost of Suarez and Carroll in 2011 and the combined amount they've been sold for as it is completely irrelevant. In 2013 a not-terribly-good striker was sold for £15m and in 2014 a terribly good striker will be sold for (what appears to be) £80m let's just leave it at that. Ziggy, LFC It's All B*llocks "When the fizzy drinks and trainers ads show him walking down the street and getting involved in an impromptu kickabout, part of me wants to believe he would actually be like that." Fraser (Skid Row rules), Edinburgh, I think you answered your own question in yesterday's mailbox. For the first few years of Messi-mania his 'down to earth, quiet lad who never dives' persona (which sat in stark contrast to the image many of us associate with footballers possessing a tenth of his ability) is what made him so much more attractive than the run of the mill egos we were used to. At first agents and advertisers weren't sure how to market this but they soon realised that we haven't really had an understated superstar in the modern footballing era. That was Messi's hook and I don't think it's a coincidence that he was modelled as the antithesis to the garish, in your face machismo of Cristiano Ronaldo. Sadly, as time's gone by, poor Leo's been revealed to be exactly as much of a prick as you would expect a multi-millionaire triple Ballon d'Or winner to be. It's all a load of b*llocks Fraser, b*llocks to generate a cult of personality to give their brand some edge. They're all pricks and all saints as much as the rest of us are, it's just that we don't have a PR team. Now it seems we've gone full circle and people are loving the mega-ego. Zlatan (C) says c**tish thing after c**tish thing and we all think he's brilliant for doing so. Ronaldo's head has been steadily growing to the point he rips his shirt off and points to various body parts and we all forgive the fact he's being a c**t because that's what people want to see, this is how we imagine them and their brilliance and bellishness become one and the same thing. Football is celebrity these days and every top footballer looking to make top dollar needs to get his act just right. Balotelli's probably not that troubled, John Terry probably wouldn't take a bullet and Juan Mata probably voted UKIP. Messi isn't the first and won't be the last to have a costume change so try not to worry about it too much and just enjoy the football. I'm really not sure where I've gone with this and I'm not having a go Frase. Maybe I'm just bitter. Simon CFC Don't Blame Johnny Foreigner It's easy to put the blame on the foreign players in BPL for the showing of the England's national team, especially with the showing of teams like Germany and Spain in recent years. Foreign players as I see it however, is an inevitable by-product of the all-conquering ambitions of English clubs with the amount of money in the game today. To put it in a way that any male reader could relate; If you were flushed with obscene amount of money, surely in no time you would be seen with the hottest chicks from around the world - Colombians, Spaniards and Germans - rather than just the ones at home right now. It's human nature that we want the best there is, and unfortunately, the ones at home just don't cut it at the moment. Of course, it's a logical balance to have a minimum number of English players in the team, but tilting this balance further will bring the quality of the teams down, which may result in English teams becoming irrelevant in the Champions League - Like the Portuguese/ Dutch leagues for example. This is the way that some ex-players have called for, but it's not ideal either. And if the BPL ever loses it's relevance, viewership/ money will flow out and BPL may see itself becoming the new Serie A. The main problem that remains unsolved however, is the lack of identity in English players. What do you think of when you think of England? Good Keepers? No. Good Defenders? Maybe. Good Midfielders? No. Good Strikers? No. How about good team-play? Absolutely no. If you answered these questions truthfully, it's really no surprise that England has failed to perform on international stage in the last decade or so. The core strategy should still be instilling of an identity - Whether it is to be good at simply parking the bus, or bringing back great wing play and wingers, English players need an identity. My football knowledge may be limited to just two decades or so, but I vaguely remember that English teams were the ones who popularised the 50-yard, cross field pass. It worked well for a while, but sadly, it hasn't gone further than that since then. Lastly, one pertinent question is this: Considering the number of high quality foreign imports that are brought into the league every season; Surely - theoretically at least - English players can only improve by playing and learning beside them? If so, then why is there a need for protectionist measures to ensure that English players get enough playing time? Competition should bring out the best in individuals and quite possibly, the sad truth is that the mindset towards self-improvement is sorely lacking at the moment, and removing foreigners from the league is hardly going to solve that. Gabriel, MUFC, Singapore. Punditry Pain I know that Belgium vs USA was a couple of days ago but it's been a busy week at work and this is the first chance I've had to write in. During half time of the Bel v USA game Gary Lineker asked whether the Belgium strikers had researched their opponent (Tim Howard) and noted that in a one-on-one situation he goes down early every time, leaving the Strikers with a chance to chip the ball over him. All three pundits (Ferdinand, Waddle and Shearer) nodded in agreement and said something along the lines of "Yeah when I was playing I would always research my opponent". At the same time in my head I immediately thought "Well Lukaku and Mirelles have been training with Howard all season. Surely if it's such an trait of Howard's, then they would have informed all the attackers in the Belgium squad?" (Except for Chadli...it's best to keep things simple with that lad...) All four of these 'experts' missed this 'Punditry Open Goal' and I'm betting I wasn't the only one at home thinking it either. As a massive footie fan who reads this lovely website of yours almost daily, this really p*ssed me off! It was my dream to be a professional footballers (all those page 3 girls...sigh...) but I realised about 15 years ago that I was never gonna make it and now would quite happily spend 8 hours a day researching teams, footballers, managers, formations, tweaks of formations, players within a squad best suited for said tweak of formation, etc etc and then share what I'd discovered with other like minded footie fans. Sure you might not agree with what I'd just said, but you couldn't accuse me of going on a lads jolly up and improving my handicap with Sav, Chrisy Wad, Big Ally, Scottish Ally, Rio-ally and Gazzy Lin! I remember watching Argentina vs Nigeria in the 2010 World Cup when Juan Sebastian Veron was popping the ball around in midfield and Mick McCarthy actually said "Is that THE Veron?!" FFS MICK!!! How many Bald 6ft Argentinian midfielders called Veron do you think there are? The fact that I knew he'd been ripping it up for Estudiantes, and his Father also played for them many years ago is my problem. But it was still evidence of a man being paid to watch one of the greatest shows on Earth and deciding that his extensive knowledge of all things relegation was enough for him to get by. Rant over...Bloody Pundits! Stephen, THFC Money's Too Tight To Mention While some reaction from Arsenal fans to being called a selling club was expected, I have to take exception to the absolute nonsense spouted by Dhruv (AFC). To start with, defining what makes a 'flair' player is much more difficult and subjective than even defining 'world-class'. If Dhruv has difficulty naming more than a few 'flair' players from Liverpool or Man Utd (in the past 10-15 years!) he should firstly switch the channel from Arsenal TV to a normal sports network like Sky Sports or ESPN or Star Sports or whatever, and take off the Arsenal-branded blinders that only allow wearers to see Arsenal players... or Barca. Look at the world around you and enjoy all the glory of football. Anyway he is right that Barca would probably not sign Cleverly, Fletcher or Smalling, or the handsome Mr. Jones. But then they would probably not sign Bendtner (perhaps in big Nick's alterante reality), Diaby, Flamini, or Jenkinson either. And they would probably take Henderson over Wilshere given the diminutive one's form over the past year. But then they signed Dymtro Chygrynskiy for 25 million EUR so what do we know!? Monster Masch has also been a regular for them for a while now, and only the reddest of the red Liverpool fans would describe him as a 'flair' player. As for Brown and O'Shea they both spent more than a decade with Man Utd, never becoming more than squad players, and were let go only after they turned 30, to make room for younger apprentices to Rio and Vidic. The fact that despite their limited talent they have more titles/trophies than most of Arsenal's 'flair' players speaks more to the genius of Sir Alex than anything else. They left to simply prolong their playing careers, and not to achieve their ambitions/trophies elsewhere like Forlan or Pique or Ronaldo or Becks or (this still hurts) Pogba. The best line though is "Wenger buys players who are generally gifted and maybe ambitious enough to test themselves in unfamiliar waters"... I think you meant to say good enough to earn a higher wage and more trophies elsewhere. Arsenal have famously lost Ashley Cole for 5k a week and Vieira and Campbell for not offering longer than a year-long contract. If these 'invincibles' were treated this way, could Adebayor, Nasri, Sagna or Clichy expect to be treated any better? Respect is a two way street. While the fans have showered love from the stands, the powers that be at Arsenal have let the players down. That is why they appear to have become a selling club. Vik M, MUFC (at least the Glazers are writing the checks needed to cover SAF's absence) False One Next season Pep gonna make Neuer's position as False One and everyone will laud him for changing football again. Kavit, India (For the record Pep you s**k) United Unbalanced I know it's the World Cup and everything but I just wanted to point out how imbalanced the current United team looks, given how van Gaal likes to set his teams up. Typically, he likes playing a 4-3-3. Assuming no more signings are made this summer, United's squad looks like this: Keepers: De Gea, Lindegaard, Amos; Will play in back four: Shaw, Evra, Jones, Rafael, Varela, Smalling, Keane, Evans (Vermaelen?); Can play in middle three: Fellaini, Carrick, Cleverley, Fletcher, Herrera; Will have to play in the front three: Kagawa, Rooney, van Persie, Mata, Hernandez, Januzaj, Valencia, Nani, Welbeck, Young. So unless Jones or Rooney or someone else is played out of their natural position in midfield (and we all know how consistent and reliable they are in midfield), I don't see how there are many options in the middle of the park (any 3 out of those 5 looks very weak). And TEN players competing for the three spots up front? I'm sure there'll be some more activity as far as transfers are considered (get rid of Young, even if you have to pay to get it done). The other option he has recently meddled with is the 5-3-2 (or the 3-5-2, depending on how you look at it). Rafael and Shaw can inject the much needed pace down the wings, thus eliminating the need to play Young, Valencia, etc. This will however mean a dearth in defensive options, the same lack of quality in midfield and a waste of the copious attacking talent. Sasank (and what's with van Gaal almost always revealing tactics and formations ahead of games, interesting time ahead!) Bangalore The Long Goodbye Bye then you amazing b*****d Somerset Dave Had Enough Am I the only person who is truly appalled that a human being can bite people and still, businesses want to pay this much money for publicity and shirt sales? FFS - Football, I'm sick of it. Go on, write those letters! Regards, Gifford in Sydney Bring Your Boots So basically what I think Ted, Manchester is saying is that all I have to do is turn up in Blackpool with my keeper gloves and I am pretty certain to get a few games for Blackpool next season! Get in! The dream is back on! Gavin MCFC (Blackpool's No.1, Blackpool's...Blackpool's No.1, Blackpool's No.1)	sports

World Cup Venues - ESPN FC	Snapshot: Along with Cuiaba, Manaus is most often appointed the "white elephant" of the 2014 World Cup. It is easy to see why. The best local club, Nacional, plays in Serie D and is watched by hundreds (on a good day) rather than thousands of fans, making the long-term prospects of the Arena Amazonia somewhat doubtful. But Manaus has a population of almost 2 million people, and the region represents almost 43 percent of the land mass of the country. Manaus is located in the middle of the rain forest, better served by river than road. The bustling docks area is always good fun, and the famed Teatro Amazonas (opera house), built at the height of the rubber boom, is unmissable. Boat trips up the river and into the jungle start from Manaus too. Getting there: Manaus is around 2,700 miles by road from Rio de Janeiro -- and it would not be advised to travel by car as the roads in the surrounding area are not well developed. Instead, a flight to Manaus' Eduardo Gomes International Airport is the most practical option; the journey takes four hours from Rio de Janeiro. With its location on the main avenue (Av. Constantino Nery) of the city and less than 3 miles from the old city centre, getting to the stadium should not be a problem, although beware the heat if you want to walk from your hotel as the average high temperature is 88 degrees Fahrenheit (31 degrees Celsius) with the humidity at times overwhelming. Where/what to eat: Forget barbecues and feijoada, the bean stew so famously associated to Brazil. Amazonian gastronomy will impress thanks to its access to unique ingredients. Fish (peixe) dishes are a must, given that more than 2,000 species inhabit the Amazon River (tambaqui and pacu are the most renowned varieties), but a lot of cassava-based stews are also popular. Exotic fruits like cupuacu, which tastes similar to a combination of pear and pineapple, are a treat for the untrained taste buds, while the now-mainstream superfood acai can be a refreshing alternative for the warmer times of the day. Banzeiro (Rua Teresina, 102) has a glowing reputation among locals, with the setting simple but the food and service top class. The Portuguese Alentejo (Rua Para, 555) excels with its cod dishes. Shin Surazan (Joao Valerio, 762) offers fantastic sushi with an eclectic mix of river food. Where/what to drink: Soak up the atmosphere at O Chefao (Rua Ferreira Pena, 50), where the decor is inspired by "The Godfather." Boasting a decent beer list, O Chefao also offers excellent sharing platters of such things as cheese and beef that make for a social evening out. At Bar do Armando (Rua 10 de Julho, 593), you can drink caipirinha lime with rum while observing passers-by on the seats outside. Fresh, cold beer is also in good supply, as are the cheese and ham sandwiches. Bar do Armando, in the centre of the city, guarantees cold beer, great appetisers and a full house every night. Manaus is surrounded by the lush green of the Amazon rain forest. Where to stay: The majority of the city's accommodations is located in the urban sprawl rather than in the rain forest itself -- although it is certainly possible to sleep amid the trees in one of the many lodges or pricier and plusher eco resorts. If you are feeling less adventurous, the Adrianopolis neighbourhood would be a wise bet as it is close to most of the sights. Area trivia: The now-retired Francisco Lima was born in Manaus and went on to represent a number of clubs across the globe. The defensive midfielder's clubs included FC Zurich, Lecce, Bologna, Roma, Lokomotiv Moscow and the San Jose Earthquakes before he returned to his hometown to feature for Nacional, Rio Negro and Sao Raimundo. Sightseeing: The Arena Amazonia is located in arguably the most important city in Brazil's Amazon region. Manaus is steeped in history, given its tales of pomp and doom following its role in the frenzy for rubber at the end of the 19th century. While the world's biggest rain forest is undoubtedly a tourist magnet, the capital of the Amazonas state has been eager to boost its image as a modern urban centre. The Amazonas Theatre is an impressive sight, dating from Manaus' golden age. If a concert coincides with your visit, do consider attending. If not, then perhaps take a guided tour. Meanwhile, the Mercado Municipal (Municipal Market) boasts a fine array of produce, food and souvenirs displayed in an impressive setting that has plenty of character. Adolpho Ducke's Botanical Garden, the small but interesting Tropical Zoo and the Natural History Museum will give you a great overview regarding the biodiversity of Amazonia. Definitely put time aside for at least a one-day trip to the rain forest, while the meeting of the waters, where the Rio Negro and Amazon River combine, is a captivating phenomenon. Consult your hotel about guided tours to these attractions. Arena Amazonia is to be opened: 2013 Matches to be played at Arena Amazonia: England vs. Italy (June 14), Cameroon vs. Croatia (June 18), USA vs. Portugal (June 22), Honduras vs. Switzerland (June 25). Capacity: 42,374 Cost: Estimates range from 500 million to 600 million reals ($230-275 million, 140-170 million pounds). Stadium history: The Arena Amazonia is situated in the place of the Vivaldao stadium, which after opening in 1970 was demolished in 2011 to make way for its more futuristic successor. The biggest local side is Nacional, who were founded in 1913. Stadium trivia: The ground is located in the Amazon rain forest, making for a stunning and unique setting. Being so close to nature, consideration for the environment has been at the forefront of the stadium's build, with a system in place so that rainwater is captured and reused to water the pitch or supply the restrooms. After the tournament has finished, the venue will, according to FIFA, host concerts and cultural events. However, reports in September claimed the venue could be used as a detention centre.

Netherlands vs. Costa Rica: 50-50 preview - ESPN FC	Netherlands sneaked into the quarterfinals following their late show against Mexico, while Costa Rica's fairytale continued with victory over Greece on penalties to get to this stage. Elko Born (Netherlands) and Matt Levin (Costa Rica) preview the tie. Sum up your tournament so far Elko Born: Expectations were low for Netherlands ahead of the tournament, but after victories against Spain, Chile and Mexico, that has changed. No longer able to manoeuvre themselves into the position of underdog, the Dutch will go into the quarterfinal as one of the stronger teams in the tournament. This could cause them to worry, but, while Dutch teams of the past have often reacted poorly to pressure, there is a feeling it might be different this time around. Matt Levin: The small Central American country has been the big surprise of the World Cup. The Ticos have carried the CONCACAF banner into the quarterfinals and along the way have defeated four-time tournament champions Italy and two-time champions Uruguay. That and a tie with 1966 World Cup winners England was enough for Costa Rica to top Group D. That triumph set them up in the second round with Greece and their negative football. Team captain and Fulham outcast Bryan Ruiz scored first in the 52nd minute, but a second yellow card for defender Oscar Duarte forced the Ticos to hold on for dear life the rest of the way. The Greeks equalised but would never crack goalie Keylor Navas, who played the game of his life in keeping his team alive in both regulation, overtime and penalty kicks. His teammates put on a clinic in the spot kicks, nailing all five attempts and sending La Sele to the World Cup quarterfinals for the first time ever. World Cup history between the two countries  EB: Netherlands have never faced Costa Rica before. The only player the Dutch will certainly be familiar with is Costa Rica's star man Ruiz, who has played for FC Twente and PSV Eindhoven in the Dutch Eredivisie. ML: Due to Costa Rica's limited World Cup history, these teams have never met before in a senior-level match. However, serious Tico fans do recall their country's 3-1 victory over the Netherlands at the Under-20 World Cup in Argentina in 2001. None of the players on that Costa Rican squad are on the current roster in Brazil, but the Dutch side did include 17-year-olds Arjen Robben and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, and, indeed, Louis van Gaal was the manager at the time. So those are three members of the Dutch team who knew the Ticos were capable of major upsets long before the World Cup started. What are your expectations for the rest of the tournament? EB: The tournament has seen Netherlands go through the high of putting five past Spain to the low of facing seemingly certain elimination against Mexico. So far, it has truly been a roller-coaster ride. But having come this far, the Dutch will now want to see things through all the way to the end. Especially after their hard-fought comeback against Mexico, there is a feeling in the country that fortune is on Netherlands' side. This time around, everything seems to be going right for Oranje, even when they seem to be going wrong. ML: Some fans seemed relieved to avoid hated rivals Mexico in the quarterfinals. For all the success Costa Rica have had in Brazil, supporters still didn't want their greatest nemesis to have the chance to eliminate them. Plus, the Netherlands seem like a more worthy opponent to potentially lose to, and the Dutch might just be the tournament favourite at this point. The Ticos don't seem to be backing down from the challenge that awaits them in the quarterfinals, but Costa Rica have plenty to overcome if they're going to shock the Dutch. Yellow cards and injuries are piling up. Exhaustion will be a factor, too, after the team went the distance against Greece. Yet La Sele will hope for more scorching weather in Salvador de Bahia. The Netherlands suffered in the sun against Mexico in the round of 16, while the Ticos have used the Brazilian humidity to their advantage against their European opponents. No matter what happens the rest of the way in Brazil, the team will return home as superstars. They've already accomplished the greatest performance in Costa Rica football history. Arjen Robben and the Netherlands hope to leap past another CONCACAF side in Saturday's quarterfinal versus Costa Rica. Key battle EB: Robin van Persie, Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder have shown they can be relied upon for goals, and so victory should be within reach for the Dutch, as long as they can prevent their opponents from scoring. On Costa Rica's side, goals are most likely to come from frontman Ruiz, who found the net against Italy and Greece. Netherlands' defenders, who might remember Ruiz from his time at FC Twente and PSV Eindhoven, must therefore do whatever it takes to neutralise the Costa Rica attacker. Expect Ron Vlaar to be picked as the man to fulfil this task. ML: Robben and van Persie versus Costa Rica's defence. This is the scariest attack Costa Rica's impressive back line have faced all tournament -- and they'll likely confront the Netherlands with newcomer Johnny Acosta at centre-back. The Costa Rica national league veteran represents quite the drop-off in talent from Duarte (suspended) and his backup Roy Miller (injured). Nevertheless, this team's World Cup run has been more about players working together in coach Jorge Luis Pinto's system than individual talent. That's why the Ticos have been able to shut down Italy's Mario Balotelli and England's Daniel Sturridge, among other top strikers. The health of Navas -- who's dealing with a shoulder injury -- will be paramount for La Sele. Also worth noting is the meeting of the minds on the sidelines. Costa Rica's Pinto and the Netherlands' Van Gaal have been perhaps the two best managers in Brazil. Pinto's excellent game planning prepared his team to outplay former World Cup champions. Van Gaal, the newly anointed head of Manchester United, turned the Oranje from a popular group-stage upset pick to a team on course for their second consecutive World Cup final. Prediction EB: Costa Rica might manage to score once, but if they do, the Dutch will score twice. I expect Netherlands to win 2-1 and reach the last four. ML: 3-1 Netherlands. The hotter the temperature in Salvador, the better the Ticos' chance to slow the Dutch. Even though the Netherlands shouldn't expect to cakewalk into the semifinals, this feels like the end of Costa Rica's Cinderella run.	sports

Argentina vs. Belgium: 50-50 preview - ESPN FC	Argentina and Belgium face each other in a mouth-watering quarterfinal in Brasilia this Saturday; Sam Kelly (Argentina) and Wim Van Walle (Belgium) preview the tie. Sum up your tournament so far: SK: Underwhelming, but touched by genius. As one of the more vocal champions (in English at least) of Argentina's free-scoring, fast-flowing attack, it's also been slightly embarrassing personally, to be frank. They've looked like an entirely different side from the one which swept through the qualifiers, unable to control the game when opponents have handed them the initiative and elected to defend deep, and subsequently less than convincing so far. Lionel Messi is proving a pretty useful trump card so far, but his teammates shouldn't be relying on him anything like so much. And yet they've managed four wins out of four so far, and as I was reminded by the locals when I went out for a coffee after Tuesday's match, "we're still in it, so it's still winnable." WV: Most expected Belgium to top Group H but there was much discussion about the way they eventually did. Belgium presented themselves as a cautious, uninspired team for most of the three games, choosing to finish their opponents off in the last 20 minutes. It wasn't pretty, but it was effective. But then came the second round game against the United States. Belgium looked like a different team. They sank their teeth in the game and never, not for one minute, let go. It was a mesmerizing display of relentless, attacking football. If not for the magnificent Tim Howard, it could have ended with a monstrous score line. This is how everybody expected the Red Devils to play, or even better. Suddenly, Belgium have three players in FIFA's team of the round, more than any other country. WC history between the two countries : SK: These sides have faced each other three times in total, all coming in the 1980s. Two of those meetings were in World Cups; in the 1982 first group stage, Belgium beat the then-holders 1-0 in the tournament's opening match, in Barcelona's Camp Nou (the stadium in which Argentina's young forward, Diego Maradona, would play his club football in the following season after being transferred from Boca Juniors). Four years later in the Estadio Azteca, Maradona scored twice to give Argentina a 2-0 win and take Argentina into the final. The sides haven't met since. WV: Belgium played Argentina twice before in a World Cup. In the opening game in Spain in 1982, the then vice-European champions beat the reigning world champions 1-0, courtesy of an Erwin Vandenbergh goal that has reached legendary status in Belgium. Four years later they met in the semifinals in Mexico. Belgium saw two promising attacks ruled out for non-existent offsides before Diego Maradona did that thing he did that summer and single-handedly steered his country to a 2-0 win. The first-ever game between the two came at the Amsterdam Olympics in 1928. Argentina won 6-3. There was also a friendly in 1984 which ended in a 2-0 Argentina win. Advantage Argentina as far as history goes. What are your expectations for the rest of the tournament? SK: I really don't know, because Argentina could continue to be as stodgy as they have been so far, or they could make the necessary adjustments -- or just manage to nod in one of the numerous set pieces they keep winning early on in matches -- and open the game up, allowing them to impose their own style on proceedings again. If either of those things happen, we should see the Argentina of the qualifiers, which we caught glimpses of in their last group stage game against Nigeria. They'll be under pressure in this one, though, and also have the huge expectation of finally getting beyond the quarterfinals -- a feat they haven't managed since Italia '90, when as defending champions they were dethroned by West Germany in the final. Psychologically, there's going to be a lot of pressure. WV: It's a tough one to call. Not one of the remaining countries is significantly stronger than the rest. Belgium and Colombia were the most convincing of the second round winners and Costa Rica are the tournament's surprise package. But it would be foolish to count out Brazil, Holland, France, Germany or, for that matter, Argentina. Even if they haven't played well and were lucky to survive Switzerland, they still have the mercurial talent of Messi, who can change a game even if he only gets a few touches. But they will do well to heed Maradona's warning: they will have to play a lot better or they will be in big trouble against Belgium. Key Battle: SK: Messi vs. Vincent Kompany. In the absence of any meaningful help from his midfielders -- and given the evidence of the tournament so far, we must assume that's going to continue -- Messi will again be Argentina's team going forward, rather than just their key man. Kompany's going to get close to him, probably aided by a fellow midfielder or defender, and things will be as tight as they have been all tournament thus far, unless Argentina can finally shake off their collective lack of interest and seek to properly exploit the space that putting two men on Messi will open up elsewhere in the Belgian formation. And of course, in every one of Argentina's games so far there's been a point when, however good that shackling of Messi has been throughout, he's finally broken free and won them the game (either scoring or, as he did on Tuesday, providing the assist). Can that pattern continue here? WV: A football game is never a direct battle between a forward and a goalkeeper but here are some key statistics: Belgium are unbeaten in 21 consecutive games with Thibaut Courtois in goal. Argentina haven't lost with Messi in 24 consecutive games. And Messi hasn't scored against Courtois in seven. The great Johan Cruyff once said: "The longer a run like that goes on, the more likely it becomes that it is ended." It remains to be seen which of these runs ends on Saturday. Messi can score at will against almost any opposition but Courtois is perfectly capable of "doing a Howard". Prediction: SK: Until now Argentina's results have been easy to predict because even while playing lethargically, they've had clearly the better quality. This game is a little different. Messi's been so ruthlessly effective, though, that I think he can make the difference again. I'm going for Argentina by a goal, though very possibly not in normal time. WV: Marc Wilmots has hinted that Belgium are not the favourites for this game. "We will have to adapt to Argentina," he said. "I have a plan in my head. But then again, I wonder how Argentina will adapt to us." Belgium will do well not to change too much. The Argentinian defence is shaky at best, and Nigeria demonstrated how vulnerable they can be against high-paced football. Goalkeeper Sergio Romero doesn't exactly ooze confidence either. With six different players already on the score sheet, Belgium must take their chances from every angle. Messi may score, but Belgium will score more. 2-1 Belgium.	sports

Belgium presented themselves as a cautious, uninspired team for most of the three games, choosing to finish their opponents off in the last 20 minutes. It wasn't pretty, but it was effective. But then came the second round game against the United States. Belgium looked like a different team. They sank their teeth in the game and never, not for one minute, let go. It was a mesmerizing display of relentless, attacking football. If not for the magnificent Tim Howard, it could have ended with a monstrous score line. This is how everybody expected the Red Devils to play, or even better. Suddenly, Belgium have three players in FIFA's team of the round, more than any other country. WC history between the two countries : SK: These sides have faced each other three times in total, all coming in the 1980s. Two of those meetings were in World Cups; in the 1982 first group stage, Belgium beat the then-holders 1-0 in the tournament's opening match, in Barcelona's Camp Nou (the stadium in which Argentina's young forward, Diego Maradona, would play his club football in the following season after being transferred from Boca Juniors). Four years later in the Estadio Azteca, Maradona scored twice to give Argentina a 2-0 win and take Argentina into the final. The sides haven't met since. WV: Belgium played Argentina twice before in a World Cup. In the opening game in Spain in 1982, the then vice-European champions beat the reigning world champions 1-0, courtesy of an Erwin Vandenbergh goal that has reached legendary status in Belgium. Four years later they met in the semifinals in Mexico. Belgium saw two promising attacks ruled out for non-existent offsides before Diego Maradona did that thing he did that summer and single-handedly steered his country to a 2-0 win. The first-ever game between the two came at the Amsterdam Olympics in 1928. Argentina won 6-3. There was also a friendly in 1984 which ended in a 2-0 Argentina win. Advantage Argentina as far as history goes. What are your expectations for the rest of the tournament? SK: I really don't know, because Argentina could continue to be as stodgy as they have been so far, or they could make the necessary adjustments -- or just manage to nod in one of the numerous set pieces they keep winning early on in matches -- and open the game up, allowing them to impose their own style on proceedings again. If either of those things happen, we should see the Argentina of the qualifiers, which we caught glimpses of in their last group stage game against Nigeria. They'll be under pressure in this one, though, and also have the huge expectation of finally getting beyond the quarterfinals -- a feat they haven't managed since Italia '90, when as defending champions they were dethroned by West Germany in the final. Psychologically, there's going to be a lot of pressure. WV: It's a tough one to call. Not one of the remaining countries is significantly stronger than the rest. Belgium and Colombia were the most convincing of the second round winners and Costa Rica are the tournament's surprise package. But it would be foolish to count out Brazil, Holland, France, Germany or, for that matter, Argentina. Even if they haven't played well and were lucky to survive Switzerland, they still have the mercurial talent of Messi, who can change a game even if he only gets a few touches. But they will do well to heed Maradona's warning: they will have to play a lot better or they will be in big trouble against Belgium. Key Battle: SK: Messi vs. Vincent Kompany. In the absence of any meaningful help from his midfielders -- and given the evidence of the tournament so far, we must assume that's going to continue -- Messi will again be Argentina's team going forward, rather than just their key man. Kompany's going to get close to him, probably aided by a fellow midfielder or defender, and things will be as tight as they have been all tournament thus far, unless Argentina can finally shake off their collective lack of interest and seek to properly exploit the space that putting two men on Messi will open up elsewhere in the Belgian formation. And of course, in every one of Argentina's games so far there's been a point when, however good that shackling of Messi has been throughout, he's finally broken free and won them the game (either scoring or, as he did on Tuesday, providing the assist). Can that pattern continue here? WV: A football game is never a direct battle between a forward and a goalkeeper but here are some key statistics: Belgium are unbeaten in 21 consecutive games with Thibaut Courtois in goal. Argentina haven't lost with Messi in 24 consecutive games. And Messi hasn't scored against Courtois in seven. The great Johan Cruyff once said: "The longer a run like that goes on, the more likely it becomes that it is ended." It remains to be seen which of these runs ends on Saturday. Messi can score at will against almost any opposition but Courtois is perfectly capable of "doing a Howard". Prediction: SK: Until now Argentina's results have been easy to predict because even while playing lethargically, they've had clearly the better quality. This game is a little different. Messi's been so ruthlessly effective, though, that I think he can make the difference again. I'm going for Argentina by a goal, though very possibly not in normal time. WV: Marc Wilmots has hinted that Belgium are not the favourites for this game. "We will have to adapt to Argentina," he said. "I have a plan in my head. But then again, I wonder how Argentina will adapt to us." Belgium will do well not to change too much. The Argentinian defence is shaky at best, and Nigeria demonstrated how vulnerable they can be against high-paced football. Goalkeeper Sergio Romero doesn't exactly ooze confidence either. With six different players already on the score sheet, Belgium must take their chances from every angle. Messi may score, but Belgium will score more. 2-1 Belgium.	sports

Lionel Messi will have to do better against Thibaut Courtois writes Miguel Delaney - ESPN FC	It is a sight every goalkeeper in the world fears, and the vast majority have ultimately failed to deal with: Lionel Messi bearing down on your goal, ready to distil all that talent into one decisive moment. For Asmir Begovic, it was an assault on the senses as much as his goal. "You can feel the pace of his play, the power he has. We tried to get two or three people around him every time he got the ball, but he shook everyone off." That goal against Bosnia and Herzegovina, which sealed a 2-1 victory for Argentina in their opening game, ignited Messi's World Cup campaign. Since then, he has completely banished so many pre-tournament debates about his World Cup legacy, while consistently breaking supposedly psychological barriers and reaching new landmarks. On Saturday, another significant block presents itself, and it is a literal one that may yet prevent Argentina from reaching the World Cup semifinals for the first time since 1990. It also represents something of an inversion of all the old debate surrounding his international career, since it is one area he has struggled with in club football. That is the daunting physical presence of Thibaut Courtois. Messi has not scored against the Atletico Madrid goalkeeper since December 2012, a drought that has now extended to seven games. Those seven matches also played a major part in ensuring the Barcelona creator last season suffered the first trophy-less campaign of his career since 2007-08. Messi has been largely unable to beat Courtois but how much of that is down to the goalkeeper? Now, in goal for Belgium, Courtois is the most immediate obstacle to Messi getting his hands on the trophy he desires above all else. To complete his legacy with the World Cup itself, the 27-year-old is likely going to have finish past the Belgian. "I know very well how to play against Messi," Courtois said this week. "We have come up against each other in various games between Atletico and Barcelona, although on those occasions the defeats were not his fault. Messi is a sensational player. He can decide a game in a second." Courtois has accumulated many minutes against Messi, which has meant he doesn't have to prepare in the usual way. That wouldn't exactly help anyway, however, since Messi is not a usual player. "The good thing is I don't have to watch videos of him because I know him so well," Courtois explained. "But, even if you watch videos of him, he's so unpredictable that it's impossible to study him to know what he's going to do. As soon as he finds a way to shoot, he will shoot, so the only thing you can do as a goalkeeper is concentrate at all times." The duel has already taken on other dimensions, given that it was Belgium that Argentina met on the way to the 1986 World Cup and saw Diego Maradona score another of those iconic goals. In truth, however, there also other dimensions to this battle right now. It is obviously much more than a mere mental block as Courtois indicated by saying it isn't all Messi's fault, effectively admitting it isn't all down to his goalkeeping. Messi's superb form at the 2014 World Cup gives him a good chance of pulling Argentina to victory. Most obviously, there was the defensive system set up by Diego Simeone at Atletico. It was widely praised in each of those seven games, generally seen as the primary reason for preventing Messi scoring. It wasn't quite that the No. 10 couldn't beat Courtois; it was that he couldn't get near enough to really try. Simeone's four-man blockade didn't allow Messi to work himself into those positions for his most productive shooting. You only have to look at the stats. In seven games, Messi had 16 shots, but only three were on target. As such, it wasn't really Courtois miraculously keeping out a siege. He may have to on Saturday, however, if Belgium don't set up a similar blockade. "It will be tough," Courtois said. "To hold on in defence, we must be very well-organised." This is perhaps the true intrigue to this quarterfinal: how both teams set up. Belgium finally looked liberated against the USA and possess the pace on the break to finally hurt Argentina. Courtois also referenced this. "Argentina have a very good attack, which does not just depend on Messi," the goalkeeper said, "but at the back they are not so strong. That is where we can do them damage." Argentina vs. Belgium: July 5 (ESPN and WatchESPN) - Van Walle: Belgian belief continues to grow - Laurens: Spotlight on Divock Origi - Macintosh: Player stocks, who's rising? - 50-50 Challenge: Argentina vs. Belgium - Five Aside: Group winners roll into quarters - Summer Transfers: Belgians are talk of town At the same time, surging forward in itself may be damaging for Belgium. Although Argentina have not been firing in attack, it might ignite them if a team suddenly offers up the space so often obstructed. That has been one primary reason Alejandro Sabella's side have not looked their best. None of the four teams they have played -- Bosnia-Herzegovina, Iran, Nigeria and Switzerland -- have been willing to step up. So Belgian manager Marc Wilmots has a decision to make. One thing is certain: given Messi's form, Wilmots absolutely must replicate Switzerland and Atletico in forming some kind of tactic to shuttle the playmaker out of the game. Thereafter, it will be revealing to see whether Sabella goes so gung ho in response. Given Belgium's own attack, the Argentina coach may seek to revert to the 5-3-2 used by Bosnia and Herzegovina that initially so isolated Messi. It would be ironic, yet it could also be the key to ending another trend, and offering a new sight: Messi finally finishing past Courtois in a match that really matters.

At £25 million Barkley would be seen as 'one for the future' while Rodwell would see his faltering career given a kick start by a return to his boyhood club according to the Daily Mirror. First, the obligatory Luis Suarez mention. All the latest on his proposed move to Barcelona can be found here. Ashley Cole to... Roma? Spare a thought for Ashley Cole, currently unemployed and not allowed to go to Brazil for a summer holiday with his chums from England. But wait -- what's this? A move to Roma, that's what. The folks at the Daily Mail say a two-year deal is on the table for the left-back. Cole's best years are behind him but he remains a perfectly capable left-back who will have a glut of options to choose from. Of those, it appears Roma are leading the hunt. Negredo no-go, so Atleti go for Mandzukic Time for a tale that could affect a whole raft of clubs across Europe. Atletico Madrid are desperate to sign Chelsea-bound Diego Costa's replacement and had been keen on Manchester City striker Alvaro Negredo, but it appears that ship has sailed. Not to be deterred, La Liga's champions are on to their "Plan B" -- Mario Mandzukic. That's according to Marca, who label the deal "very close." That could come as a blow to Arsenal. Arsene Wenger hasn't made a signing yet but is expected -- surely -- to sign a striker, and Bayern Munich's Mandzukic was said to be an option. But Atelti are in pole position to land the Croatia international, whose move could be made official within the next few days. Wenger not made a signing? Maybe we spoke too soon While their rivals have been busy splashing the cash this summer, Wenger has kept quiet -- until now. L'Equipe believe a signing is coming in the shape of Newcastle's Mathieu Debuchy for around 10 million Euros. A smart move, in our view. Bacary Sagna has departed for Manchester City and Arsenal need a right-back with Premier League experience. A decent start to their business for the FA Cup winners -- now for that elusive striker... Evra farewell? Patrice Evra signed a new contract with Manchester United at the start of the summer, so we're going to treat La Gazzetta dello Sport's story regarding his exit with caution. The report suggests Evra wants out of Old Trafford to join Juventus on a free, but having lost the experience of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic this summer, Louis van Gaal could probably do with keeping Evra around. You'd expect Luke Shaw to be first choice at United following his big-money move, but there's bound to be time for Evra next campaign. However, a move to Juve could actually make sense if Evra was used as a makeweight. Why, you ask? Read on... Juve for Sanchez sparks domino effect Bear with us on this one, it's rather juicy. Word from Spain is that Juventus are keen to sign Barcelona's Alexis Sanchez and such a move could be music to Manchester United fans' ears -- as well as wrecking the hopes of Arsenal and Liverpool. Sanchez is said to be part of Barcelona's negotiation package for Suarez, but Arsene Wenger is eager to take the Chilean to north London. However, the pair could end up disappointed if Juventus, long term admirers of Sanchez, get their way. The Old Lady want to sign the former Udinese man and Sport says they will be able to afford Sanchez if they sell Arturo Vidal. ESPNFC recently told you that Vidal was open to a move to Old Trafford, but Juventus want the bidding to start at around 45 million euros. So, selling Vidal to United could get them Sanchez, annoying Arsenal and Liverpool in the process. Got it? Reina to remain at Liverpool To be perfectly honest, Transfer Talk completely forgot Pepe Reina was still a Liverpool player. He is, though, and is returning to Brendan Rodgers' side this summer and could yet remain there. A permanent move to Napoli has been mooted but The Liverpool Echo say the Spaniard is ready to stay at Liverpool. But with Simon Mignolet the undisputed first choice, where does that leave Reina? We've got some details on that one as well -- step this way. Bits and Bobs - In-demand James Rodriguez fancies a La Liga switch. - Italy's dismal World Cup campaign scuppered Mario Balotelli's hopes of a return to the Premier League. - Gus Poyet's son, the talented free agent Diego, is snubbing Chelsea for West Ham. - Atletico Madrid player in "staying at the club" shock.

Messi gives hope to faltering Argentina - ESPN FC	BRASILIA, Brazil -- "Argentine Invaders" proclaimed Brasilia's local freesheet on Wednesday. Lionel Messi was described as a devil, too. A truism of this World Cup for Brazilians is that the only thing worse than their team failing would be Argentine victory. The sight of blue and white camper vans is becoming very familiar on the city's dual carriageways. Having heartily celebrated beating Switzerland in Sao Paulo, convoys started arriving on Thursday afternoon. By the evening, the shopping malls, bars and commercial areas were chiming with the sound of castellano Spanish. What Brazil and Belgium fear most from Argentina in a football sense is blatantly obvious. The Messi conundrum recalls that famous Bill Shankly anecdote from 1970 when he ran down almost an entire Manchester United team -- "Paddy Crerand, now he's deceptive, he's slower than he looks," etc. -- only omitting Denis Law, George Best and Bobby Charlton and then saying: "Are you trying to tell me that you can't beat a team that's only got three players in it?" "I repeat," said a grumpy Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella at his Friday news conference in Brasilia. "Any team that has a player like Messi will greatly depend on him as a player." However, if success is to be achieved, and at this stage against a strong Belgian opponent, Sabella needs more than one star to shine, especially so when he has concerns in most areas of his team. The defence looked vulnerable against the Swiss in Sao Paulo. Had Xherdan Shaqiri had a striker worthy of the name to complement him, then Argentina would already have been facing the music in Buenos Aires. Meanwhile, in midfield -- aside from the effervescent Angel Di Maria -- Argentina continue to lack fluency and guile, while all those forwards who have played off Messi have so far failed to score. While Leo Messi has been commended for his tournament, his teammates have been chastised. Sabella must also live with an overriding belief back home that Argentina are the best team in the tournament. Nothing less than victory will do, a conceit that flies in the face of Argentina not travelling further than a quarterfinal since 1990. "It's a cultural issue," said Sabella. "It's the way we are. When I was little I always heard we were the best, but we had not yet been world champions." Sabella was 24 at the time Argentina won their first title in 1978. Now, he and his team have been doused in criticism for a lack of support to the miracles of Messi, with Claudio Caniggia, who provided able support for Diego Maradona at Italia '90, leading the charge. "We have not reached the level we want to reach," Sabella admitted. "We have won with very tight results. We are looking for an improvement." The loss of Marcos Rojo to suspension is a major concern. The Sporting Lisbon full-back, initially the subject of considerable doubt, has been a slow-burning success story. There is far less confidence in his likely replacement, Jose Maria Basanta, of Monterrey in the Mexican league. Rojo, a long-standing Liverpool target, would seem far better equipped than Basanta to deal with Eden Hazard on the left flank, or indeed when Dries Mertens or Kevin de Bruyne are switched there by Belgium coach Marc Wilmots, as he might frequently do. Sabella, perhaps by way of diversion, intimated that his lineup might closely resemble that which closed out the round-of-16 game in Sao Paulo. That could mean that Inter Milan's Rodrigo Palacio, a striker by usual trade, may line up in midfield; it was his interception from there and the pass that set up Messi to supply Di Maria's winner against the Swiss. The disappointing Fernando Gago is a most likely fall guy.

"We have great confidence because he has always given good results in general terms," said Sabella, a dealer in faint praise of Fernandez. Which leaves the forwards. Sergio Aguero, Messi's friend and favourite foil, is only likely to play from the bench against Belgium, if at all. "He's doing quite well so we'll see how he responds to see if he can be part of the 23 on the bench," said Sabella of a striker hampered by injury after suffering the recurrence of the hamstring problem he first suffered at Tottenham in January. Aguero's absence places further pressure on Gonzalo Higuain, who has suffered a dreadful tournament so far, although Sabella has made allowances. "He was the player who ran the most," he said of the Napoli striker's performance against Switzerland. "He tries to cooperate in occupying the spaces." Such talk of occupation of space is part of there being almost zero pretence about Argentina's team servicing one man. "There's a team that makes him stronger and makes him feel well," said Sabella, praising his other charges' assistance in helping Messi shine for the first time at a World Cup. "Four years ago he was heavily criticised. Now we say that we greatly depend on Messi."	sports
Argentina vs. Belgium: 50-50 preview - ESPN FC	Argentina and Belgium face each other in a mouth-watering quarterfinal in Brasilia this Saturday; Sam Kelly (Argentina) and Wim Van Walle (Belgium) preview the tie. Sum up your tournament so far: SK: Underwhelming, but touched by genius. As one of the more vocal champions (in English at least) of Argentina's free-scoring, fast-flowing attack, it's also been slightly embarrassing personally, to be frank. They've looked like an entirely different side from the one which swept through the qualifiers, unable to control the game when opponents have handed them the initiative and elected to defend deep, and subsequently less than convincing so far. Lionel Messi is proving a pretty useful trump card so far, but his teammates shouldn't be relying on him anything like so much. And yet they've managed four wins out of four so far, and as I was reminded by the locals when I went out for a coffee after Tuesday's match, "we're still in it, so it's still winnable." WV: Most expected Belgium to top Group H but there was much discussion about the way they eventually did. Belgium presented themselves as a cautious, uninspired team for most of the three games, choosing to finish their opponents off in the last 20 minutes. It wasn't pretty, but it was effective. But then came the second round game against the United States. Belgium looked like a different team. They sank their teeth in the game and never, not for one minute, let go. It was a mesmerizing display of relentless, attacking football. If not for the magnificent Tim Howard, it could have ended with a monstrous score line. This is how everybody expected the Red Devils to play, or even better. Suddenly, Belgium have three players in FIFA's team of the round, more than any other country. WC history between the two countries : SK: These sides have faced each other three times in total, all coming in the 1980s. Two of those meetings were in World Cups; in the 1982 first group stage, Belgium beat the then-holders 1-0 in the tournament's opening match, in Barcelona's Camp Nou (the stadium in which Argentina's young forward, Diego Maradona, would play his club football in the following season after being transferred from Boca Juniors). Four years later in the Estadio Azteca, Maradona scored twice to give Argentina a 2-0 win and take Argentina into the final. The sides haven't met since. WV: Belgium played Argentina twice before in a World Cup. In the opening game in Spain in 1982, the then vice-European champions beat the reigning world champions 1-0, courtesy of an Erwin Vandenbergh goal that has reached legendary status in Belgium. Four years later they met in the semifinals in Mexico. Belgium saw two promising attacks ruled out for non-existent offsides before Diego Maradona did that thing he did that summer and single-handedly steered his country to a 2-0 win. The first-ever game between the two came at the Amsterdam Olympics in 1928. Argentina won 6-3. There was also a friendly in 1984 which ended in a 2-0 Argentina win. Advantage Argentina as far as history goes. What are your expectations for the rest of the tournament? SK: I really don't know, because Argentina could continue to be as stodgy as they have been so far, or they could make the necessary adjustments -- or just manage to nod in one of the numerous set pieces they keep winning early on in matches -- and open the game up, allowing them to impose their own style on proceedings again. If either of those things happen, we should see the Argentina of the qualifiers, which we caught glimpses of in their last group stage game against Nigeria. They'll be under pressure in this one, though, and also have the huge expectation of finally getting beyond the quarterfinals -- a feat they haven't managed since Italia '90, when as defending champions they were dethroned by West Germany in the final. Psychologically, there's going to be a lot of pressure. WV: It's a tough one to call. Not one of the remaining countries is significantly stronger than the rest. Belgium and Colombia were the most convincing of the second round winners and Costa Rica are the tournament's surprise package. But it would be foolish to count out Brazil, Holland, France, Germany or, for that matter, Argentina. Even if they haven't played well and were lucky to survive Switzerland, they still have the mercurial talent of Messi, who can change a game even if he only gets a few touches. But they will do well to heed Maradona's warning: they will have to play a lot better or they will be in big trouble against Belgium. Key Battle: SK: Messi vs. Vincent Kompany. In the absence of any meaningful help from his midfielders -- and given the evidence of the tournament so far, we must assume that's going to continue -- Messi will again be Argentina's team going forward, rather than just their key man. Kompany's going to get close to him, probably aided by a fellow midfielder or defender, and things will be as tight as they have been all tournament thus far, unless Argentina can finally shake off their collective lack of interest and seek to properly exploit the space that putting two men on Messi will open up elsewhere in the Belgian formation. And of course, in every one of Argentina's games so far there's been a point when, however good that shackling of Messi has been throughout, he's finally broken free and won them the game (either scoring or, as he did on Tuesday, providing the assist). Can that pattern continue here? WV: A football game is never a direct battle between a forward and a goalkeeper but here are some key statistics: Belgium are unbeaten in 21 consecutive games with Thibaut Courtois in goal. Argentina haven't lost with Messi in 24 consecutive games. And Messi hasn't scored against Courtois in seven. The great Johan Cruyff once said: "The longer a run like that goes on, the more likely it becomes that it is ended." It remains to be seen which of these runs ends on Saturday. Messi can score at will against almost any opposition but Courtois is perfectly capable of "doing a Howard". Prediction: SK: Until now Argentina's results have been easy to predict because even while playing lethargically, they've had clearly the better quality. This game is a little different. Messi's been so ruthlessly effective, though, that I think he can make the difference again. I'm going for Argentina by a goal, though very possibly not in normal time. WV: Marc Wilmots has hinted that Belgium are not the favourites for this game. "We will have to adapt to Argentina," he said. "I have a plan in my head. But then again, I wonder how Argentina will adapt to us." Belgium will do well not to change too much. The Argentinian defence is shaky at best, and Nigeria demonstrated how vulnerable they can be against high-paced football. Goalkeeper Sergio Romero doesn't exactly ooze confidence either. With six different players already on the score sheet, Belgium must take their chances from every angle. Messi may score, but Belgium will score more. 2-1 Belgium.	sports
Marcotti: Romelu Lukaku and Kevin De Bruyne are taking their second chances - ESPN FC	The nice thing about being young, talented and rich is that this game affords you second chances. You just need a bit of patience and self-belief. They'll come and then, it's up to you to take them. Romelu Lukaku and Kevin de Bruyne are the double act that sunk Jurgen Klinsmann's United States on Tuesday. They'll get a shot at doing the same to Lionel Messi's Argentina on Saturday (though Lukaku is not guaranteed to start). - Miguel Delaney: Messi vs. Courtois - Pablo Torre: Courtois can shock Argentina - John Brewin: Messi gives flagging Argentina hope - Tim Vickery: Messi aims to emulate Maradona '86 De Bruyne turned 23 last week, Lukaku 21 in May. Yet even in their brief careers they've had ups and downs worthy of Space Mountain. And, ironically, both of their dips have coincided with crossing the same guy: Jose Mourinho. Both were precocious talents who made their Belgian league debuts early. De Bruyne was 17 when he first featured for Genk. Lukaku was just 16 years and 11 days old when he came on for Anderlecht in the playoff for the Belgian league title against Standard. Lukaku and De Bruyne both struggled at Chelsea but are thriving for Belgium. Both were acquired by Chelsea for a combined fee somewhere north of $35 million; Lukaku in August 2011, De Bruyne in January 2012 (though Chelsea allowed him to finish out the season with Genk). Between them, they've been Chelsea players for five seasons. Incredibly, they've combined for just three Premier League starts (two for De Bruyne, one for Lukaku) in that time. One way or another, they simply haven't fit in at the Stamford Bridge club. Lukaku had a rough debut season -- to be fair, he was competing for playing time with Didier Drogba, Nicolas Anelka, Salomon Kalou and Fernando Torres -- and was then loaned out first to West Brom, where he notched 17 league goals, and then, this past year, to Everton where he racked up 15. Argentina vs. Belgium: July 5 (ESPN and WatchESPN) - Van Walle: Belgian belief continues to grow - Laurens: Spotlight on Divock Origi - Macintosh: Player stocks, who's rising? - 50-50 Challenge: Argentina vs. Belgium - Five Aside: Group winners roll into quarters - Summer Transfers: Belgians are talk of town De Bruyne arrived at the end of the 2011-12 campaign and was packed off almost straight away to Werder Bremen. He returned in the summer of 2013 and the season started brightly as he featured in three of Chelsea's first five league matches. Then he disappeared from the matchday squad, reappearing only long enough to be sold to Wolfsburg in January. Mourinho accused De Bruyne of not working hard enough. Lukaku also endured barbs from the Special One, who suggested in November that the Belgian striker had misled fans about his desire to stay at the club. Lukaku is still a Chelsea player, though for how much longer remains to be seen. His contract expires in 2016 and if he doesn't extend his deal -- and, frankly, why would he want to? -- he'll likely be sold or loaned out again. It's not surprising per se that two players capable of powering their country to a World Cup quarterfinal should be such marginal figures at the club that actually owned them. It is somewhat perplexing that neither got a serious look-in. (And, no, you can't blame it all on Mourinho either.) De Bruyne has been trusted to play a crucial role for Belgium and so far, he's repaid that faith. In some ways, they epitomize the state of the modern game and the issue of big clubs stockpiling talent. At times it feels as if the big boys, thanks to their enormous financial advantage, simply chuck as much as they can against the wall and see what sticks. If they mature quickly enough to have an immediate impact, then great. If not, you sell them off and because you've used your economic clout to cherry pick the best talent out there, odds are you won't make too big a loss. In fact, with these two, Chelsea are laughing all the way to their local financial institution. De Bruyne moved for $25 million -- more than twice what Chelsea paid for him. Lukaku should comfortably fetch somewhere north of $40 million (possibly considerably more) provided he either extends his contract or is sold this summer. Great business, return approaching 100 percent; a masterstroke by Chelsea. Or was it? It probably was. From the players' perspective though, you're not so sure. For De Bruyne, what must it have felt like back in December when your own manager was talking you down? Would you get a shot at the World Cup? What if the criticism was going to be enough to sink your move? Lukaku's done nothing but score goals for club and country despite failing to impress Mourinho. Same goes for Lukaku. It's great to bang in goals at Everton and West Brom but you're a Chelsea player and it's being made clear to you there is no future at Stamford Bridge for you. At least under the current regime. And -- let's be clear -- it's not as if Mourinho is doing this because he's petty or spiteful. His job is to put Chelsea in the best possible position to succeed and if he genuinely believed that these two don't fit the bill -- remember, he felt the same way about Juan Mata and David Luiz, it's not personal -- he has every right to do what he believes is best. After all, it's him on the line if things don't work out. Still, it's one thing to have your ability questioned. But when it's your work ethic or character that's under scrutiny, well... that's a lot to take on board at such a young age. Belgium has offered respite. Coach Marc Wilmots trusted De Bruyne with a role in the No. 10 hole (and, lest we forget, he has a certain Eden Hazard who can -- and has -- played that position to much acclaim while at Lille) and he has repaid that confidence. Christian Benteke's injury paved the way for Lukaku and while his first two outings were disappointing (a lingering ankle problem hasn't helped matters), you feel he's ready to regain his spot in the lineup. Second chances: if you're young enough and hungry enough, this game will offer you plenty. It's up to you to seize them and these two look to be doing just that.

First, the obligatory Luis Suarez mention. All the latest on his proposed move to Barcelona can be found here. Ashley Cole to... Roma? Spare a thought for Ashley Cole, currently unemployed and not allowed to go to Brazil for a summer holiday with his chums from England. But wait -- what's this? A move to Roma, that's what. The folks at the Daily Mail say a two-year deal is on the table for the left-back. Cole's best years are behind him but he remains a perfectly capable left-back who will have a glut of options to choose from. Of those, it appears Roma are leading the hunt. Negredo no-go, so Atleti go for Mandzukic Time for a tale that could affect a whole raft of clubs across Europe. Atletico Madrid are desperate to sign Chelsea-bound Diego Costa's replacement and had been keen on Manchester City striker Alvaro Negredo, but it appears that ship has sailed. Not to be deterred, La Liga's champions are on to their "Plan B" -- Mario Mandzukic. That's according to Marca, who label the deal "very close." That could come as a blow to Arsenal. Arsene Wenger hasn't made a signing yet but is expected -- surely -- to sign a striker, and Bayern Munich's Mandzukic was said to be an option. But Atelti are in pole position to land the Croatia international, whose move could be made official within the next few days. Wenger not made a signing? Maybe we spoke too soon While their rivals have been busy splashing the cash this summer, Wenger has kept quiet -- until now. L'Equipe believe a signing is coming in the shape of Newcastle's Mathieu Debuchy for around 10 million Euros. A smart move, in our view. Bacary Sagna has departed for Manchester City and Arsenal need a right-back with Premier League experience. A decent start to their business for the FA Cup winners -- now for that elusive striker... Evra farewell? Patrice Evra signed a new contract with Manchester United at the start of the summer, so we're going to treat La Gazzetta dello Sport's story regarding his exit with caution. The report suggests Evra wants out of Old Trafford to join Juventus on a free, but having lost the experience of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic this summer, Louis van Gaal could probably do with keeping Evra around. You'd expect Luke Shaw to be first choice at United following his big-money move, but there's bound to be time for Evra next campaign. However, a move to Juve could actually make sense if Evra was used as a makeweight. Why, you ask? Read on... Juve for Sanchez sparks domino effect Bear with us on this one, it's rather juicy. Word from Spain is that Juventus are keen to sign Barcelona's Alexis Sanchez and such a move could be music to Manchester United fans' ears -- as well as wrecking the hopes of Arsenal and Liverpool. Sanchez is said to be part of Barcelona's negotiation package for Suarez, but Arsene Wenger is eager to take the Chilean to north London. However, the pair could end up disappointed if Juventus, long term admirers of Sanchez, get their way. The Old Lady want to sign the former Udinese man and Sport says they will be able to afford Sanchez if they sell Arturo Vidal. ESPNFC recently told you that Vidal was open to a move to Old Trafford, but Juventus want the bidding to start at around 45 million euros. So, selling Vidal to United could get them Sanchez, annoying Arsenal and Liverpool in the process. Got it? Reina to remain at Liverpool To be perfectly honest, Transfer Talk completely forgot Pepe Reina was still a Liverpool player. He is, though, and is returning to Brendan Rodgers' side this summer and could yet remain there. A permanent move to Napoli has been mooted but The Liverpool Echo say the Spaniard is ready to stay at Liverpool. But with Simon Mignolet the undisputed first choice, where does that leave Reina?

FIFA to look into Brazil forward Neymar injury - ESPN FC	FIFA has told ESPN it will investigate the circumstances of the injury that has ruled Brazil forward Neymar out of the rest of the World Cup. The Barcelona player sustained a fractured vertebra in Friday's quarterfinal defeat of Colombia, and had to be stretchered off following a collision with Juan Camilo Zuniga. Referee Carlos Velasco Carballo has come under fire for his handling of a feisty game that witnessed 54 fouls, while some have expressed their anger at Zuniga's challenge. "We are awaiting the official match reports and we will gather, as well as analyse, all the necessary elements in order to evaluate the matter," a FIFA spokesperson said. Neymar was forced to return to Brazil's training camp in Teresopolis in an ambulance following the Colombia game. The 22-year-old flew back to Rio de Janeiro with the rest of his Brazil teammates on Friday but rode the rest of the way to the camp separately.

I still have not seen the pictures, but I know that in these circumstances it was difficult to get the ball off Neymar. "He was dominating.

At times it feels as if the big boys, thanks to their enormous financial advantage, simply chuck as much as they can against the wall and see what sticks. If they mature quickly enough to have an immediate impact, then great. If not, you sell them off and because you've used your economic clout to cherry pick the best talent out there, odds are you won't make too big a loss. In fact, with these two, Chelsea are laughing all the way to their local financial institution. De Bruyne moved for $25 million -- more than twice what Chelsea paid for him. Lukaku should comfortably fetch somewhere north of $40 million (possibly considerably more) provided he either extends his contract or is sold this summer. Great business, return approaching 100 percent; a masterstroke by Chelsea. Or was it? It probably was. From the players' perspective though, you're not so sure. For De Bruyne, what must it have felt like back in December when your own manager was talking you down? Would you get a shot at the World Cup? What if the criticism was going to be enough to sink your move? Lukaku's done nothing but score goals for club and country despite failing to impress Mourinho. Same goes for Lukaku. It's great to bang in goals at Everton and West Brom but you're a Chelsea player and it's being made clear to you there is no future at Stamford Bridge for you. At least under the current regime. And -- let's be clear -- it's not as if Mourinho is doing this because he's petty or spiteful. His job is to put Chelsea in the best possible position to succeed and if he genuinely believed that these two don't fit the bill -- remember, he felt the same way about Juan Mata and David Luiz, it's not personal -- he has every right to do what he believes is best. After all, it's him on the line if things don't work out. Still, it's one thing to have your ability questioned. But when it's your work ethic or character that's under scrutiny, well... that's a lot to take on board at such a young age. Belgium has offered respite. Coach Marc Wilmots trusted De Bruyne with a role in the No. 10 hole (and, lest we forget, he has a certain Eden Hazard who can -- and has -- played that position to much acclaim while at Lille) and he has repaid that confidence. Christian Benteke's injury paved the way for Lukaku and while his first two outings were disappointing (a lingering ankle problem hasn't helped matters), you feel he's ready to regain his spot in the lineup. Second chances: if you're young enough and hungry enough, this game will offer you plenty. It's up to you to seize them and these two look to be doing just that.

FIFA to look into Brazil forward Neymar injury - ESPN FC	FIFA has told ESPN it will investigate the circumstances of the injury that has ruled Brazil forward Neymar out of the rest of the World Cup. The Barcelona player sustained a fractured vertebra in Friday's quarterfinal defeat of Colombia, and had to be stretchered off following a collision with Juan Camilo Zuniga. Referee Carlos Velasco Carballo has come under fire for his handling of a feisty game that witnessed 54 fouls, while some have expressed their anger at Zuniga's challenge. "We are awaiting the official match reports and we will gather, as well as analyse, all the necessary elements in order to evaluate the matter," a FIFA spokesperson said. Neymar was forced to return to Brazil's training camp in Teresopolis in an ambulance following the Colombia game. The 22-year-old flew back to Rio de Janeiro with the rest of his Brazil teammates on Friday but rode the rest of the way to the camp separately.

World Cup referee Carlos Velasco Carballo under fire for 'poor officiating' - ESPN FC	World Cup referee Carlos Velasco Carballo has faced heavy criticism for his inability to control Brazil's quarterfinal defeat of Colombia. - Duarte: Neymar's injury hurts Brazil and World Cup - Johnson: Refs keeping cards close to their chest Friday's game saw a number of heavy tackles, with many going unpunished, while James Rodriguez seemed to be targeted by the Selecao players throughout the match. Carballo showed just four yellow cards, despite blowing for 54 fouls -- a record in this World Cup -- and the Spanish official's failure to clamp down on the indiscipline ultimately led to Juan Camilo Zuniga's challenge on Neymar, which has ruled out the Brazil forward for the rest of the tournament due to a broken vertebra. "Carballo wore the referee's kit, but he wasn't in charge for this quarterfinal in Fortaleza," former World Cup referee Graham Poll wrote in his column in the Daily Mail. "The second half of a promising game deteriorated into a petty, ugly affair in which Carballo was happy to award free kicks but nothing else -- until it was too late." Hulk said after the game that teammate Neymar needed more protection from referees after being repeatedly targeted by opponents.

The media in Brazil were equally outraged by Carballo's officiating, with Band TV's firebrand sports presenter, Milton Neves, raging: "This Spanish referee was like the Spanish team at this World Cup: a joke." Carballo made his name in La Liga for being a strict disciplinarian, while his 108 yellows card -- including 12 in one game -- handed out last season was one of the highest in the league. That the Spaniard chose to mainly keep his cards in his pocket on Friday, then, seems surprising, but he is not the first official to face accusations of leniency towards the hosts at this tournament. Yuichi Nishimura came under fire for giving the World Cup hosts a soft penalty in the opening game of the tournament against Croatia. "FIFA instructions have clearly affected a number of referees in this tournament and it is highly unlikely that will change in the remaining six games," Poll added.	sports

At £25 million Barkley would be seen as 'one for the future' while Rodwell would see his faltering career given a kick start by a return to his boyhood club according to the Daily Mirror. First, the obligatory Luis Suarez mention. All the latest on his proposed move to Barcelona can be found here. Ashley Cole to... Roma? Spare a thought for Ashley Cole, currently unemployed and not allowed to go to Brazil for a summer holiday with his chums from England. But wait -- what's this? A move to Roma, that's what. The folks at the Daily Mail say a two-year deal is on the table for the left-back. Cole's best years are behind him but he remains a perfectly capable left-back who will have a glut of options to choose from. Of those, it appears Roma are leading the hunt. Negredo no-go, so Atleti go for Mandzukic Time for a tale that could affect a whole raft of clubs across Europe. Atletico Madrid are desperate to sign Chelsea-bound Diego Costa's replacement and had been keen on Manchester City striker Alvaro Negredo, but it appears that ship has sailed. Not to be deterred, La Liga's champions are on to their "Plan B" -- Mario Mandzukic. That's according to Marca, who label the deal "very close." That could come as a blow to Arsenal. Arsene Wenger hasn't made a signing yet but is expected -- surely -- to sign a striker, and Bayern Munich's Mandzukic was said to be an option. But Atelti are in pole position to land the Croatia international, whose move could be made official within the next few days. Wenger not made a signing? Maybe we spoke too soon While their rivals have been busy splashing the cash this summer, Wenger has kept quiet -- until now. L'Equipe believe a signing is coming in the shape of Newcastle's Mathieu Debuchy for around 10 million Euros. A smart move, in our view. Bacary Sagna has departed for Manchester City and Arsenal need a right-back with Premier League experience. A decent start to their business for the FA Cup winners -- now for that elusive striker... Evra farewell? Patrice Evra signed a new contract with Manchester United at the start of the summer, so we're going to treat La Gazzetta dello Sport's story regarding his exit with caution. The report suggests Evra wants out of Old Trafford to join Juventus on a free, but having lost the experience of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic this summer, Louis van Gaal could probably do with keeping Evra around. You'd expect Luke Shaw to be first choice at United following his big-money move, but there's bound to be time for Evra next campaign. However, a move to Juve could actually make sense if Evra was used as a makeweight. Why, you ask? Read on... Juve for Sanchez sparks domino effect Bear with us on this one, it's rather juicy. Word from Spain is that Juventus are keen to sign Barcelona's Alexis Sanchez and such a move could be music to Manchester United fans' ears -- as well as wrecking the hopes of Arsenal and Liverpool. Sanchez is said to be part of Barcelona's negotiation package for Suarez, but Arsene Wenger is eager to take the Chilean to north London. However, the pair could end up disappointed if Juventus, long term admirers of Sanchez, get their way. The Old Lady want to sign the former Udinese man and Sport says they will be able to afford Sanchez if they sell Arturo Vidal. ESPNFC recently told you that Vidal was open to a move to Old Trafford, but Juventus want the bidding to start at around 45 million euros. So, selling Vidal to United could get them Sanchez, annoying Arsenal and Liverpool in the process. Got it? Reina to remain at Liverpool To be perfectly honest, Transfer Talk completely forgot Pepe Reina was still a Liverpool player. He is, though, and is returning to Brendan Rodgers' side this summer and could yet remain there. A permanent move to Napoli has been mooted but The Liverpool Echo say the Spaniard is ready to stay at Liverpool. But with Simon Mignolet the undisputed first choice, where does that leave Reina?

Paul Scholes says Real Madrid better for Luis Suarez not Barcelona - ESPN FC	Paul Scholes believes Luis Suarez would be better off joining Real Madrid than Barcelona and has raised doubts if the Uruguayan can be part of the same side as Lionel Messi. - Usher: Suarez doing himself no favours at Anfield Barcelona are in talks with Liverpool about signing their top scorer, who was named Footballer of the Year last season. But former Manchester United and England midfielder Scholes feels Suarez might not get a chance to succeed at the Camp Nou if Barcelona's record scorer Messi does not want to be part of the same side as him. Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who sometimes had to operate as a winger to accommodate Messi's position as a false nine, only spent one, unhappy season at Barcelona and Scholes thinks the Spanish club's tactics could force Suarez to adopt a wider role. LUIS SUAREZ BANNED WORLDWIDE - 'I lost my balance,' Suarez tells FIFA - FIFA bans Luis Suarez for four months - Delaney: Tabarez digs in for Suarez - Brewin: No sympathy for Luis Suarez - Thompson: Uruguay comes to Suarez defence - Marcotti: Suarez in another bite storm Scholes wrote in his Paddy Power blog: "If Luis Suarez does sign for Barcelona from Liverpool, will Lionel Messi 'accept' him? Suarez is a centre forward and he won't want to play out wide. I can't see Suarez and Messi linking well together. "It seems to me, if Messi likes you, you'll play. If he doesn't, you're wasting your time. And, to be honest, I think Suarez is making a bit of a mistake going to Barcelona: he'd be better suited to Real Madrid." Suarez, who is currently serving a four-month suspension, could form part of a front three with Messi and Neymar at Barcelona while Real pick wingers Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale either side of striker Karim Benzema.	sports

Netherlands not a great team - Louis van Gaal - ESPN FC	Despite being their coach, Louis van Gaal does not think Netherlands are a great team, but believes they can win the World Cup as they are hard to beat. - Kuper: Dutch close to realizing their dream - Pinto 'worried' about Robben diving Four years on from falling at the final hurdle to Spain in South Africa, the Oranje are preparing for a quarterfinal against surprise package Costa Rica. It is a match they enter as overwhelming favourites, with Argentina or Belgium lying in wait if they reach the semifinals. Van Gaal is confident his side will get through Saturday's clash in Salvador, but laughed off suggestions they are feeling under pressure given Costa Rica are seen as having nothing to lose. "Well, I may have some news for you -- the Dutch media did not expect that we would get this far either,'' he told his prematch news conference. "Everything we are achieving now should be fantastic for the Dutch media, but that is not the issue. The issue is our own objectives, our goal. "Our goal has always been to become world champions and we have already said we are a team which is very difficult to beat. "We're not a great team, but a team which is difficult to beat. So far we have shown that and I hope we can continue that up to and including the final. "That Costa Rica are considered to be a less strong team, that is by the media. That is not our words, we are not saying that.'' Van Gaal's suggestion that Netherlands are "not a great team" will raise some eyebrows, especially as they thrashed reigning champions Spain 5-1 in their Group B opener. The Oranje return to the scene of that triumph -- the Arena Fonte Nova -- for the Costa Rica tie. Ahead of the match, one reporter suggested that perhaps Van Gaal was guilty of underestimating his own team. "Well, perhaps, yes, you may be right,'' he said. "But we have always said since the preparation for this World Cup that it will not be the best or most fantastic team that is going to win, but the best 23 players will win this. "We all have one goal, we are all supporting each other, complementing each other. That's what the Dutch team is, all 23 players. "We've been able to achieve outstanding results and this what we see. "That will remain for the entire tournament, even if we lose. The Dutch team will fight right to the very last minute to become world champions.'' Van Gaal sat alongside injured midfielder Nigel de Jong -- who has been ruled out of the rest of the tournament -- at the prematch news conference, and the coach spoke about the importance of the elder statesman to his young side. The most important of that group is arguably captain Robin van Persie, who Van Gaal will again work with when he takes the reins at Manchester United after the World Cup. "We have four or five older players and the influence of these older players is quite substantial because we have a very young group of players,'' he said. "It is pleasant for a coach, for a trainer, to have these players that will do everything it takes, who will also look after these players in the spirit of the trainer.''	sports
Costa Rica coach Jorge Luis Pinto 'worried' about Arjen Robben diving - ESPN FC	Costa Rica coach Jorge Luis Pinto says he is "really worried" about Arjen Robben's diving and has pleaded with officials to be vigilant during the World Cup quarterfinal against Netherlands. - McIntyre: Pinto has Ticos primed for the Netherlands Los Ticos have been the surprise package in Brazil, overcoming Uruguay and Italy before holding England to a draw as they won Group D. That dream run continued in Recife on Sunday as they rode their luck against Greece to win a tense clash on penalties, setting up a quarterfinal against Netherlands. The Oranje produced a remarkable late comeback to deny Mexico in their round-of-16 encounter, after which Robben made headlines by admitting he dived in the match. The winger was insistent he had not taken a tumble for the penalty from which Klaas-Jan Huntelaar struck the winner, but his dive has concerned Pinto. "This is one of the most important questions I have been asked in this World Cup,'' Pinto said. "Diving. This is something that makes us worry a lot. We're really worried about that. "I would like to ask FIFA and the referees to watch Robben closely. We're really worried about his diving. He has admitted doing it. "I hope the referee watches him very closely tomorrow. I would like FIFA and the referee to watch out because it is very important and can have a huge influence on the result.'' Ravshan Irmatov of Uzbekistan will be taking charge of the match and Pinto hopes he is brave enough to book Robben should he dive. "That may be the most logical solution,'' he said. "Maybe he would have to leave the field because he gets two yellow cards for diving. "Why not? That could happen. I want to trust the referees. Let's see what happens.'' Robben will play a key role for Netherlands in Salvador, where Costa Rica captain Bryan Ruiz hopes his side can extend their record-breaking run. "Maybe in a few months this will all sink in, but for right now we're just trying to enjoy what we're living,'' he said. "We have nothing to lose. "We've come so far and done so much, but we want more. We want to continue on and see how far this can go.'' For Ruiz, this is a particularly special match considering he is playing against the country where he has spent so much of his professional career. The 28-year-old made his name with Twente, playing there between 2009 and 2011, before moving to Fulham. Ruiz returned to the Netherlands earlier this year after falling out of favour at Craven Cottage, impressing during a loan spell at PSV Eindhoven. "It's nice to play against a team like Netherlands, but it's difficult too,'' he told FIFA's official website. "I have so many friends in Netherlands. The place was my home for years and I care about its people. But for us it is a dream to play in the quarterfinals. "We know we're doing something so big for the people back home, but maybe we don't realise the extent of how big just yet.''	sports

"This is one of the most important questions I have been asked in this World Cup,'' Pinto said. "Diving. This is something that makes us worry a lot. We're really worried about that. "I would like to ask FIFA and the referees to watch Robben closely. We're really worried about his diving. He has admitted doing it. "I hope the referee watches him very closely tomorrow. I would like FIFA and the referee to watch out because it is very important and can have a huge influence on the result.'' Ravshan Irmatov of Uzbekistan will be taking charge of the match and Pinto hopes he is brave enough to book Robben should he dive. "That may be the most logical solution,'' he said. "Maybe he would have to leave the field because he gets two yellow cards for diving. "Why not? That could happen. I want to trust the referees. Let's see what happens.'' Robben will play a key role for Netherlands in Salvador, where Costa Rica captain Bryan Ruiz hopes his side can extend their record-breaking run. "Maybe in a few months this will all sink in, but for right now we're just trying to enjoy what we're living,'' he said. "We have nothing to lose. "We've come so far and done so much, but we want more. We want to continue on and see how far this can go.'' For Ruiz, this is a particularly special match considering he is playing against the country where he has spent so much of his professional career. The 28-year-old made his name with Twente, playing there between 2009 and 2011, before moving to Fulham. Ruiz returned to the Netherlands earlier this year after falling out of favour at Craven Cottage, impressing during a loan spell at PSV Eindhoven. "It's nice to play against a team like Netherlands, but it's difficult too,'' he told FIFA's official website. "I have so many friends in Netherlands. The place was my home for years and I care about its people. But for us it is a dream to play in the quarterfinals. "We know we're doing something so big for the people back home, but maybe we don't realise the extent of how big just yet.''	sports
Netherlands not a great team - Louis van Gaal - ESPN FC	Despite being their coach, Louis van Gaal does not think Netherlands are a great team, but believes they can win the World Cup as they are hard to beat. - Kuper: Dutch close to realizing their dream - Pinto 'worried' about Robben diving Four years on from falling at the final hurdle to Spain in South Africa, the Oranje are preparing for a quarterfinal against surprise package Costa Rica. It is a match they enter as overwhelming favourites, with Argentina or Belgium lying in wait if they reach the semifinals. Van Gaal is confident his side will get through Saturday's clash in Salvador, but laughed off suggestions they are feeling under pressure given Costa Rica are seen as having nothing to lose. "Well, I may have some news for you -- the Dutch media did not expect that we would get this far either,'' he told his prematch news conference. "Everything we are achieving now should be fantastic for the Dutch media, but that is not the issue. The issue is our own objectives, our goal. "Our goal has always been to become world champions and we have already said we are a team which is very difficult to beat. "We're not a great team, but a team which is difficult to beat. So far we have shown that and I hope we can continue that up to and including the final. "That Costa Rica are considered to be a less strong team, that is by the media. That is not our words, we are not saying that.'' Van Gaal's suggestion that Netherlands are "not a great team" will raise some eyebrows, especially as they thrashed reigning champions Spain 5-1 in their Group B opener. The Oranje return to the scene of that triumph -- the Arena Fonte Nova -- for the Costa Rica tie. Ahead of the match, one reporter suggested that perhaps Van Gaal was guilty of underestimating his own team. "Well, perhaps, yes, you may be right,'' he said. "But we have always said since the preparation for this World Cup that it will not be the best or most fantastic team that is going to win, but the best 23 players will win this. "We all have one goal, we are all supporting each other, complementing each other. That's what the Dutch team is, all 23 players. "We've been able to achieve outstanding results and this what we see. "That will remain for the entire tournament, even if we lose. The Dutch team will fight right to the very last minute to become world champions.'' Van Gaal sat alongside injured midfielder Nigel de Jong -- who has been ruled out of the rest of the tournament -- at the prematch news conference, and the coach spoke about the importance of the elder statesman to his young side. The most important of that group is arguably captain Robin van Persie, who Van Gaal will again work with when he takes the reins at Manchester United after the World Cup.

Neymar's injury doesn't just hurt Brazil but the World Cup, too - ESPN FC	FORTALEZA, Brazil -- Hindsight can make anything seem fatalistic, but it is impossible not to think back just a couple of days. In an attempt to bring calm to a turbulent week of preparations for the quarterfinal versus Colombia, the Brazilian Football Confederation press department unveiled Neymar for a news conference in their Teresopolis training camp. It was manna from heaven for over 300 journalists from all over the planet, and he didn't let people down, especially when playing down the pressure to perform by saying he was having the time of his life. "I have dreamed for 12 years of the chance to play in a World Cup for Brazil, and now that I am, why should I be afraid instead of enjoying it?" he asked. Neymar's injury has ruined what has been a superb debut World Cup for the young Brazilian star. Thanks to a seemingly cowardly challenge by Juan Camillo Zuñiga, Neymar's dream was ended Friday night on the Castelao pitch. Floored after being whacked on the back by the Colombian defender's right knee, the Barcelona forward suffered a broken vertebra; although it is not career threatening, the injury is bad enough to keep him out of the tournament on which the Brazilian desperately wanted to leave his mark. It will surely be heartbreaking news for every Brazilian remotely interested in football, but nobody else will be as down and out as the 22-year-old. Fearless on the pitch, he had been more than Brazil's top scorer in the tournament and their biggest hero since 2010. He was their hope of doing the unexpected in edging the Seleção ahead of the competition. It's true that Lionel Messi has delivered much more regularly for Argentina in this World Cup, literally bailing out the Albiceleste in every single one of their four games so far. But Messi is the owner of four Ballon d'Or trophies and was never under the same pressure to deliver when he debuted for Argentina in Germany 2006. Neymar, on the other hand, is making his World Cup debut at home and was singled out as the player to lead by example. That he didn't freak out and hide was already remarkable; to have hit the ground running from Game 1 as he did is the stuff of dreams.

Surrounded by teammates with much more mileage and experience, he looked much older and wiser with the Selecao. When striker Fred said in an interview that the team were ready to "throw the ball to him and expect great things," it was no joke. This kid has been such a breath of fresh air in Brazilian football that public opinion demanded his inclusion in Brazil's 2010 World Cup squad only for then-manager Dunga to rule it out. Ironically, Neymar popped up every once in a while in South African stadiums thanks to his TV commercial for one of the tournament sponsors, who aired a piece in which the teenager juggled a football alongside Santos FC teammate Robinho, who was actually a Seleção player in that World Cup. Smiling and frequently attempting some outrageous dribble, the striker quickly formed a substantial fan club, helped by a scoring tally that would automatically be compared to what a younger Pele had been doing in his early days. Neymar would finish the 2010 season with 43 goals, but had already won the status of "next big thing" by then. Pelé himself even decided to butt in and ask Dunga to consider recruiting the boy. After Brazil's quarterfinal exit in which the lack of inspiration upfront was more shocking then their breakdown against the Netherlands, Neymar's arrival was just a matter of time, and incoming manager Mano Menezes didn't even blink. Debuting and scoring in a 2-0 win over the U.S., Neymar became the Seleção's top scorer, and Brazilians enthused for him in a way that hadn't been seen since Ronaldinho. It's imperative that Brazil rally behind their injured star versus Germany and don't let his absence be in vain. From a marketing standpoint, he was also piping hot. There were moments of doubt and criticism, but by the time the 2014 World Cup started, the Seleção was Neymar plus 10 others on the pitch for Brazilians and whoever else was watching the team. While some colleagues clearly looked rattled by the responsibility of playing a World Cup at home and by the task of redeeming Brazil from their shame of 1950, Neymar really looked at home and at ease, even though he did shed a tear or two while singing the national anthem in their opening game against Croatia in São Paulo. Then, when he walked toward the penalty spot to take a kick against Chile after Hulk and Willian had missed, he knew it was a date with destiny. Coolly wrong-footing the keeper, Neymar looked ready to follow the footsteps of his idol Ronaldo, whose success in 2002 inspired him even to copy the horrendous haircut the former Inter Milan and Barcelona player wore in that tournament. These days in Brazil, kids from all walks of life imitate Neymar. In a recent Dutch practice session in Rio, one of Dirk Kuyt's kids scored a goal in a kickabout and celebrated by shouting "Neymar." Neymar's absence is a huge blow to Brazil's hope of lifting a sixth World Cup title. There is no point in comparing this situation with Pele's injury in 1962 because that tournament was contested by a Seleção that not only boasted the likes of Garrincha and Didi, they were also peppered with veterans from Brazil's successful 1958 campaign. Now the Seleção face Germany in the semifinal on Tuesday having to deal with the biggest nightmare scenario one could have imagined for the hosts before the World Cup began. It is not an understatement to say Brazilians will wake up on Saturday feeling quite deflated; even German fans might agree that the tournament lost a lot of its charm with the departure of yet another major protagonist. The Seleção, however, will have to answer the question about what they could do having lost their biggest star. Given that he helped them get that far in the competition, his teammates owe him a display of courage. They need to leave their hearts and souls on the pitch in Belo Horizonte in a couple of days, while supporters will be more crucial than even in spurring the team forward. Neymar deserves that so that his sacrifice won't be in vain.

Costa Rica coach Jorge Luis Pinto 'worried' about Arjen Robben diving - ESPN FC	Costa Rica coach Jorge Luis Pinto says he is "really worried" about Arjen Robben's diving and has pleaded with officials to be vigilant during the World Cup quarterfinal against Netherlands. - McIntyre: Pinto has Ticos primed for the Netherlands Los Ticos have been the surprise package in Brazil, overcoming Uruguay and Italy before holding England to a draw as they won Group D.

Germany France quarterfinal review - ESPN FC	Bastian Schweinsteiger celebrates Germany's passage to the semifinals for a record fourth World Cup in a row. Rio de Janeiro. Wolfgang Niersbach had a straightforward explanation for Germany's 1-0 win over France at the Maracana. "More important than any (tactical) set-up is the mindset," the German FA chairman insisted after Joachim Low's team had secured a fourth consecutive semifinal appearance at a World Cup. Most observers will baulk at such a simplistic assessment. But Thomas Muller, a player who can come up with interesting answers to even the most banal questions, took the same line. Quizzed about Germany's solid defensive game, the 24-year-old didn't discuss the national manager reverting back to the Schweinsteiger-Khedira partnership in the middle, Low's preference for Jerome Boateng over Per Mertesacker at the heart of the defence or the much-vaunted decision to put Philipp Lahm back into his customary right-back role. Instead, Muller said the key had been his team's "good mentality." - Jones: The match that failed to fire - Delaney: France run out of steam - Marcotti: Germany back in old routine "Everybody made the runs that are necessary to be in the right position defensively," he explained. "That's maybe something that is often missing in qualifiers and friendlies, because you don't toil as much when there's less at stake. But under pressure, we are extremely strong in the head. As long as we all fight this well, we will be very hard to beat." If Muller and Niersbach are right, this shines a new light on the team's struggles for defensive assuredness over the last couple of years (as well as in the games against Ghana and Algeria at this World Cup). Forget the Schweini-Khedira conundrum (and Low's solution -- Lahm's midfield role); forget the absence of the Bender twins; forget the high defensive line. The real flaw, Muller and Niersbach seemed to suggest, wasn't so much in Germany's tactical blueprint but the team's willingness or lack thereof to go the extra mile in its implementation. You'd expect this kind of assessment from a work-horse like Muller, who had once again been an indefatigable runner in subtropical conditions. "It felt like playing in a grill shack today," he joked. "But you don't contest a World Cup quarterfinal every day. One should use the opportunity to get a bit of exercise." The stats bear him out. Germany ran a combined 7.5 km more than the French despite being in front for 78 minutes and restricting themselves to sporadic attacks in the second half. You could say that Germany ran so much, the fact that Schweinsteiger and Khedira were underwhelming didn't matter. Mats Hummels' header from Toni Kroos free-kick is proof that Germany's decision to practise set-plays is paying off. The former won only one of six duels, the latter two of eight -- poor returns for defensive midfielders. Those numbers belie the most important aspect of their task on Friday, however. By simply occupying the decisive space on the pitch, they forced Les Bleus to play long balls over the top, back or sideways or to lose the ball in vain efforts to power through that congested middle. When you defend this disciplined and in numbers -- Schweinsteiger and Khedira were both able to sit in the second half because France were chasing the lead -- you don't need a defensive midfield specialist. Oliver Bierhoff, one of only three members of the delegation who have been part of a trophy-winning team (the others are goalkeeping coach Andreas Kopke who, like Bierhoff, won Euro 96, and team doctor Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt) recognised the pressure game against the French had brought the best, traditional traits out of the players. "We were very organised and filled in each for each other," said the general manager. "That has been always the strength of German teams." Those so-called German virtues had become a bit of dirty word during the Klinsmann/Low era but they have now made a comeback at a very opportune time, along with the extremely useful ability to score from dead balls. Low used to almost sneer at practising them. He was more concerned with using the time to implement his passing game. The 54-year-old has changed his mind though. "We have practised them more than in the past, and the players appreciate it," said Bierhoff. "They know how important these situations can be." Indeed. Mats Hummels' goal had come from Toni Kroos' free-kick. It's all part of a return back of the basics ("the most crucial bit is knowing how to see out a game," said Muller) but without abandoning the progress of the last few years. "Compared to 2010, we are much less reliant on the counter-attack, we have many more options and ways to play in attack," Müller added, "we can still improve in that respect." Germany had also found a new maturity, said Bierhoff. "We have many players who have won the Champions League. They know what needs to be done, they know how stay calm before and during important matches." The complete absence of euphoria after the France game in the bowels of the Maracana told its own story in that regard. The 2006 and 2010 teams had been incredibly pleased to get to the semifinals. The current crop aim much higher. No, they're not a "Ubermannschaft" -- "we haven't seen any yet," said Bierhoff -- but against France, they at last looked like a team that was coming of age, a team comfortable with themselves. And that might just be enough in this year's competition. Raphael Honigstein Raphael Honigstein is ESPN FC's German football expert and a regular guest on ESPN FC TV.

Ironically, Neymar popped up every once in a while in South African stadiums thanks to his TV commercial for one of the tournament sponsors, who aired a piece in which the teenager juggled a football alongside Santos FC teammate Robinho, who was actually a Seleção player in that World Cup. Smiling and frequently attempting some outrageous dribble, the striker quickly formed a substantial fan club, helped by a scoring tally that would automatically be compared to what a younger Pele had been doing in his early days. Neymar would finish the 2010 season with 43 goals, but had already won the status of "next big thing" by then. Pelé himself even decided to butt in and ask Dunga to consider recruiting the boy. After Brazil's quarterfinal exit in which the lack of inspiration upfront was more shocking then their breakdown against the Netherlands, Neymar's arrival was just a matter of time, and incoming manager Mano Menezes didn't even blink. Debuting and scoring in a 2-0 win over the U.S., Neymar became the Seleção's top scorer, and Brazilians enthused for him in a way that hadn't been seen since Ronaldinho. It's imperative that Brazil rally behind their injured star versus Germany and don't let his absence be in vain. From a marketing standpoint, he was also piping hot. There were moments of doubt and criticism, but by the time the 2014 World Cup started, the Seleção was Neymar plus 10 others on the pitch for Brazilians and whoever else was watching the team. While some colleagues clearly looked rattled by the responsibility of playing a World Cup at home and by the task of redeeming Brazil from their shame of 1950, Neymar really looked at home and at ease, even though he did shed a tear or two while singing the national anthem in their opening game against Croatia in São Paulo. Then, when he walked toward the penalty spot to take a kick against Chile after Hulk and Willian had missed, he knew it was a date with destiny. Coolly wrong-footing the keeper, Neymar looked ready to follow the footsteps of his idol Ronaldo, whose success in 2002 inspired him even to copy the horrendous haircut the former Inter Milan and Barcelona player wore in that tournament. These days in Brazil, kids from all walks of life imitate Neymar. In a recent Dutch practice session in Rio, one of Dirk Kuyt's kids scored a goal in a kickabout and celebrated by shouting "Neymar." Neymar's absence is a huge blow to Brazil's hope of lifting a sixth World Cup title. There is no point in comparing this situation with Pele's injury in 1962 because that tournament was contested by a Seleção that not only boasted the likes of Garrincha and Didi, they were also peppered with veterans from Brazil's successful 1958 campaign. Now the Seleção face Germany in the semifinal on Tuesday having to deal with the biggest nightmare scenario one could have imagined for the hosts before the World Cup began. It is not an understatement to say Brazilians will wake up on Saturday feeling quite deflated; even German fans might agree that the tournament lost a lot of its charm with the departure of yet another major protagonist. The Seleção, however, will have to answer the question about what they could do having lost their biggest star. Given that he helped them get that far in the competition, his teammates owe him a display of courage. They need to leave their hearts and souls on the pitch in Belo Horizonte in a couple of days, while supporters will be more crucial than even in spurring the team forward. Neymar deserves that so that his sacrifice won't be in vain.

Germany France quarterfinal review - ESPN FC	Bastian Schweinsteiger celebrates Germany's passage to the semifinals for a record fourth World Cup in a row. Rio de Janeiro. Wolfgang Niersbach had a straightforward explanation for Germany's 1-0 win over France at the Maracana. "More important than any (tactical) set-up is the mindset," the German FA chairman insisted after Joachim Low's team had secured a fourth consecutive semifinal appearance at a World Cup. Most observers will baulk at such a simplistic assessment. But Thomas Muller, a player who can come up with interesting answers to even the most banal questions, took the same line. Quizzed about Germany's solid defensive game, the 24-year-old didn't discuss the national manager reverting back to the Schweinsteiger-Khedira partnership in the middle, Low's preference for Jerome Boateng over Per Mertesacker at the heart of the defence or the much-vaunted decision to put Philipp Lahm back into his customary right-back role. Instead, Muller said the key had been his team's "good mentality." - Jones: The match that failed to fire - Delaney: France run out of steam - Marcotti: Germany back in old routine "Everybody made the runs that are necessary to be in the right position defensively," he explained. "That's maybe something that is often missing in qualifiers and friendlies, because you don't toil as much when there's less at stake. But under pressure, we are extremely strong in the head. As long as we all fight this well, we will be very hard to beat." If Muller and Niersbach are right, this shines a new light on the team's struggles for defensive assuredness over the last couple of years (as well as in the games against Ghana and Algeria at this World Cup). Forget the Schweini-Khedira conundrum (and Low's solution -- Lahm's midfield role); forget the absence of the Bender twins; forget the high defensive line. The real flaw, Muller and Niersbach seemed to suggest, wasn't so much in Germany's tactical blueprint but the team's willingness or lack thereof to go the extra mile in its implementation. You'd expect this kind of assessment from a work-horse like Muller, who had once again been an indefatigable runner in subtropical conditions. "It felt like playing in a grill shack today," he joked. "But you don't contest a World Cup quarterfinal every day. One should use the opportunity to get a bit of exercise." The stats bear him out. Germany ran a combined 7.5 km more than the French despite being in front for 78 minutes and restricting themselves to sporadic attacks in the second half. You could say that Germany ran so much, the fact that Schweinsteiger and Khedira were underwhelming didn't matter. Mats Hummels' header from Toni Kroos free-kick is proof that Germany's decision to practise set-plays is paying off. The former won only one of six duels, the latter two of eight -- poor returns for defensive midfielders. Those numbers belie the most important aspect of their task on Friday, however. By simply occupying the decisive space on the pitch, they forced Les Bleus to play long balls over the top, back or sideways or to lose the ball in vain efforts to power through that congested middle. When you defend this disciplined and in numbers -- Schweinsteiger and Khedira were both able to sit in the second half because France were chasing the lead -- you don't need a defensive midfield specialist. Oliver Bierhoff, one of only three members of the delegation who have been part of a trophy-winning team (the others are goalkeeping coach Andreas Kopke who, like Bierhoff, won Euro 96, and team doctor Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt) recognised the pressure game against the French had brought the best, traditional traits out of the players. "We were very organised and filled in each for each other," said the general manager. "That has been always the strength of German teams." Those so-called German virtues had become a bit of dirty word during the Klinsmann/Low era but they have now made a comeback at a very opportune time, along with the extremely useful ability to score from dead balls. Low used to almost sneer at practising them. He was more concerned with using the time to implement his passing game. The 54-year-old has changed his mind though. "We have practised them more than in the past, and the players appreciate it," said Bierhoff. "They know how important these situations can be." Indeed. Mats Hummels' goal had come from Toni Kroos' free-kick. It's all part of a return back of the basics ("the most crucial bit is knowing how to see out a game," said Muller) but without abandoning the progress of the last few years. "Compared to 2010, we are much less reliant on the counter-attack, we have many more options and ways to play in attack," Müller added, "we can still improve in that respect." Germany had also found a new maturity, said Bierhoff. "We have many players who have won the Champions League. They know what needs to be done, they know how stay calm before and during important matches." The complete absence of euphoria after the France game in the bowels of the Maracana told its own story in that regard. The 2006 and 2010 teams had been incredibly pleased to get to the semifinals. The current crop aim much higher. No, they're not a "Ubermannschaft" -- "we haven't seen any yet," said Bierhoff -- but against France, they at last looked like a team that was coming of age, a team comfortable with themselves. And that might just be enough in this year's competition. Raphael Honigstein Raphael Honigstein is ESPN FC's German football expert and a regular guest on ESPN FC TV.

First, the obligatory Luis Suarez mention. All the latest on his proposed move to Barcelona can be found here. Ashley Cole to... Roma? Spare a thought for Ashley Cole, currently unemployed and not allowed to go to Brazil for a summer holiday with his chums from England. But wait -- what's this? A move to Roma, that's what. The folks at the Daily Mail say a two-year deal is on the table for the left-back. Cole's best years are behind him but he remains a perfectly capable left-back who will have a glut of options to choose from. Of those, it appears Roma are leading the hunt. Negredo no-go, so Atleti go for Mandzukic Time for a tale that could affect a whole raft of clubs across Europe. Atletico Madrid are desperate to sign Chelsea-bound Diego Costa's replacement and had been keen on Manchester City striker Alvaro Negredo, but it appears that ship has sailed. Not to be deterred, La Liga's champions are on to their "Plan B" -- Mario Mandzukic. That's according to Marca, who label the deal "very close." That could come as a blow to Arsenal. Arsene Wenger hasn't made a signing yet but is expected -- surely -- to sign a striker, and Bayern Munich's Mandzukic was said to be an option. But Atelti are in pole position to land the Croatia international, whose move could be made official within the next few days. Wenger not made a signing? Maybe we spoke too soon While their rivals have been busy splashing the cash this summer, Wenger has kept quiet -- until now. L'Equipe believe a signing is coming in the shape of Newcastle's Mathieu Debuchy for around 10 million Euros. A smart move, in our view. Bacary Sagna has departed for Manchester City and Arsenal need a right-back with Premier League experience. A decent start to their business for the FA Cup winners -- now for that elusive striker... Evra farewell? Patrice Evra signed a new contract with Manchester United at the start of the summer, so we're going to treat La Gazzetta dello Sport's story regarding his exit with caution. The report suggests Evra wants out of Old Trafford to join Juventus on a free, but having lost the experience of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic this summer, Louis van Gaal could probably do with keeping Evra around. You'd expect Luke Shaw to be first choice at United following his big-money move, but there's bound to be time for Evra next campaign. However, a move to Juve could actually make sense if Evra was used as a makeweight. Why, you ask? Read on... Juve for Sanchez sparks domino effect Bear with us on this one, it's rather juicy. Word from Spain is that Juventus are keen to sign Barcelona's Alexis Sanchez and such a move could be music to Manchester United fans' ears -- as well as wrecking the hopes of Arsenal and Liverpool. Sanchez is said to be part of Barcelona's negotiation package for Suarez, but Arsene Wenger is eager to take the Chilean to north London. However, the pair could end up disappointed if Juventus, long term admirers of Sanchez, get their way. The Old Lady want to sign the former Udinese man and Sport says they will be able to afford Sanchez if they sell Arturo Vidal. ESPNFC recently told you that Vidal was open to a move to Old Trafford, but Juventus want the bidding to start at around 45 million euros. So, selling Vidal to United could get them Sanchez, annoying Arsenal and Liverpool in the process. Got it? Reina to remain at Liverpool To be perfectly honest, Transfer Talk completely forgot Pepe Reina was still a Liverpool player. He is, though, and is returning to Brendan Rodgers' side this summer and could yet remain there. A permanent move to Napoli has been mooted but The Liverpool Echo say the Spaniard is ready to stay at Liverpool. But with Simon Mignolet the undisputed first choice, where does that leave Reina?

Loss of Neymar overshadows Brazil's win - ESPN FC	Brazil are through to the semifinals of the World Cup, but Neymar will not be joining them. Instead, he'll be strapped up and left to watch on television as his fractured vertebra slowly heals. That he will languish indoors rather than light up the pitch is directly the fault of Juan Zuniga, who crashed into him with a knee raised and an arm outstretched, more intent on battering the Brazilian than winning an unwinnable ball. It was a roughhouse challenge, designed to intimidate, and it has robbed the World Cup of one of its biggest stars. That, indirectly, is the fault of referee Carlos Velasco Carballo. Criticising officials for missing or misreading individual events is always mean-spirited. Referees have one real-time chance to quickly rule on incidents that tend to divide pundits even after a series of slow-motion replays. But criticising officials for the way in which they manage the game is entirely fair, especially when they do it as poorly as Carballo did. This game had 54 fouls, the most of any World Cup match this summer. To wait more than an hour to issue the first of just four bookings sent a clear message to the players: "Do what you want, lads. Just pretend I'm not here." There were countless occasions for Carballo to lay down the law and try to calm people, but he eschewed all of them for the 64 minutes before he decided Thiago Silva's attempt to block the punt of goalkeeper David Ospina was more serious than the repeated and increasingly dangerous physical fouls by players from both teams. Three minutes later, another name went in the book, but this time it was James Rodriguez, cautioned for a late slide that he knew he'd mistimed and from which he actually tried to extricate himself. Rodriguez, by this point, had already been kicked in the air numerous times without seeing any of his tormentors cautioned. When the card came out for him, he could only laugh in Carballo's face. But no one was laughing when Neymar was felled; anyone who's ever taken a knee in the back like that will know how painful it is, even if nothing is fractured. Brazil themselves had been fouling Rodriguez and Juan Cuadrado all night -- six times each, in fact. The game became an ugly, self-defeating arms race that a decent referee would have snuffed out in the first half before it got out of hand. Neymar's injury occurred late in Brazil's rambunctious encounter with Colombia. You don't expect referees to get every decision right, but you do expect them to run games in a manner that ensures the safety of the players. Carballo failed, and Brazil paid a heavy price. This blog would never get up and stand in the way of the invention and vision of better, braver men than its writer -- especially not when the sofa is this comfortable -- but Joachim Low has been a little too clever for his own good of late. Centre-backs as full-backs, full-backs as midfielders, midfielders as strikers. It's daring, certainly; impetuous, indeed -- but it's not particularly effective. Low's decision to move Philipp Lahm, the world's best right-back, to right-back seemed to finally give Germany the balance they needed, and he was rewarded with a 1-0 win over France. Miroslav Klose, a centre-forward, played up front. Thomas Muller, a midfielder, played in midfield. It was all a bit disconcertingly mainstream, like Arcade Fire suddenly releasing an album of cheesy Christmas classics. But it worked (and Arcade Fire can have that idea for free). Admittedly, Germany were aided and abetted by a French display that lacked composure at both ends and character in the middle, suffered from repeated individual errors, and lacked urgency and intensity throughout. But that aside, it was fine. Didier Deschamps lamented a lack of tournament experience, which was a fair point, though you wonder how much experience a footballer needs to remember to play well in important games. Germany, however, couldn't care less. Despite the effects of a flu bug that ravaged the squad this week, they have reached the last four of a tournament for the fifth successive time. Low might not have won anything yet, but he has consistently put Germany in a position in which they could, something that would have seemed absurdly positive after Germany's abysmal showing at Euro 2004. Seriously, what was that on James Rodriguez's arm? Don't say it was a grasshopper because grasshoppers are about the size of a crayon -- they don't cover the entirety of a grown man's upper arm, and they certainly don't look as if they're latched on with hooks and are happily draining the human of his nutrients. If that thing was a grasshopper, it was the Optimus Prime of grasshoppers. James Rodriguez and his green friend. Frankly, we're amazed Rodriguez didn't take one look, scream and then chop his own arm off just to get away from it. Jealously reading the excellent dispatches of its colleagues, this blog has occasionally wished it too were based in Brazil for the summer. Not anymore. Not if Brazil is full of those things.

German media laments Brazil star Neymar injury - ESPN FC	The German media has bemoaned the loss of one of the big stars of the 2014 World Cup, following Neymar's injury in the final minutes of the quarterfinal between Brazil and Colombia. On Tuesday, Germany and Brazil will play the first semifinal of the 2014 World Cup. It will be only the second meeting between the two nations at the highest international level, with the Selecao winning the first clash 2-0 in the 2002 World Cup final. Yet, hosts Brazil will not be able to field their best side against Die Nationalmannschaft. Captain Thiago Silva misses the match after his second booking of the tournament, and Neymar suffered a broken vertebra following a late collision with Colombia's Juan Camilo Zuniga. "The Neymar drama," read a headline on German weekly Die Zeit's website. "Neymar's loss is similar to Germany losing [Manuel] Neuer, [Phillipp] Lahm, [Mats] Hummels, [Jerome] Boateng, [Benedikt] Howedes, [Bastian] Schweinsteiger, [Sami] Khedira, [Toni] Kroos, [Mesut] Ozil, [Thomas] Muller, and [Miroslav) Klose," the paper commented. "Neymar's injury is even more tragic because this lad is not one of the so-called Uberstars, who might be on every advertising pillars, but whose best World Cup performances are at the beach. This World Cup could indeed have been Neymar's World Cup." Neymar out of the World Cup - Neymar suffers fractured vertebra - Video (U.S. only): Neymar carried off - Duarte: The World Cup's crushing loss - World Cup Tonight: How will Brazil cope?  - Lang: Five players who must step up - Neymar injury dampens celebration - Scolari to examine lineup options - Duarte: Gritty Brazil reach the last four But Die Zeit warned that Neymar's loss has also taken most of the pressure away from Brazil. They might not have the best team in footballing terms, "but they have heart and passion for 10 teams. This could be the message for the semifinal. We might not play nice, but will have even more passion now." Der Spiegel headlined "Brazil's nightmare," and said that Brazil "will not be able to replace Neymar" and added: "Neymar's injury is the biggest interference factor at this World Cup so far. Scolari and his team now have four days to think about a plan how to cope with it. At least it can't get any worse with the exception of missing the World Cup title, of course." German tactical analyst Tobias Escher believes that the absence of Neymar and Thiago Silva, the two Brazilian "focus players," will change Brazil's match plan. "Without Neymar, Brazil need a totally new attacking plan, and will also not be able to play that extreme pressing without Silva protection," Escher wrote in his column for Die Welt. "Brazil's expensive victory: Silva suspended, Neymar injured," the weekly Sport Bild headlined, and Bild ran a story on the world bemoaning the Barcelona player's injury, in which the newspaper hit out at the Spanish referee Carlos Velasco Carballo for "not protecting Neymar." This sentiment was echoed by former Germany international Mehmet Scholl, who currently works as a pundit at the World Cup for the German TV network ARD. "When referees are no longer capable of stopping brutal fouls than a player like a Neymar gets stretchered off the pitch," Scholl said. "It's like gladiators fighting" "Brazil shocked," summarised Sueddeutsche Zeitung, and heard a "sudden silence in a loud night."	sports

Young: Brazilian media's Neymar reaction - ESPN FC	BRASILIA, Brazil -- Following the news that Neymar will miss the rest of the World Cup due to a fractured vertebra, the mood among some parts of the Brazilian media was one of anger. "It was malicious... a deliberate attack on football and art," said legendary sports broadcaster Galvão Bueno on Globo, Brazil's biggest network. Much of the outrage was directed towards the leniency of Spanish referee Carlos Velasco Carballo. "This Spanish referee was like the Spanish team at this World Cup: a joke," raged terrestrial channel Band TV's firebrand sports presenter, Milton Neves. Sports coverage on Brazil's cable channels tends to be a little more measured, however, and on SporTV, Brazil's 1970 World Cup winner Carlos Alberto Torres had his doubts over Colombian defender Juan Zuniga's intent. "For me, it was an accident. He tried to break up the play. It's the kind of challenge you see all the time," Torres said. Fabio Cannavaro, a World Cup winner with Italy in 2006, speaking on the same channel, was less convinced. "I'm a little more cynical," he said. "Neymar isn't transparent. He came from behind with his knee up." ESPN's Antero Greco agreed with Carlos Alberto. "So now we've found the villain of the World Cup. The game was violent on both sides. Even [Luiz Felipe] Scolari admitted it. Any other interpretation is hysteria," he tweeted. Agora encontraram o vilão da Copa. Pô, o jogo estava pegado, o pau comendo pros dois lados. Até o Felipão admitiu. O resto é histerismo. - Antero Greco (@anterogreco) July 5, 2014 His colleague Mauro Cesar felt the same: "The Colombian player's challenge was strong, but demonising Zuniga is taking it too far. Strong tackles and injuries happen. All we can do is support Neymar." Journalists and celebrities were also busy expressing their condolences, and wrath, on Twitter. The most high profile was Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff. "Like all Brazilians, I'm united with Neymar! #StrengthNeymar", she tweeted.

"So your dreams won't come true this time!!

But Neymar is only one player, and he isn't Messi, much less Pelé. And without Pelé, we won the World Cup in 1962." Joguem por ele. Nossa capa de amanhã. Mande seu apoio para a Seleção.

Brazil in semifinals thanks to odd couple of Thiago Silva and David Luiz - ESPN FC	FORTALEZA, Brazil -- On a day when Brazil lost star midfielder Neymar for the rest of the World Cup with a fractured vertebra, the Selecao turned to their odd couple -- defenders Thiago Silva and David Luiz -- to pull them through. The two leaders in the back scored goals either side of halftime to propel Brazil to a 2-1 quarterfinal victory over Colombia. Silva latched onto a Neymar's corner kick and deflected the ball home with his knee with the game less than seven minutes old. In the 69th minute, Luiz hit a scorching 34-yard free kick past Colombia goalkeeper David Ospina. It was difficult to tell what possessed more maniacal ferocity -- the shot, or his celebratory run to the near side corner flag. "Everyone knows I train a lot on this every day," said Luiz in the post-match mixed zone. "Today I hit the ball in exactly the [right] point. So when I saw the ball, it moved a lot and it was difficult for the goalkeeper. I was happy with this." Luiz then spared a thought for Neymar, who was kneed in the back in the 86th minute by Colombia defender Juan Zuniga. The Brazilian No. 10 had to be stretchered off, and afterward Brazil team doctor Rodrigo Lasmar announced that the player had suffered a fractured lumbar vertebra that will keep him out 2-3 weeks. Neymar's World Cup is over, muting much of the feel-good factor that existed at having reached the semifinals. "I'm so happy, we're in the semifinal round of the World Cup," said Luiz. "We've dreamed about this. But I'm a little bit sad that Neymar is out of the competition. He's a great guy, great person, great player, who brings great things for football. Now he's going to be out, and everyone feels a bit sad. He's like my brother." It was a night where in addition to the goals, Silva and Luiz did their bit on the defensive end as well, cutting out numerous through balls from Colombian danger man James Rodriguez. The Colombian No. 10 finally did unlock Brazil's defense in the 78th minute, releasing substitute Carlos Bacca, who was felled by goalkeeper Julio Cesar. Rodriguez dispatched the resulting penalty to take his tournament tally to six, but for the rest of the night, Silva and Luiz -- with the help of Fernandinho who benefited form some lenient refereeing -- managed to help keep Brazil's net clean. Brazil's odd couple pairing of Thiago Silva and David Luiz will be split up in the semifinal as Silva serves a suspension. Silva and Luiz make for an odd pairing in the back, given the differences in their respective personalities. Silva cuts a commanding presence, but is very religious and soft spoken. Luiz projects a different kind of charisma, like a big kid, often taking selfies after big wins. When Brazil entered the field for the pregame warm-up, the differences were evident again. Silva was all business while Luiz sprinted out with his arms raised, signaling a No. 1 with each index finger. But as ESPN colleague Paulo Cobos put it, "Inside the locker room, Silva is the king." It is Silva who negotiated the players' World Cup bonus money with the CBF, the Brazil Football Confederation, and when the team received criticism for some tension-induced emotional outbursts following the round of 16 matchup against Chile, it was Silva who faced the press. Granted, that's part of his job as captain, but he remains hugely respected by his teammates, and after Friday's match he couldn't hide his frustration at the disparaging comments the team had received from the media and some former Brazilian internationals. "Any criticism that we received inside of our country, those people don't have respect for us," said Silva with the help of a translator. "They said I don't have character, that I shouldn't be the captain of the team. These words are bull----. Those players were here before and they know the pressure. But they keep saying bull----. But this [win] is for us, and the people who were behind us." Neymar out of the World Cup - Neymar suffers fractured vertebra - Video (U.S. only): Neymar carried off - Duarte: The World Cup's crushing loss - World Cup Tonight: How will Brazil cope?  - Lang: Five players who must step up - Neymar injury dampens celebration - Scolari to examine lineup options - Duarte: Gritty Brazil reach the last four That makes what took place in the 64th minute all the more maddening. Ospina was about to punt the ball up field when Silva suffered a brain cramp and ran into him, which earned him a booking from referee Carlos Velasco Carballo. Given that it's Silva's second caution of the tournament, it will keep the Brazil captain out of the semifinal against Germany on Tuesday. So now Brazil finds itself without it's captain and its best player. The candidates to replace Neymar are Bernard and Willian, while Bayern Munich defender Dante seems poised to step in for Silva. In Silva's eyes, it's fitting that Dante will see the field. "It was already written, Dante had to play this game because he already plays in Germany," said Silva with the help of an interpreter. "Motivation will be the strength of the team. I'm happy for Dante, because he will have the opportunity to show the world all the quality that he has. As for me, I will try to pass tranquility to the team." Luiz expressed full confidence as well. "They are great players who have prepared for this just like Thiago and myself," said Luiz as he accepted his man of the match award. "They are dreaming as we have been dreaming today, to one day play for our national squad at a World Cup. We will be missing our captain, but I think we will be well-served." He then looked at Scolari and said, "Fortunately, God touched this man beside me. He knows how to cap good players." Including Brazil's odd couple.

Big Phil's grit gets Brazil to the semis - ESPN FC	FORTALEZA, Brazil -- Nothing was pretty about Brazil's 2-1 win over Colombia. The performance on the pitch was hardly convincing, but uglier than all was the news of Neymar's fractured vertebra that will force him out of the remainder of the tournament. To overcome the valiant Colombia and clear the quarterfinal stage for the first time since 2002, Brazil played like one of Luiz Felipe Scolari's club sides that were so feared in cup competition. Opponents knew they were ready to win ugly and be cynical. That was perhaps the biggest change in the Selecao's behaviour from last week's nerve-wracking penalty win over Chile. It worked, despite a chaotic final 10 minutes after James Rodriguez & Co. tried to mount a heroic comeback. Rodriguez himself felt that change. Fouled relentlessly by the Brazilians thanks to the very accommodating Spanish referee Carlos Carballo, who also allowed Juan Zuniga a free pass to whack opponents -- his knee in the back of Neymar the cherry on top -- the little playmaker will bear the bruises that prove how much more Brazil wanted to leave Fortaleza with the win. Albeit more organised on the pitch, the Selecao still struggle in some well-known facets. At least Fred was able to hold up play a bit longer against Colombia than he has so far in this tournament, but the time has come for him to go. Brazil still gave away too much space in midfield, and the lack of quality in the final third complicated a game they could have put to bed in the first half. But it was a gutsy step forward, earning them a date with destiny and Germany in Belo Horizonte. James Rodriguez was fouled mercilessly against Brazil. Much more heroics will be needed on Tuesday. A silly yellow card means captain Thiago Silva, who played with a point to prove after Brazil's emotional display against Chile had been widely criticised, will sit out only the country's second meeting with Germany in the history of the tournament -- the first being the 2-0 win in Yokohama 12 years ago that secured the World Cup trophy. Worse is losing Neymar. Yet Brazil managed to play without him in Fortaleza -- the Barcelona man had one of his worst games for the Selecao in some time. Like a team willing to scrape through a tricky Libertadores Cup game -- the tournament Scolari won twice in the 1990s -- Brazil latched to the opportunities they were given. Once again, dead-ball situations pulled them through -- their past three in the tournament have been scored on set pieces. Unlike in previous tournaments, though, they did not hesitate from hoofing the ball forward. Losing Neymar for the remainder of the tournament is a massive blow to Brazil. Fernandinho was immense, and Paulinho -- returning thanks only to the suspension of Luiz Gustavo -- showed some glimpses of the box-to-box player so instrumental in the Selecao's 2013 revival. In some moments, Brazil resembled the calf-biting bunch that made Spain look so ordinary in last year's Confederations Cup final. Replacing Dani Alves with Maicon provided some defensive cover that's often been missing on the right side throughout this tournament, with the Roma man adding muscle against a Colombian side whose use of the wings had proven quite a threat. Brazil will have to devise a plan for the semifinals against a German team that disposed of France very professionally at Maracana. Their last meeting, a 2011 friendly in Stuttgart, ended with a 3-2 win for Schweinsteiger's lot that flattered Brazil immensely -- the Germans toyed with Mano Menezes' side for most of the 90 minutes. The good news is that Luiz Gustavo, arguably one of Brazil's most important players in this competition, will return from his one-match suspension for yellow-card accumulation. That's welcome news for Brazil's midfield, but his presence in training will be equally important after spending two years among the Bayern contingent that populated Die Nationalmannschaft. The suspended Silva will likely be replaced by a current Bavarian regular, Dante, no matter how tricky it will be to have the leonine David Luiz playing on the right side of defence. The Selecao, nonetheless, will draw confidence from this result. They dug in and laboured a hard-earned win when many doubted their resolve after all the sobbing in Belo Horizonte.

Just like 20 years ago in the U.S., few people will appreciate ugly wins. A quick perusal of social media after the Colombia game revealed as much. Yet Brazil live to fight another day. In David Luiz they now have somebody to give the opposition something to think about from free kicks. Hulk, despite that feeble first touch, had perhaps one of his best displays for the Selecao in the first half. Of course, the attacking quartet can be reshuffled to center around Oscar and perhaps bring Willian into the picture. Yes, Brazil have big problems. But the fire in their bellies has been rekindled, and that can never be a bad thing. Few people in the host country will mind, especially without the talents of Neymar, if they beat Germany 1-0.

Lang: Making up for Neymar's loss - ESPN FC	Rarely can a victory feel so much like a defeat. Brazil secured safe passage to the semifinals of their own Copa das Copas on Friday evening with a 2-1 win over Colombia but were left counting the cost in terms of personnel. Centre-back Thiago Silva, who responded to the furor over his tears against Chile with the opening goal, would later pick up a silly booking, meaning he is suspended for Tuesday's last four encounter with Germany in Belo Horizonte. That seemed bad enough, but much worse was to come in the second half when Neymar -- Brazil's one shining light for much of this tournament -- went down following a clumsy challenge by Juan Zuniga. Neymar out of the World Cup - Neymar suffers fractured vertebra - Video (U.S. only): Neymar carried off - Duarte: The World Cup's crushing loss - World Cup Tonight: How will Brazil cope?  - Lang: Five players who must step up - Neymar injury dampens celebration - Scolari to examine lineup options - Duarte: Gritty Brazil reach the last four The Barcelona star appeared to be in pain as he was stretchered off, but few were prepared for the news that emerged after the final whistle: Neymar had fractured a vertebra and will miss the rest of the World Cup. A nation's pupils dilated, Brazil must now seek to win the competition without their best player and talisman. While the emotional fallout will continue in the coming hours and days, there are practical matters at hand for Luiz Felipe Scolari, who must replace both his captain and top scorer on Tuesday. Here are five players who will need to step up to the plate if Brazil hope to reach the final at the Maracana on July 13: Dante The Bayern Munich man is the most obvious replacement for Thiago Silva. Positionally sound and good with the ball at his feet, he certainly has the talent to step into the fray, while he will also be familiar with Germany's attacking players, having spent much of his career in the Bundesliga. Brazil will, of course, miss the Thiago Silva-David Luiz partnership, which has remained undefeated over 26 games, but Dante is more than capable of smoothing things over at the back. David Luiz Whoever takes the armband against Germany, David Luiz will be the de facto captain of the side. The defender is one of the most passionate, forceful characters in the dressing room and will be even more determined to make his voice heard in the absence of two senior teammates. He will also need to lead by example just as he did against Colombia with a rousing first-half run and a wonderful free-kick after the break that sealed the win for the Selecao. While still subject to criticism in Europe, Luiz is a giant in Brazil. Oscar A key attacking force for Brazil at last summer's Confederations Cup, Oscar has been asked to perform a less glamorous duty this summer. With Neymar playing more centrally, the Chelsea midfielder has tended to start on the flanks, spending as much time defending as contributing farther forward. Oscar scored in Brazil's opening-game win versus Croatia but has since had a quiet World Cup. As a result, he has yet to produce the performances of which everyone knows he is capable. Perhaps now he will be granted a central berth and greater freedom. Willian If Oscar does indeed move into the hole, it is likely that Willian will get his first start of the tournament out wide. The 25-year-old impressed in the pre-tournament friendlies against Panama and Serbia and can feel slightly aggrieved not to have played a more significant role in Brazil's campaign thus far. Now might be his moment to shine. Fred With Neymar sidelined, the goals will have to come from somewhere else. Fred has had a poor tournament so far, failing to get involved with Brazil's buildup play and lacking his usual ruthlessness in front of goal. However, with Jo the only other striker in the squad, he remains the most likely to pick up the slack. Scolari must hope that he raises his game against Germany.

Replacing Dani Alves with Maicon provided some defensive cover that's often been missing on the right side throughout this tournament, with the Roma man adding muscle against a Colombian side whose use of the wings had proven quite a threat. Brazil will have to devise a plan for the semifinals against a German team that disposed of France very professionally at Maracana. Their last meeting, a 2011 friendly in Stuttgart, ended with a 3-2 win for Schweinsteiger's lot that flattered Brazil immensely -- the Germans toyed with Mano Menezes' side for most of the 90 minutes. The good news is that Luiz Gustavo, arguably one of Brazil's most important players in this competition, will return from his one-match suspension for yellow-card accumulation. That's welcome news for Brazil's midfield, but his presence in training will be equally important after spending two years among the Bayern contingent that populated Die Nationalmannschaft. The suspended Silva will likely be replaced by a current Bavarian regular, Dante, no matter how tricky it will be to have the leonine David Luiz playing on the right side of defence. The Selecao, nonetheless, will draw confidence from this result. They dug in and laboured a hard-earned win when many doubted their resolve after all the sobbing in Belo Horizonte.

Just like 20 years ago in the U.S., few people will appreciate ugly wins. A quick perusal of social media after the Colombia game revealed as much. Yet Brazil live to fight another day. In David Luiz they now have somebody to give the opposition something to think about from free kicks. Hulk, despite that feeble first touch, had perhaps one of his best displays for the Selecao in the first half. Of course, the attacking quartet can be reshuffled to center around Oscar and perhaps bring Willian into the picture. Yes, Brazil have big problems. But the fire in their bellies has been rekindled, and that can never be a bad thing. Few people in the host country will mind, especially without the talents of Neymar, if they beat Germany 1-0.

Brazil in semifinals thanks to odd couple of Thiago Silva and David Luiz - ESPN FC	FORTALEZA, Brazil -- On a day when Brazil lost star midfielder Neymar for the rest of the World Cup with a fractured vertebra, the Selecao turned to their odd couple -- defenders Thiago Silva and David Luiz -- to pull them through. The two leaders in the back scored goals either side of halftime to propel Brazil to a 2-1 quarterfinal victory over Colombia. Silva latched onto a Neymar's corner kick and deflected the ball home with his knee with the game less than seven minutes old. In the 69th minute, Luiz hit a scorching 34-yard free kick past Colombia goalkeeper David Ospina. It was difficult to tell what possessed more maniacal ferocity -- the shot, or his celebratory run to the near side corner flag. "Everyone knows I train a lot on this every day," said Luiz in the post-match mixed zone. "Today I hit the ball in exactly the [right] point. So when I saw the ball, it moved a lot and it was difficult for the goalkeeper. I was happy with this." Luiz then spared a thought for Neymar, who was kneed in the back in the 86th minute by Colombia defender Juan Zuniga. The Brazilian No. 10 had to be stretchered off, and afterward Brazil team doctor Rodrigo Lasmar announced that the player had suffered a fractured lumbar vertebra that will keep him out 2-3 weeks. Neymar's World Cup is over, muting much of the feel-good factor that existed at having reached the semifinals. "I'm so happy, we're in the semifinal round of the World Cup," said Luiz. "We've dreamed about this. But I'm a little bit sad that Neymar is out of the competition. He's a great guy, great person, great player, who brings great things for football. Now he's going to be out, and everyone feels a bit sad. He's like my brother." It was a night where in addition to the goals, Silva and Luiz did their bit on the defensive end as well, cutting out numerous through balls from Colombian danger man James Rodriguez. The Colombian No. 10 finally did unlock Brazil's defense in the 78th minute, releasing substitute Carlos Bacca, who was felled by goalkeeper Julio Cesar. Rodriguez dispatched the resulting penalty to take his tournament tally to six, but for the rest of the night, Silva and Luiz -- with the help of Fernandinho who benefited form some lenient refereeing -- managed to help keep Brazil's net clean. Brazil's odd couple pairing of Thiago Silva and David Luiz will be split up in the semifinal as Silva serves a suspension. Silva and Luiz make for an odd pairing in the back, given the differences in their respective personalities. Silva cuts a commanding presence, but is very religious and soft spoken. Luiz projects a different kind of charisma, like a big kid, often taking selfies after big wins. When Brazil entered the field for the pregame warm-up, the differences were evident again. Silva was all business while Luiz sprinted out with his arms raised, signaling a No. 1 with each index finger. But as ESPN colleague Paulo Cobos put it, "Inside the locker room, Silva is the king." It is Silva who negotiated the players' World Cup bonus money with the CBF, the Brazil Football Confederation, and when the team received criticism for some tension-induced emotional outbursts following the round of 16 matchup against Chile, it was Silva who faced the press. Granted, that's part of his job as captain, but he remains hugely respected by his teammates, and after Friday's match he couldn't hide his frustration at the disparaging comments the team had received from the media and some former Brazilian internationals. "Any criticism that we received inside of our country, those people don't have respect for us," said Silva with the help of a translator. "They said I don't have character, that I shouldn't be the captain of the team. These words are bull----. Those players were here before and they know the pressure. But they keep saying bull----. But this [win] is for us, and the people who were behind us." Neymar out of the World Cup - Neymar suffers fractured vertebra - Video (U.S. only): Neymar carried off - Duarte: The World Cup's crushing loss - World Cup Tonight: How will Brazil cope?  - Lang: Five players who must step up - Neymar injury dampens celebration - Scolari to examine lineup options - Duarte: Gritty Brazil reach the last four That makes what took place in the 64th minute all the more maddening. Ospina was about to punt the ball up field when Silva suffered a brain cramp and ran into him, which earned him a booking from referee Carlos Velasco Carballo. Given that it's Silva's second caution of the tournament, it will keep the Brazil captain out of the semifinal against Germany on Tuesday. So now Brazil finds itself without it's captain and its best player. The candidates to replace Neymar are Bernard and Willian, while Bayern Munich defender Dante seems poised to step in for Silva. In Silva's eyes, it's fitting that Dante will see the field. "It was already written, Dante had to play this game because he already plays in Germany," said Silva with the help of an interpreter. "Motivation will be the strength of the team. I'm happy for Dante, because he will have the opportunity to show the world all the quality that he has. As for me, I will try to pass tranquility to the team." Luiz expressed full confidence as well. "They are great players who have prepared for this just like Thiago and myself," said Luiz as he accepted his man of the match award. "They are dreaming as we have been dreaming today, to one day play for our national squad at a World Cup. We will be missing our captain, but I think we will be well-served." He then looked at Scolari and said, "Fortunately, God touched this man beside me. He knows how to cap good players." Including Brazil's odd couple.

Marcotti: Germany back in the old routine against France - ESPN FC	Sometimes the old-fashioned way really is the best way. Hollywood loves that sort of thing. A bunch of semi-retired criminals getting together for one last score. Or the creaking old-timers reuniting and calmly, competently, teaching the young guns a thing or two. Jogi Low turned to his past to answer the questions in his present. Faced with pace on the counter and the muscle in the midfield of Les Bleus, he turned back the clock in so many ways and not just because seven of his starting 11 were the same as those who faced Spain when the 2010 World Cup dream came to an end. The key was moving Philipp Lahm to right-back, a shift with cascading implications throughout the German side. You can easily identify four of them, all of which played a part in the victory. - Jones: The match that failed to fire - Delaney: France run out of steam - Honigstein: Germany do enough for victory It meant the back four now had width going forward and agility defensively. It meant Jerome Boateng could slot inside alongside Mats Hummels, at the expense of Per Mertesacker. It meant Bastian Schweinsteiger and Sami Khedira could renew their partnership in the middle of the park. And it meant that a more natural centre-forward was needed, which is why Low turned to 36-year-old Miroslav Klose up front, shelving the "false nine" business. All of this together resulted in a Germany that looked more like Low's early work. Gone was the "death by possession" ethos, the philosophy he tried to transplant from Pep Guardiola's Bayern to suit his team's Bavarian spine. Instead, you had brawn and work rate in the middle, directness in possession and a team that seemed just as comfortable without the ball as it is with it. "I've always said we were able to change formation and style; it's one of our strengths," he said. "Against Algeria we played one way, now we wanted to make a change." True, it's something he always "said." But managers say lots of things. Not all have the humility to change. Fewer still get it so right when they do. With Lahm's legs and intelligence in the back four -- he was also the guy looking across the defensive line and making sure the offside trap held -- the high line that was torn to shreds by Algeria didn't look so haphazard. Manuel Neuer had to play sweeper only occasionally. Low even described it as an offensive weapon. ("It's a luxury to have a keeper who is so comfortable on the ball, it means that a defender under pressure can play it back and you still retain control because Neuer won't just clear it up the pitch, he'll find a pass.") Boateng and Hummels simply complement each other much better than Hummels and Mertesacker. If it's about putting your key players in roles where they are more comfortable, this one makes sense every day of the week. At Borussia Dortmund, Hummels is used to playing with a quick, athletic partner (Neven Subotic until his injury, Sokratis Papastathopoulos after). But when he's paired with the Arsenal centre-back, Hummels finds himself as the more agile of the two, and it's not something he's always comfortable with. (Mertesacker, to his credit, took the exclusion well. Low said that when he informed him he would be sitting out, the big man said: "Coach, if it helps the team, I'm happy with it.") Schweinsteiger and Khedira had turned into an either/or dilemma. Shifting Lahm meant both could play, like they had done so many times together in the past. They too are obvious complements, particularly when a side doesn't obsess over possession. They were also more suited to the physical battle with France's tough guys -- Paul Pogba, Yohan Cabaye and Blaise Matuidi -- than the more lightweight Lahm. "France are very dense in midfield," Low said, using a term that may sound unusual in English but neatly captures France's central brawn. "With Cabaye and Pogba, they are so strong, it becomes very tough to go through the center, so my idea was to have Lahm attack from the right." Lahm, as ever, got more touches than any other German player, though -- obviously -- he wasn't able to influence the game personally the way he's done for the past year in midfield. But it forced France to adjust: Patrice Evra sat more than he usually does, Matuidi and Pogba found themselves drawn to Lahm's side. France coach Didier Deschamps said he wasn't surprised at Lahm's move. "It's his natural position, he plays there most of the time," he said, which actually isn't true at all. "But wherever he is, he's going to be one of the most influential players." Mats Hummels heads Germany into the semifinals. Klose, who -- ridiculous as it sounds -- scored his first World Cup goal way back in 2002, obviously lacks the stamina or pace he once had. But few players in the world, even today, are as adept at finding space and making the kind of intelligent runs that unsettle defenders. His movement allowed Germany to play more directly and made the game simpler for the likes of Mesut Ozil and Toni Kroos. The changes made Germany more battle-ready, better equipped to deal with the French threat and the war of attrition this game became. The early goal, of course, made things considerably simpler. Less than 15 minutes into it, Hummels' masterpiece of power, timing and penalty-box savoir-faire allowed him to best Raphael Varane and beat Hugo Lloris. It was the first time France went behind in this World Cup. Instead of an instant reaction, it took them time to regroup: "We were too timid in the first half" Deschamps admitted. This was in part because of Germany's press in midfield. Off the ball, the front men retreated, the back four pushed up and there were maybe 20 paces between the deepest German defender and Klose at the other end. This meant congested spaces and plenty of big bodies to play through, making things tougher for Les Bleus. France realized they had to go over the top, spring the high line and try to find Antoine Griezmann and Karim Benzema with little chips and dinks. But what worked so well for Algeria failed here, in part because of Boateng's central presence and Lahm's leadership of the back line. The one time they did manage it, with just over half an hour gone, Neuer produced a brilliant save from Mathieu Valbuena's shot after a perfectly timed run and cross from Griezmann. France have never managed to come back and avoid defeat when down at half-time in a World Cup game. They wouldn't manage it on Friday either. The best they could do was a Varane header, swatted away by Neuer, and Benzema's last-minute diagonal. In the meantime, Germany, who had brought on the fleet-footed Andre Schurrle, had at least three outstanding chances. "Yeah, they could have scored a second; we became vulnerable to their counter because we had to chase the game," Deschamps conceded. The question now is whether Friday was a Plan B and Low will restore Lahm to his deep-lying playmaker role, or whether the DeutschTikiTaka is a project to be shelved (at least temporarily). It worked against the French in a game that became a tactical battle and was blessed with an early German goal. It may not encounter the same success against a different opponent. And with Schweinsteiger and Khedira dogged by fitness issues -- and Klose not getting any younger and unlikely to give you more than an hour on the pitch -- you wonder how viable (let alone desirable) it is. For all of Lahm's influence in the possession system as a playmaker, there's another Lahm -- let's call him right-back Lahm -- sitting in a little metal box that says "BREAK GLASS IN CASE OF EMERGENCY." That's what Low did. The question now is whether he puts him back in his little box and goes with the other one.	sports

Chris Jones writes that Germany vs. France failed to launch at the historic Maracana - ESPN FC	RIO DE JANEIRO -- There was a strange feeling heading toward the Maracana on Friday morning, a kind of unexpected restraint. France and Germany, two former champions, the anchors of Europe, were about to play a World Cup match for the first time since 1986, in one of football's legendary stadiums. There was some bustle in the streets, and the bars were filled by mid-morning. Lines of riot police occupied closed-off territory. Yet it already felt as though we were about to watch the undercard to the Brazilian main event taking place more than 1,000 miles away. It was too bad. These are the sorts of days all of us anticipate like gifts. As the World Cup marches on, there are fewer dreams, but they are larger. The matches become less predictable, more consequential; they stand better chances of being rated classics. The players want to play a game that will become part of a well-loved history and of future montages, and the fans hope to see something worth committing to their collective memories. This is the grand bargain of football: Each game is another chance for you to say you were there. The French were stymied as everyone at the Maracana endured a difficult afternoon. More than 74,000 were there at the Maracana on Friday, July 4. They watched Germany score in the 13th minute -- a sweet little header off the bar by Mats Hummels, who was led to it by a perfect free kick from Toni Kroos -- and perhaps unsurprisingly they didn't see very much else. The French had occasional chances, but Manuel Neuer was tall and solid in the German goal. The Germans half-countered with a couple of strong runs late in the game, but really they just did what they had to do to win 1-0, disciplined and defensive. "We were always stepping on the opponents' toes," Joachim Low said after, and that requires its own art. But a long series of frustrations doesn't exactly make the heart swell. When the final whistle blew, there were pockets of French tears and German celebration, but mostly there was the slight feeling that comes with the solving of a small puzzle.

A match like this one ideally shouldn't be played in front of so many neutrals; it takes the life out of them.

It was a fight you didn't want to see anybody win. France versus Germany, the 2014 version, wasn't even much of a fight. It was the 58th game out of 64 of them, the first of the quarterfinals.

Chris Jones writes that Germany vs. France failed to launch at the historic Maracana - ESPN FC	RIO DE JANEIRO -- There was a strange feeling heading toward the Maracana on Friday morning, a kind of unexpected restraint. France and Germany, two former champions, the anchors of Europe, were about to play a World Cup match for the first time since 1986, in one of football's legendary stadiums. There was some bustle in the streets, and the bars were filled by mid-morning. Lines of riot police occupied closed-off territory. Yet it already felt as though we were about to watch the undercard to the Brazilian main event taking place more than 1,000 miles away. It was too bad. These are the sorts of days all of us anticipate like gifts. As the World Cup marches on, there are fewer dreams, but they are larger. The matches become less predictable, more consequential; they stand better chances of being rated classics. The players want to play a game that will become part of a well-loved history and of future montages, and the fans hope to see something worth committing to their collective memories. This is the grand bargain of football: Each game is another chance for you to say you were there. The French were stymied as everyone at the Maracana endured a difficult afternoon. More than 74,000 were there at the Maracana on Friday, July 4. They watched Germany score in the 13th minute -- a sweet little header off the bar by Mats Hummels, who was led to it by a perfect free kick from Toni Kroos -- and perhaps unsurprisingly they didn't see very much else. The French had occasional chances, but Manuel Neuer was tall and solid in the German goal.

Miguel Delaney says France run out of steam in quarterfinals of World Cup - ESPN FC	RIO DE JANEIRO -- After all the talk of a repeat of 1982, Friday's match at the Maracana only ended up recalling the last few years: Germany making another World Cup semifinal (their fourth in a row); France meekly bowing out of a tournament they promised so much more in. This was a long way from the drama of that 3-3 classic -- which Germany won on penalties -- 32 years ago, and not even close to the same levels of entertainment. That was because there was one clearly superior side, who never even had to stand tall in a siege. A 1-0 final score made this game look far closer than it actually was; Germany were just never made to worry. That will be the most encouraging aspect for Joachim Low, but the most galling for France boss Didier Deschamps. As France looked for a way back into the match, there was no crescendo at the end, just a huge anticlimax. Some of the scenes with just three minutes of normal time to go were so disappointingly notable, especially given the previous games of this World Cup (see the USA against Belgium in the round of 16). But with their entire tournament teetering on the edge, France just couldn't raise the required energy. It was only Karim Benzema who showed anything like the kind of urgency that reflected the situation, and it came as no surprise that it was his shot that gave the Germans their only moment of anxiety in those oddly mundane final few minutes -- although it was easily saved by keeper Manuel Neuer. Much of that might have had to do with the suffocating conditions under the Rio sun, but it still does not feel like enough to explain why France couldn't make Low and his team feel any heat whatsoever. The joy of their play from the earlier games had seemingly evaporated and, as the Germans closed ranks, used the ball well and held them off with ease, they only looked jaded. That will be all the more frustrating because, after a World Cup that felt so dynamically different to pretty much anything from the French team in the last decade, it only ended up offering their fourth underwhelming exit in succession. In the end, when you look back in hindsight, it may not seem that different from the 2-0 quarterfinal defeat to Spain at Euro 2012. Yet if France ultimately returned to the disappointment of the last few years, Germany finally banished some of their doubts of the last few games. With Philipp Lahm restored to right-back and Sami Khedira in defensive midfield, there was much greater balance to their team, and much fewer chances being given away. This was Germany at their most polished yet, and a performance that suggested Low may be right: they may finally be ready to grow as the quality of the opposition increases. That would mark a change, and at last see them peak at the right time, particularly without the presence of the Spanish. At the same time, it should not go unnoticed that they didn't even need to be at their peak here. Germany still made errors; France illustrated their flaws at times, but never offered the conviction to suggest they could properly punish them. On repeated occasions in the first half, Germany were opened by the easiest of long balls. One such move ended with a ragged cross that still caused all manner of chaos, but Mathieu Valbuena just couldn't offer the finish. As on so many other occasions in the game, Neuer stood tall, and never needed to extend himself much. It was even notable that his forays outside his area had been toned down since the round of 16 game against Algeria brought him so much attention. Antoine Griezmann was unable to have an impact as Germany closed ranks. France couldn't go any further themselves. At the times when Germany did manage to close down the option of that over-the-top pass, Deschamps' attack didn't know where to go, and looked much less dynamic than they had done previously. Valbuena and Antoine Griezmann never offered the vigour of recent matches; they were hugely underwhelming, and it would not be outlandish to say France were a little overawed. Deschamps admitted afterwards: "Germany are accustomed to these big matches. They are a more experienced team and we were a little timid in the beginning of the match. We were not efficient. Maybe toward the end of the game, we were too exposed, but all in all, when you look at what Germany stands for and where we come from, we are frustrated. There is a massive gap between the two teams, but today we had a good game and played at a very high level." Of those who could be said to have played at a high level today, only Benzema was really trying to force the issue -- although even he could barely force a save until that final moment. At the other end, there was the simplicity with which the French defence was exposed. For all the suggestions that Germany were susceptible to set pieces, Mats Hummels shored them up at one end and opened things at the other. He got the only touch necessary for Toni Kroos' divine cross to seal what turned out to be the winner. The early goal set up their performance, and apparently set France right back. Deschamps can take encouragement from this World Cup, but not from this quarterfinal. Germany, meanwhile, can finally look forward; France couldn't expose them at the back.

Netherlands not a great team - Louis van Gaal - ESPN FC	Despite being their coach, Louis van Gaal does not think Netherlands are a great team, but believes they can win the World Cup as they are hard to beat. - Kuper: Dutch close to realizing their dream - Pinto 'worried' about Robben diving Four years on from falling at the final hurdle to Spain in South Africa, the Oranje are preparing for a quarterfinal against surprise package Costa Rica. It is a match they enter as overwhelming favourites, with Argentina or Belgium lying in wait if they reach the semifinals. Van Gaal is confident his side will get through Saturday's clash in Salvador, but laughed off suggestions they are feeling under pressure given Costa Rica are seen as having nothing to lose. "Well, I may have some news for you -- the Dutch media did not expect that we would get this far either,'' he told his prematch news conference. "Everything we are achieving now should be fantastic for the Dutch media, but that is not the issue. The issue is our own objectives, our goal. "Our goal has always been to become world champions and we have already said we are a team which is very difficult to beat. "We're not a great team, but a team which is difficult to beat. So far we have shown that and I hope we can continue that up to and including the final. "That Costa Rica are considered to be a less strong team, that is by the media. That is not our words, we are not saying that.'' Van Gaal's suggestion that Netherlands are "not a great team" will raise some eyebrows, especially as they thrashed reigning champions Spain 5-1 in their Group B opener. The Oranje return to the scene of that triumph -- the Arena Fonte Nova -- for the Costa Rica tie. Ahead of the match, one reporter suggested that perhaps Van Gaal was guilty of underestimating his own team. "Well, perhaps, yes, you may be right,'' he said. "But we have always said since the preparation for this World Cup that it will not be the best or most fantastic team that is going to win, but the best 23 players will win this. "We all have one goal, we are all supporting each other, complementing each other. That's what the Dutch team is, all 23 players. "We've been able to achieve outstanding results and this what we see. "That will remain for the entire tournament, even if we lose. The Dutch team will fight right to the very last minute to become world champions.'' Van Gaal sat alongside injured midfielder Nigel de Jong -- who has been ruled out of the rest of the tournament -- at the prematch news conference, and the coach spoke about the importance of the elder statesman to his young side. The most important of that group is arguably captain Robin van Persie, who Van Gaal will again work with when he takes the reins at Manchester United after the World Cup. "We have four or five older players and the influence of these older players is quite substantial because we have a very young group of players,'' he said. "It is pleasant for a coach, for a trainer, to have these players that will do everything it takes, who will also look after these players in the spirit of the trainer.''	sports

McIntyre: Los Ticos ready for another surprise - ESPN FC	SALVADOR, Brazil -- Anyone expecting the Netherlands to crush Costa Rica on Saturday afternoon is probably going to be disappointed. It seems like an audacious statement on its face. The Dutch are arguably the best team never to be crowned world champion, while the upstart Ticos come into the match already breathing rarified air, already having delivered the best performance in their tiny nation's history. Nonetheless, the new reality of the international game is there's no such thing as a mismatch anymore, especially when it comes down to the final five teams standing at a World Cup. Forget history and ignore the FIFA rankings, if you don't already; all that matters now is the next 90 (or quite possibly 120) minutes, something Oranje coach Louis van Gaal is none too aware of heading into the match. "I never said Costa Rica was a weaker team," Van Gaal said at Friday's prematch press conference, scolding journalists from his home country who had suggested otherwise. "The high number of games going to extra time shows that there are almost no differences between the teams. This is, undoubtedly, the best World Cup I've seen in the last 30 years." Costa Rica prepare for the country's first World Cup quarterfinal. Besides, it's not like his counterpart is just happy to be there. Sure, Ticos boss Jorge Luis Pinto is playing with house money now, having led his team a round of 16 victory over Greece after wins against Italy and Uruguay (plus a scoreless tie against England) in the only group in World Cup history to feature three former champions. But he's not about to fold now. "It's not easy to beat three great powers when nobody believes in us," Pinto said Friday. "But we believe in our work, in the team's preparation, in each player's dedication on the pitch. We have analyzed everything, and I know that we'll keep on going. " Why shouldn't they? It's not like the Netherlands have been totally convincing in Brazil, despite four wins from four games. Mexico was minutes away from eliminating the Dutch in the round of 16 before imploding, and Costa Rica beat and tied El Tri during qualifying this past year. Van Gaal himself conceded that the 2014 version of his national squad isn't the "Clockwork Orange" side of lore, the one that went to two finals in the 1970s or even the one that did the same in South Africa four years ago. "I've always said we're not a fantastic team," the Dutch manager admitted on the eve of the match. "But it's very difficult to defeat us." Netherlands vs. Costa Rica: July 5 (ESPN and WatchESPN) - Kuper: Dutch close in on World Cup - Steppe: Robben's transformation - Delaney: Costa Rica's run by the numbers - 50-50 Challenge: Netherlands vs. Costa Rica - Levin: Navas saves the day again and again - McIntyre: Pinto has Ticos primed That, of course, is Pinto's challenge. The Colombian has been as shrewd a manager as any in the competition to this point. None have gotten more out of less, and he knows full well the opportunity of a lifetime is staring him in the face now, no matter how many think another upset is impossible. "It is possible," he said. It could take outwitting Van Gaal, which won't be easy, but Pinto believes he has an ace up his sleeve. As a young man, one of his mentors was legendary Dutch coach Rinus Michels, the architect of those '70s-era "Total Football" teams and someone whom Pinto befriended in the early 1980s while a student in Cologne, Germany, where Michels was running the local Bundesliga club. "I've been looking at Dutch football since then," Pinto said. Star striker Bryan Ruiz also knows Saturday's opponent well, having spent two seasons in the Netherlands before moving to the Premier League in 2011 (he returned to the Eredivisie on loan with PSV Eindhoven in the second half of the 2013-14 season). All that doesn't change the fact that the Dutch remain the heavy favorite. "Our goal continues to be winning the World Cup," Van Gaal said. Costa Rica's is merely to live to fight another day. "My team is a team for challenges," Pinto said. "We've always believed." Believe this: Although the odds say the Netherlands will prevail in the end, it won't end with the rout many are predicting.

Netherlands close in on their first-ever World Cup - ESPN FC	RIO DE JANEIRO -- Holland's new hero going into Saturday's quarterfinal with Costa Rica is not the world's most talented player. He's good old Dirk Kuyt, 33. "He starts as left-back, then he's right-back, and when the situation demands it he plays striker," marveled Johan Cruyff, the man who invented Dutch soccer, after Holland's last-gasp round of 16 victory over Mexico. "You're blessed as a team if you have someone like that. With Kuyt you can go in all directions tactically." That's what the Dutch have started to do. They are revealing themselves as possibly the tournament's most tactically flexible team. Conversely, after losing Nigel de Jong, their midfield is becoming as big a worry as their shaky defense. Holland went into the World Cup playing a 5-3-2 formation, chiefly because coach Louis van Gaal had decided that his inexperienced defenders needed extra cover against the world's best strikers. The system worked beautifully in the opening 5-1 win over Spain. But in the next match against Australia, Holland soon switched to playing three up front, and did it again after going one down to Mexico. During the second-half drinks break, still chasing the equalizer with just 15 minutes left, Van Gaal even moved Kuyt forward to create a four-man attack. Simon Gleave, head of analysis at the Dutch-based Infostrada Sports company, notes that these positional changes have been a Dutch trademark since the "Total Football" era of the 1970s. In this tournament, they have been executed so intelligently that even pro-Cruyff media in the Netherlands are now praising his ancient enemy Van Gaal.  The coach hasn't yet revealed which formation Holland will use against Costa Rica, though many Dutch fans yearn for a return to Holland's traditional 4-3-3. When the Algemeen Dagblad newspaper polled readers online, that's what the majority wanted. Playing three up front would push the Dutch to a more possession-based, less counterattacking game. If Memphis Depay plays left-wing in a three-man attack, it would help playmaker Wesley Sneijder, who tends to pass to the left. When Sneijder has only two targets up front, he struggles to find them. This tournament, he has been chiefly a defensive runner. He has covered, on average, three kilometers more per game than Argentina's creator, a certain Lionel Messi, notes the Algemeen Dagblad. Sneijder, who was not in the best shape just months ago, is now the fit centrepiece of a fit team that, against Chile and Mexico, sealed two straight victories in the closing minutes in the heat. Netherlands vs. Costa Rica: July 5 (ESPN and WatchESPN) - Kuper: Dutch close in on World Cup - Steppe: Robben's transformation - Delaney: Costa Rica's run by the numbers - 50-50 Challenge: Netherlands vs. Costa Rica - Levin: Navas saves the day again and again - McIntyre: Pinto has Ticos primed The attack is Holland's only world-class line. Stats from data provider Opta reveal their frightening efficiency: 63 percent of Dutch shots have been on target, the most of any team here, and Holland have attempted on average only 120 passes per goal, the fewest of any team. The best of the Oranje's forwards so far is of course Arjen Robben. Van Gaal, against his own principles, has created a team that relies on the dribbles of one genius, and probably no previous Dutch team depended more on a single player (Holland reached the 1978 World Cup final without Cruyff.) Robben is wily -- too wily for some. He may not get another penalty in this World Cup after admitting that he dived once against Mexico, though the penalty he did get looked real: Rafael Marquez stepped on his foot, even if Robben then went gratefully to ground. Normally quiet, Robben has become influential off the field too. Midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum says: "He's a real leader, the sort of captain you'd expect. Arjen keeps us sharp, talks a lot more than Robin van Persie [the actual captain]. He keeps talking about Euro 2008. Then too it went fantastically in the group stage, but as soon as it really counted they weren't there and got knocked out [by Russia in the quarterfinal]. Robben absolutely wants to prevent that." Robben is 30 now, as are Van Persie, Sneijder and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar. They suspect this is their last chance of a prize with Holland and that may be why they are behaving in Brazil, in contrast with the endless squabbles in Ukraine during Euro 2012. Then, Huntelaar couldn't handle being a sub. Now he calls his match-saving cameo against Mexico "the best moment of my career." Holland's camp in Rio -- where Van Gaal cancels the odd training session, and children and wives are frequent visitors -- sometimes resembles a family beach holiday. Holland's problem is the weak back eight. Before the World Cup, Dutch fans were despondent about a defense drawn chiefly from their own domestic league. Now De Jong's groin injury, which rules him out of the tournament, weakens the defensive midfield too. "One of my biggest pawns," Van Gaal called him. (The word "pawn" is revealing. Van Gaal has a tendency to see players merely as cogs in his brilliant tactical schemes.) No other Dutch midfielder can win balls like De Jong. Daley Blind passes forward better, but loses too many duels, and allowed Giovani dos Santos to shoot for Mexico's goal. Still, Blind will play in central midfield from now on, with beside him either Wijnaldum or the only one of Holland's 20 outfield players not to have featured yet, Jordy Clasie. That won't scare Costa Rica, who are led by Bryan Ruiz, the man who finished last season on loan to PSV Eindhoven in the Netherlands. Historically, Dutch arrogance goes in cycles. The better Holland's team is, the more likely it is to underestimate opponents. Now, with several weaker players, the Dutch are in a humble phase. It would be unforgivable to underestimate a Costa Rican side that has already beaten Uruguay, Italy and Greece. Still, even now the Dutch are tempted to do exactly that. It's in their nature. Sneijder tried for modesty, saying, "Costa Rica is a good South American team." But in fact Costa Rica is a Central American team. Given that there is no invincible team here in Brazil, the Dutch have a decent shot at winning their first-ever World Cup. If they throw this one away, they won't forgive themselves.	sports
Benzema exits Brazil with a whimper - ESPN FC	Karim Benzema's World Cup campaign could not have started much better. In the opening win over Honduras and the following thumping of Switzerland, the French No. 10 had amassed three goals and three assists and was being talked up as a potential star of the tournament. Fast-forward three games and the Real Madrid man leaves Brazil with his French teammates after the 1-0 defeat to Germany in Rio de Janeiro having failed to add a single goal or assist to his total since. Benzema was disappointing at the Maracana on Friday, although his struggles were not necessarily solely down to him. France did not turn up for their quarterfinal clash the same way they did for their opening group encounters and towards the end of their round-of-16 clash with Nigeria, and the 26-year-old was one of those made to suffer the most. Les Bleus' attack never really got going against a balanced but vulnerable German back line. Benzema had a number of chances, but rarely looked like the same player he was at the start of the tournament. Against Nigeria he looked disinterested, but against Germany he just looked ineffectual. The midfield were not linking up as well with the attack and -- following the introduction of Antoine Griezmann -- Benzema was expected to become the focal point of the attack in Olivier Giroud's absence. That did not happen, and now the former Olympique Lyonnais man's tournament is over. Before the World Cup, Benzema needed a big overall performance to possibly save his international career after failing to replicate his club form with his country. He just about managed to provide that in Brazil, and manager Didier Deschamps utilising him for every minute of every game suggests he won't be thrown out for France's next fixture, but there will remain a feeling that this was a missed opportunity for Benzema. He was in form and enjoying his football after the first two matches before Deschamps decided to change a number of players for the goalless draw with Ecuador. After that, the Real Madrid man's form and confidence have not been the same, and it is difficult not to feel that those changes affected the mercurial talent. Benzema had the chance to set the world alight after the start he made and did not show the hunger to kick on after his opening couple of performances. That was once again evident against Germany, when he was a spectral presence at times and had to resort to taking chance off of his own teammates' boots. Karim Benzema put in another forgettable performance for France in the quarterfinals. Against Joachim Low's side, he failed to link up in the same way we have seen him previously combine with Mathieu Valbuena and Griezmann, playing with less authority in the central role than exhibited in the opening game against Honduras. Benzema's best chances often came through balls played over the top that he was able to run on to, exploiting Germany's lack of pace and uncharacteristic problems in dealing with high balls. It was a chance for Benzema to prove he can go up against the best in the world and still lead France past them and, like in many of the big games, the Real Madrid star still went missing. There was enough shown by Benzema in Brazil to suggest that he is not yet a lost cause for Deschamps, but the Germany clash was a test of his appetite that he once again failed. Doubts will continue to persist that France cannot rely solely on their No. 10, and the likes of Giroud should get plenty of opportunities ahead of the 2016 UEFA European Championship.

Steppe: Robben's transformation to team player - ESPN FC	It's still hard to believe: Arjen Robben, known as arguably one of the most selfish players who has ever played in the national team of the Netherlands, gave away the exquisite opportunity to score the winning goal against Mexico. The powerful attacker gave the penalty opportunity to Klaas-Jan Huntelaar. It is an image that marks the tremendous change Robben has made in his career; he now knows what a team needs most. Only three years ago, that picture was different. Robben's chronic injuries, his selfishness and also his refusal to pick up defensive tasks excluded him from the ranks held by Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo as the world's best. The Netherlands ended that season with a trip to Brazil to meet the Canaries in a friendly. The game ended in a goalless draw. That wouldn't have happened if Robben had not been centered on his own scoring. At one point during the match, on one of his characteristic dribbles, Robben penetrated the Brazilian box. Robin van Persie saw this and got himself completely free, waiting for Robben to pass him the ball. It didn't happen. From a difficult angle Robben tried his luck. No goal. Netherlands vs. Costa Rica: July 5 (ESPN and WatchESPN) - Kuper: Dutch close in on World Cup - Steppe: Robben's transformation - Delaney: Costa Rica's run by the numbers - 50-50 Challenge: Netherlands vs. Costa Rica - Levin: Navas saves the day again and again - McIntyre: Pinto has Ticos primed "Unbelievable," Van Persie fumed to Dutch television after the game. "He saw me and he decided to take his own chance. I really can't imagine that I would have chosen to do the same." The then Arsenal, now Manchester United ace was right. It was unbelievable and another sign that Robben was top class, but not master class. Robben heard the reproach of Van Persie and pleaded guilty. It's not certain if that was the exact moment Robben became another player. He missed important penalties for Bayern Munich and was one of the players who contributed to the powerless performance of Oranje at the 2012 European championships in Poland and Ukraine. When coach Bert van Marwijk asked for more work in a match versus Portugal, Robben's answer was loud and clear: "Shut up." Robben eventually did become stronger. First mostly known as the "man of glass," Robben now shook off injuries. After an enormous list of physical damage in the first 10 years of his career, he suffered only one last season. Not a muscle injury or a strain, but a deep flesh wound after a collision with FC Augsburg goalkeeper Marwin Hitz. Arjen Robben has fiercely led the Netherlands into the World Cup quarterfinals. Robben became not only physically stronger, but also mentally. He was the decider in the Champions League final in 2013 and took in a natural way the co-leadership (with Robin van Persie) for the national team of the Netherlands. Robben chose the current World Cup as his peak moment to shine in front of the entire world -- but now with the knowledge that he needs his teammates, just as much as they need him. It's not only his goals, his continuous threat for the opponent, his assists or his solo efforts that leave the opponent in constant despair. It's what he does for the group. After the 5-1 victory against Spain the first thing he said to his teammates was "we still have nothing." Instead of going for his own success, Robben has an eye for his comrades in Oranje. Robben even reached the point where he decided it would be wiser that the fresh substitute Huntelaar took the penalty in extra time against Mexico. With a quarter on the clock, head coach Louis van Gaal had his last chance to tell his players how to beat Mexico to reach the quarterfinals. But during the drink break in the oven of Estádio Castelão in Fortaleza, Brazil, it was Robben who spoke the most. The normally controlling Van Gaal gave probably the biggest compliment: "I am here for the technical part. Arjen for the motivational part." At the age of 30 Robben appears to have reached his top form. In all possible ways. And with the absence of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and the pale performance by Cristiano Ronaldo at this World Cup, only two players can compete with him for being the best player worldwide: Lionel Messi and the fabulous Colombian James Rodriguez. Robben has now most definitely entered the room where only master-class players are allowed.

Erratic Netherlands playmaker Wesley Sneijder a man for the key moments - ESPN FC	SALVADOR, Brazil -- Louis van Gaal meant it in a positive way, of course, but it did leave the question there to be asked. The Netherlands manager was sitting in front of the world's media in Salvador's Arena Fonte Nova ahead of his side's World Cup quarterfinal with Costa Rica on Saturday evening. He was, by turns, gracious and bullish, wry and prickly, modest and confident, the only constant the vague impression that he had considerably better things to be doing than talking to a bunch of his intellectual subordinates. Van Gaal was, essentially, being Van Gaal. - Born: Sneijder steps up for Netherlands Towards the end, conversation turned to Wesley Sneijder. The furore over Arjen Robben's confession, after victory against Mexico in the round of 16 earlier this week, that he had dived in an attempt to win a penalty on at least one occasion in that game rather overshadowed his teammate's contribution, that fierce, vital shot that screamed past Guillermo Ochoa to draw the Dutch level. That is the mark of big players, of course, that they deliver when their team needs them, that they come through in the clutch. By anybody's measure, that makes Sneijder a big player: he now has five goals in his last five World Cup knockout games. The only round he did not score in four years ago, as Netherlands finished as runners-up to Spain, was the final. Sneijder is a man for the key moments. At the same time, though, the Galatasaray midfielder had been almost entirely anonymous for the 88 minutes that preceded that perfectly struck Exocet of a shot that he produced against the Mexicans. He had created little, offered scant threat, barely influenced the narrative at all. He seemed to have disappeared when his nation needed him most. That is the thing with Sneijder. Nobody seems quite sure what they are going to get. And this is where Van Gaal's response, on Friday afternoon, was enlightening. The question was an innocuous enough one: something along the lines of how he feels the 30-year-old has performed so far. He responded by praising his leadership qualities -- "he's one of five older players leading this team" -- and insisting that there are few better than him technically. "I was not surprised by his goal," said Van Gaal. "He has this technique. If he scores from a free kick against Costa Rica, that won't surprise me. He scored five in training the other day." There was, though, something that did surprise Van Gaal. This is where his response wandered away from the banal and into the intriguing. "He arrived at our training camp," said his manager. "He was in great physical shape. I was surprised." That is the thing with Sneijder these days, it seems. Nobody is quite sure exactly what they are going to get. It is impossible not to draw the comparison to the same time four years ago, when Sneijder embarked on that remarkable run of knockout goals in South Africa. Netherlands vs. Costa Rica: July 5 (ESPN and WatchESPN) - Kuper: Dutch close in on World Cup - Steppe: Robben's transformation - Delaney: Costa Rica's run by the numbers - 50-50 Challenge: Netherlands vs. Costa Rica - Levin: Navas saves the day again and again - McIntyre: Pinto has Ticos primed Then, Sneijder -- just turning 26 -- had the world at his feet. His move to Real Madrid might not have worked out quite as well as either party had wanted, but at Internazionale he was in the form of his life. He had been a crucial part of the team that helped the club to an unprecedented domestic and European treble; in Jose Mourinho, he had finally found a coach who knew exactly how to get the best out of him. It was a strange partnership, in many ways -- the manager who demands incessant work and the playmaker with the languid style -- but they made it work. Sneijder slipped a little deeper in that Inter team than he would ordinarily play, charged with orchestrating the team's counter-attacks for a front line of Goran Pandev, Samuel Eto'o and Diego Milito. Mourinho asked him to work, of course -- there is no such thing as a free role in a Mourinho team -- but there was no resentment on the Dutchman's part. Indeed, he has described the Portuguese as "the undisputed No. 1" in the world, and even recommended that he be given the Netherlands job at one point, so sure was he of the success he would have. All of which begs the question: how did that Sneijder, the one who ranked as one of the most brilliant playmakers of his generation, become this Sneijder, the one that nobody is quite able to fathom, the one that even Van Gaal, on the eve of the tournament, suggested he may have to exclude from his squad because "one through ball every game" is not contribution enough for any member of his side? The answer seems to be found in what happened after Mourinho departed Inter. It is not a criticism of the Portuguese to suggest that he commands such loyalty in his players that he essentially salts the earth for his successor, who can never win the squad's affection. Wesley Sneijder's form can be erratic but he has proved he is a man for the key moments. So it was after the Treble with Inter, too: Rafael Benitez found a dressing room that had little hunger, little desire, a group of players who were not prepared to do anything differently, to work for anyone other than Mourinho. Whether it is because Mourinho does not plan for the future or whether it is because anyone else is a pale imitation, it is certain that it was in his departure that Inter began to drift; and with them, Sneijder. There was poor form, a spate of niggling injuries, a contractual dispute. He had offers from the Premier League, when it came time to leave Inter, but he chose Galatasaray instead: the natural inference is that he either went for money -- the Turks can offer a hugely favourable tax rate -- or for an easy life, a guaranteed place in the Champions League and a substantially less strenuous domestic campaign than he might find in one of the major leagues. “He is a player who almost needs long stretches of anonymity before he explodes into life; it is in those moments that he comes alive.” At some point along the way, Sneijder's intensity appeared to wane. He has seemed a shadow of his former self at Galatasaray. There have been continual questions about his fitness. He was signed by a fiercely ambitious club to fire them to the latter stages of the Champions League; he has struggled to make any impact at all. Perhaps he has fallen out of love with the game. The reality may be less fraught. Sneijder is a classic No. 10; that is what his game is suited to. He is a player who almost needs long stretches of anonymity before he explodes into life; it is in those moments that he comes alive. It is just that football does not have so many of those players anymore; the vast majority of attacking midfielders are expected to ferry the ball to and fro; they are expected to be comfortable defending, too, or drifting out wide. There is no better example than Germany's Toni Kroos, the very model of the modern attacking midfield player. Sneijder is far less dynamic than Kroos. His place in the firmament is uncertain. Then there is the issue of where he plays. At Galatasaray, he plays as a pure No. 10. At Inter, the finest season of his career, he was played deeper, certainly in the league. He was not there to score goals, but to create. At some point, Sneijder appears to have become confused about what he wants to do: he criticised Benitez for "playing him as a striker," but he has also complained about being asked to vacate the spot in the hole that he feels ought to be created for him. Here, then, the crux: if Sneijder does not know what sort of player he is, if football is not sure what sort of player he is, then how on earth is anyone -- even Van Gaal -- supposed to know what sort of player he is? Sneijder has always had the talent and the vision to surprise: his technique, as Van Gaal says, is flawless. The problem is that you wonder if he is now surprising himself, too.

Messi gives hope to faltering Argentina - ESPN FC	BRASILIA, Brazil -- "Argentine Invaders" proclaimed Brasilia's local freesheet on Wednesday. Lionel Messi was described as a devil, too. A truism of this World Cup for Brazilians is that the only thing worse than their team failing would be Argentine victory. The sight of blue and white camper vans is becoming very familiar on the city's dual carriageways. Having heartily celebrated beating Switzerland in Sao Paulo, convoys started arriving on Thursday afternoon. By the evening, the shopping malls, bars and commercial areas were chiming with the sound of castellano Spanish. What Brazil and Belgium fear most from Argentina in a football sense is blatantly obvious. The Messi conundrum recalls that famous Bill Shankly anecdote from 1970 when he ran down almost an entire Manchester United team -- "Paddy Crerand, now he's deceptive, he's slower than he looks," etc. -- only omitting Denis Law, George Best and Bobby Charlton and then saying: "Are you trying to tell me that you can't beat a team that's only got three players in it?" "I repeat," said a grumpy Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella at his Friday news conference in Brasilia. "Any team that has a player like Messi will greatly depend on him as a player." However, if success is to be achieved, and at this stage against a strong Belgian opponent, Sabella needs more than one star to shine, especially so when he has concerns in most areas of his team. The defence looked vulnerable against the Swiss in Sao Paulo. Had Xherdan Shaqiri had a striker worthy of the name to complement him, then Argentina would already have been facing the music in Buenos Aires. Meanwhile, in midfield -- aside from the effervescent Angel Di Maria -- Argentina continue to lack fluency and guile, while all those forwards who have played off Messi have so far failed to score. While Leo Messi has been commended for his tournament, his teammates have been chastised. Sabella must also live with an overriding belief back home that Argentina are the best team in the tournament. Nothing less than victory will do, a conceit that flies in the face of Argentina not travelling further than a quarterfinal since 1990. "It's a cultural issue," said Sabella. "It's the way we are. When I was little I always heard we were the best, but we had not yet been world champions." Sabella was 24 at the time Argentina won their first title in 1978. Now, he and his team have been doused in criticism for a lack of support to the miracles of Messi, with Claudio Caniggia, who provided able support for Diego Maradona at Italia '90, leading the charge. "We have not reached the level we want to reach," Sabella admitted. "We have won with very tight results. We are looking for an improvement." The loss of Marcos Rojo to suspension is a major concern. The Sporting Lisbon full-back, initially the subject of considerable doubt, has been a slow-burning success story. There is far less confidence in his likely replacement, Jose Maria Basanta, of Monterrey in the Mexican league. Rojo, a long-standing Liverpool target, would seem far better equipped than Basanta to deal with Eden Hazard on the left flank, or indeed when Dries Mertens or Kevin de Bruyne are switched there by Belgium coach Marc Wilmots, as he might frequently do. Sabella, perhaps by way of diversion, intimated that his lineup might closely resemble that which closed out the round-of-16 game in Sao Paulo. That could mean that Inter Milan's Rodrigo Palacio, a striker by usual trade, may line up in midfield; it was his interception from there and the pass that set up Messi to supply Di Maria's winner against the Swiss. The disappointing Fernando Gago is a most likely fall guy.

Miguel Delaney says France run out of steam in quarterfinals of World Cup - ESPN FC	RIO DE JANEIRO -- After all the talk of a repeat of 1982, Friday's match at the Maracana only ended up recalling the last few years: Germany making another World Cup semifinal (their fourth in a row); France meekly bowing out of a tournament they promised so much more in. This was a long way from the drama of that 3-3 classic -- which Germany won on penalties -- 32 years ago, and not even close to the same levels of entertainment. That was because there was one clearly superior side, who never even had to stand tall in a siege. A 1-0 final score made this game look far closer than it actually was; Germany were just never made to worry. That will be the most encouraging aspect for Joachim Low, but the most galling for France boss Didier Deschamps. As France looked for a way back into the match, there was no crescendo at the end, just a huge anticlimax. Some of the scenes with just three minutes of normal time to go were so disappointingly notable, especially given the previous games of this World Cup (see the USA against Belgium in the round of 16). But with their entire tournament teetering on the edge, France just couldn't raise the required energy. It was only Karim Benzema who showed anything like the kind of urgency that reflected the situation, and it came as no surprise that it was his shot that gave the Germans their only moment of anxiety in those oddly mundane final few minutes -- although it was easily saved by keeper Manuel Neuer. Much of that might have had to do with the suffocating conditions under the Rio sun, but it still does not feel like enough to explain why France couldn't make Low and his team feel any heat whatsoever. The joy of their play from the earlier games had seemingly evaporated and, as the Germans closed ranks, used the ball well and held them off with ease, they only looked jaded. That will be all the more frustrating because, after a World Cup that felt so dynamically different to pretty much anything from the French team in the last decade, it only ended up offering their fourth underwhelming exit in succession. In the end, when you look back in hindsight, it may not seem that different from the 2-0 quarterfinal defeat to Spain at Euro 2012. Yet if France ultimately returned to the disappointment of the last few years, Germany finally banished some of their doubts of the last few games. With Philipp Lahm restored to right-back and Sami Khedira in defensive midfield, there was much greater balance to their team, and much fewer chances being given away. This was Germany at their most polished yet, and a performance that suggested Low may be right: they may finally be ready to grow as the quality of the opposition increases. That would mark a change, and at last see them peak at the right time, particularly without the presence of the Spanish. At the same time, it should not go unnoticed that they didn't even need to be at their peak here. Germany still made errors; France illustrated their flaws at times, but never offered the conviction to suggest they could properly punish them. On repeated occasions in the first half, Germany were opened by the easiest of long balls. One such move ended with a ragged cross that still caused all manner of chaos, but Mathieu Valbuena just couldn't offer the finish. As on so many other occasions in the game, Neuer stood tall, and never needed to extend himself much. It was even notable that his forays outside his area had been toned down since the round of 16 game against Algeria brought him so much attention. Antoine Griezmann was unable to have an impact as Germany closed ranks. France couldn't go any further themselves. At the times when Germany did manage to close down the option of that over-the-top pass, Deschamps' attack didn't know where to go, and looked much less dynamic than they had done previously. Valbuena and Antoine Griezmann never offered the vigour of recent matches; they were hugely underwhelming, and it would not be outlandish to say France were a little overawed. Deschamps admitted afterwards: "Germany are accustomed to these big matches. They are a more experienced team and we were a little timid in the beginning of the match. We were not efficient. Maybe toward the end of the game, we were too exposed, but all in all, when you look at what Germany stands for and where we come from, we are frustrated. There is a massive gap between the two teams, but today we had a good game and played at a very high level." Of those who could be said to have played at a high level today, only Benzema was really trying to force the issue -- although even he could barely force a save until that final moment. At the other end, there was the simplicity with which the French defence was exposed. For all the suggestions that Germany were susceptible to set pieces, Mats Hummels shored them up at one end and opened things at the other. He got the only touch necessary for Toni Kroos' divine cross to seal what turned out to be the winner. The early goal set up their performance, and apparently set France right back. Deschamps can take encouragement from this World Cup, but not from this quarterfinal. Germany, meanwhile, can finally look forward; France couldn't expose them at the back.

Honigstein: Germany edge past France - ESPN FC	RIO DE JANEIRO -- Three thoughts from Germany's 1-0 win vs. France in the World Cup quarterfinal. 1. Low changes his mind Bastian Schweinsteiger or Sami Khedira -- there could only be one. That had been the message before and during the tournament, as Germany coach Joachim Low had to come to terms with both his regular central midfielders not being quite ready for the full exertions of a World Cup in Brazil. The job-sharing had worked reasonably well, all things considered. However, against France on Friday, Schweinsteiger and Khedira were back together in the starting lineup for the first time since October 2013 -- a 3-0 win versus Ireland in World Cup qualifying. Schweinsteiger was the deepest of Germany's central midfield trio, Toni Kroos was slightly to the left and Khedira a bit to the right. And where was the captain Philipp Lahm? The Bayern Munich man was back in his traditional right-back position. Before the game, that news was greeted with a sharp intake of air in the German section of the Maracana media centre. Having stood by his decision to field Lahm in the centre in the face of much criticism, Low did actually relent. Or was the shuffle simply a by-product of an altogether different decision? Per Mertesacker being left on the bench for Jerome Boateng made sense because Low persisted with a high defensive line -- Boateng, despite appearances, is fairly quick -- but still came as a surprise given that Mertesacker had performed well in the four prior outings. Only the Germany coach will know which of these two interconnected moves had come to him first. By doing what many people had expected of him in relation to Lahm, he had actually done the unexpected. Fielding the 36-year-old Miroslav Klose from the start in the midday Rio de Janeiro heat was another curve ball and it's hard to say whether the Lazio striker vindicated that decision. But when you win, that sort of detail ceases to matter. 2. France have the right idea but get caught early Leaving the ball and a bit of space to the Germans was an eminently sound plan from Didier Deschamps. It was a very hot day, Klose was not going to outrun anyone and France were solid enough in the middle to make Germany largely reliant on Thomas Muller's runs. The Bayern forward mostly took on Patrice Evra on the right flank but also switched positions with Mesut Ozil, who posed a different, quieter sort of threat to the back four of Les Bleus. France's main idea, meanwhile, was to exploit the space behind the high defensive line of Low's team with diagonal balls to Mathieu Valbuena -- who had France's best opportunity but saw his angled shot tipped away by Manuel Neuer -- and vertical balls to Karim Benzema. Mats Hummels, left, scored the only goal of the game in the 13th minute. The Real Madrid striker also frequently took up wider positions to create space for the central midfielders and escape the attentions of Mats Hummels and Boateng. Twice he managed to shoot at Neuer's goal, but the accuracy was lacking. When he did hit the target, in second-half stoppage time, he was denied by the German goalkeeper. Unfortunately for France, the early goal by Hummels -- Raphael Varane could have done better defensively -- made it more difficult for France to stay faithful to their reactive style. They often played the final ball too early and Germany found a bit more composure, albeit without ever having full control of proceedings. France, in turn, couldn't bring their powerful, direct game to bear because they couldn't counterattack. Leading 1-0 also made it easier for Schweinsteiger and Khedira to hold the midfield, as neither had to go forward too much to support Germany's attack. 3. Another "dirty" win for Germany Low has achieved one thing after leading the Nationalmannschaft to their fourth semifinal in the last four World Cups: nobody will accuse this Germany team of playing too much beautiful football to succeed. (That had been the suspicion in some quarters before the tournament started). Muller set the tone in an interview after the much-maligned Algeria game, where he set out his team's priorities in no uncertain terms. "If other sides win this way, they are seen as clever," the 24-year-old told Bild, "people rave about them and say they are cool dirtbags. I don't want to win the World Cup and be forced to say: Sorry that we won the final with only one goal difference." They haven't won the World Cup yet, but in the Maracana they reconnected with a trait that all trophy-winning German teams have had: they can win games without being exciting, totally dominant or aesthetically pleasing. Being a "Turniermannschaft" -- a tournament team -- is what they call that back home. Next stop: Belo Horizonte.

France tried right up until the end, said coach Didier Deschamps on loss to Germany - ESPN FC	France coach Didier Deschamps said his squad did everything possible to equalise but came up short on Friday in losing 1-0 to Germany in their World Cup quarterfinal. Germany did not give France many chances to impose the kind of attacking game that made Les Bleus one of the more exciting lineups during the group stage. Karim Benzema could have sent the game into extra time with an opportunity in stoppage time, but Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer swatted the angled shot away. "We tried everything right until the end with an opportunity to Karim Benzema but Neuer did the job," Deschamps said.  Benzema had a greater number of chances but failed to make the most of any of them. He volleyed his first sight of goal wide and that set the tone for the rest of his game. He chose the wrong option with his final shot of the game and was comfortably denied. "Germany is accustomed to these big matches," Benzema said. "They are a more experienced team and we were a little timid in the beginning of the match. We were not efficient. "Maybe toward the end of the game, we were too exposed, but all in all, when you look at what Germany stands for and where we come from, we are frustrated. There is a massive gap between the two teams, but today we had a good game and played at a very high level." With Germany's defence excellently marshalled by Mats Hummels, France needed Benzema to stretch the back four to open up space, but having been handed back a central role after being shifted out wide -- previously to accommodate Olivier Giroud -- he seemed reluctant to run the channels. Karim Benzema struggled to find opportunities for France in their quarterfinal against Germany. Benzema relied heavily on the service to make an impact, and there were few times he was put in a position to test Neuer. He even started to have the opposite effect when he took a chance off the toes of Mathieu Valbuena. "We weren't efficient on offense," Valbuena told beIN. "It's hard. We were doing magnificent things up until now and it's a pity to stop such a good streak. We gave everything but it wasn't enough." France impressed in Brazil by scoring eight goals in their first two matches, but more importantly, they also avoided the embarrassing scenes of discontent in the squad that marred their previous World Cup in South Africa. "I'm quite proud of what we've achieved so far, on the pitch as well as what's been going on behind the scenes," Deschamps said. "It's promising and we will have to keep up the momentum. I'm hurt and disappointed, but there have been a lot of positive things that have happened with this team and this is what I want to remember. "We played in a quarterfinal, so it's a good memory to take with us. We've had some interesting matches. Playing at 1 p.m., I don't think we like it less or more than the Germans. It is the same for both teams. Both teams had to adjust to the situation." Deschamps said he felt Germany had a chance to win the World Cup. "You need quality and luck as well," Deschamps said. "This German team were one of the favorites and there is no surprise. These type of players are accustomed to these big matches and this high level competition. "Sometimes you need a little luck on your side. I don't think there was a huge gap, there was very little difference between the teams."	sports
McIntyre: Los Ticos ready for another surprise - ESPN FC	SALVADOR, Brazil -- Anyone expecting the Netherlands to crush Costa Rica on Saturday afternoon is probably going to be disappointed. It seems like an audacious statement on its face. The Dutch are arguably the best team never to be crowned world champion, while the upstart Ticos come into the match already breathing rarified air, already having delivered the best performance in their tiny nation's history. Nonetheless, the new reality of the international game is there's no such thing as a mismatch anymore, especially when it comes down to the final five teams standing at a World Cup. Forget history and ignore the FIFA rankings, if you don't already; all that matters now is the next 90 (or quite possibly 120) minutes, something Oranje coach Louis van Gaal is none too aware of heading into the match. "I never said Costa Rica was a weaker team," Van Gaal said at Friday's prematch press conference, scolding journalists from his home country who had suggested otherwise. "The high number of games going to extra time shows that there are almost no differences between the teams. This is, undoubtedly, the best World Cup I've seen in the last 30 years." Costa Rica prepare for the country's first World Cup quarterfinal. Besides, it's not like his counterpart is just happy to be there. Sure, Ticos boss Jorge Luis Pinto is playing with house money now, having led his team a round of 16 victory over Greece after wins against Italy and Uruguay (plus a scoreless tie against England) in the only group in World Cup history to feature three former champions. But he's not about to fold now. "It's not easy to beat three great powers when nobody believes in us," Pinto said Friday. "But we believe in our work, in the team's preparation, in each player's dedication on the pitch. We have analyzed everything, and I know that we'll keep on going. " Why shouldn't they? It's not like the Netherlands have been totally convincing in Brazil, despite four wins from four games. Mexico was minutes away from eliminating the Dutch in the round of 16 before imploding, and Costa Rica beat and tied El Tri during qualifying this past year. Van Gaal himself conceded that the 2014 version of his national squad isn't the "Clockwork Orange" side of lore, the one that went to two finals in the 1970s or even the one that did the same in South Africa four years ago. "I've always said we're not a fantastic team," the Dutch manager admitted on the eve of the match. "But it's very difficult to defeat us." Netherlands vs. Costa Rica: July 5 (ESPN and WatchESPN) - Kuper: Dutch close in on World Cup - Steppe: Robben's transformation - Delaney: Costa Rica's run by the numbers - 50-50 Challenge: Netherlands vs. Costa Rica - Levin: Navas saves the day again and again - McIntyre: Pinto has Ticos primed That, of course, is Pinto's challenge. The Colombian has been as shrewd a manager as any in the competition to this point. None have gotten more out of less, and he knows full well the opportunity of a lifetime is staring him in the face now, no matter how many think another upset is impossible. "It is possible," he said. It could take outwitting Van Gaal, which won't be easy, but Pinto believes he has an ace up his sleeve. As a young man, one of his mentors was legendary Dutch coach Rinus Michels, the architect of those '70s-era "Total Football" teams and someone whom Pinto befriended in the early 1980s while a student in Cologne, Germany, where Michels was running the local Bundesliga club. "I've been looking at Dutch football since then," Pinto said. Star striker Bryan Ruiz also knows Saturday's opponent well, having spent two seasons in the Netherlands before moving to the Premier League in 2011 (he returned to the Eredivisie on loan with PSV Eindhoven in the second half of the 2013-14 season). All that doesn't change the fact that the Dutch remain the heavy favorite. "Our goal continues to be winning the World Cup," Van Gaal said. Costa Rica's is merely to live to fight another day. "My team is a team for challenges," Pinto said. "We've always believed." Believe this: Although the odds say the Netherlands will prevail in the end, it won't end with the rout many are predicting.

France 0-1 Germany - Mats Hummels header sends Germany into World Cup semifinals - ESPN FC	Germany secured a familiar World Cup semifinal berth with a minimum of fuss as French hopes of avenging past injustices shrivelled and died in the Maracana. This is the fourth World Cup in a row that Germany have reached the last four of the tournament, and France had little answer to Mats Hummels' 13th-minute header. Germany always looked comfortable with the slender lead and it was Joachim Low's side who came closest to scoring again before settling for a 1-0 result. This was a blow to French pride, the country remembering with bitterness semi defeats by Germany in 1982 -- which featured the infamous Harald Schumacher challenge on Patrick Battiston -- and 1986. For some reason, Didier Deschamps' side seemed strangely subdued in defeat. Even towards the final whistle there seemed little urgency. This was far from the classic that had been hoped for -- indeed, it was one of the more turgid affairs of this consistently excellent tournament. The team selections saw a trio of Arsenal players dropped to the bench: Per Mertesacker for Germany, who had been struggling with an illness, and Olivier Giroud and Laurent Koscielny for France. The significant move for Germany was captain Philipp Lahm returning to right-back rather than midfield, and it looked as though Low had his selection right, with Mamadou Sakho -- the Liverpool defender whose return from injury accounted for Koscielny missing out -- looking hesitant. But France began to make things uncomfortable for the German defence too, especially with the darting runs of Mathieu Valbuena. It was he who found Karim Benzema unmarked with plenty of time and space, but he side-footed wide when he should have scored. Germany intensified the pain of the miss in the 13th minute when Kroos' free kick was met by Hummels, outjumping Raphael Varane and steering a header over Hugo Lloris. Mesut Ozil, the one Arsenal player who did start, produced a brilliant volleyed cross to Miroslav Klose, who went sprawling in the box. Replays showed Mathieu Debuchy did have hold of Klose's shirt but an over-dramatic fall by the striker did not impress Argentinian referee Nestor Pitana. Germany failed to build on their lead, however, and it was France who finished the half on the up. Manuel Neuer produced an outstanding one-handed save from Valbuena, with Benzema unable to put home the rebound from close range as Hummels was in the way. Benzema was denied again after cutting inside but shooting straight at Neuer. Germany appeared content to play on the break and contain a more adventurous-looking France, a risky approach that almost paid off when Kroos and Ozil combined, but the Arsenal man's return ball was just cut out, then Kroos shot badly wide from 25 yards after more neat approach play. But much of Germany's midfield play was untidy, and following one such episode Debuchy's cross was met by Varane with a decent header, but Neuer held it comfortably enough. Deschamps' answer was to send on Loic Remy for Yohan Cabaye, a striker for a midfielder, but it was Germany who started to look more dangerous. Muller skimmed a shot just past the post, Andre Schurrle came off the bench to send a low drive straight at Lloris, then Ozil and Muller combined before France smuggled the ball away. A glimpse of goal for Benzema was shut down by Sami Khedira, then Blaise Matuidi had an attempt from a narrow angle easily punched clear by Neuer. A quick break by Germany ended in a couple of terrible misses. Ozil put one on a plate for Muller but he completely missed his kick before Schurrle shot weakly straight at Lloris. The last throw of the dice was for Deschamps to throw on Giroud for Valbuena -- a strange choice given that the diminutive Marseille midfielder nicknamed "petit velo" had been France's player of the tournament. Schurrle had another good opportunity blocked before Benzema's last-minute strike was turned away one-handed by the unflappable Neuer.	sports

Argentina vs. Belgium: 50-50 preview - ESPN FC	Argentina and Belgium face each other in a mouth-watering quarterfinal in Brasilia this Saturday; Sam Kelly (Argentina) and Wim Van Walle (Belgium) preview the tie. Sum up your tournament so far: SK: Underwhelming, but touched by genius. As one of the more vocal champions (in English at least) of Argentina's free-scoring, fast-flowing attack, it's also been slightly embarrassing personally, to be frank. They've looked like an entirely different side from the one which swept through the qualifiers, unable to control the game when opponents have handed them the initiative and elected to defend deep, and subsequently less than convincing so far. Lionel Messi is proving a pretty useful trump card so far, but his teammates shouldn't be relying on him anything like so much. And yet they've managed four wins out of four so far, and as I was reminded by the locals when I went out for a coffee after Tuesday's match, "we're still in it, so it's still winnable." WV: Most expected Belgium to top Group H but there was much discussion about the way they eventually did. Belgium presented themselves as a cautious, uninspired team for most of the three games, choosing to finish their opponents off in the last 20 minutes. It wasn't pretty, but it was effective. But then came the second round game against the United States. Belgium looked like a different team. They sank their teeth in the game and never, not for one minute, let go. It was a mesmerizing display of relentless, attacking football. If not for the magnificent Tim Howard, it could have ended with a monstrous score line. This is how everybody expected the Red Devils to play, or even better. Suddenly, Belgium have three players in FIFA's team of the round, more than any other country. WC history between the two countries : SK: These sides have faced each other three times in total, all coming in the 1980s. Two of those meetings were in World Cups; in the 1982 first group stage, Belgium beat the then-holders 1-0 in the tournament's opening match, in Barcelona's Camp Nou (the stadium in which Argentina's young forward, Diego Maradona, would play his club football in the following season after being transferred from Boca Juniors). Four years later in the Estadio Azteca, Maradona scored twice to give Argentina a 2-0 win and take Argentina into the final. The sides haven't met since. WV: Belgium played Argentina twice before in a World Cup. In the opening game in Spain in 1982, the then vice-European champions beat the reigning world champions 1-0, courtesy of an Erwin Vandenbergh goal that has reached legendary status in Belgium. Four years later they met in the semifinals in Mexico. Belgium saw two promising attacks ruled out for non-existent offsides before Diego Maradona did that thing he did that summer and single-handedly steered his country to a 2-0 win. The first-ever game between the two came at the Amsterdam Olympics in 1928. Argentina won 6-3. There was also a friendly in 1984 which ended in a 2-0 Argentina win. Advantage Argentina as far as history goes. What are your expectations for the rest of the tournament? SK: I really don't know, because Argentina could continue to be as stodgy as they have been so far, or they could make the necessary adjustments -- or just manage to nod in one of the numerous set pieces they keep winning early on in matches -- and open the game up, allowing them to impose their own style on proceedings again. If either of those things happen, we should see the Argentina of the qualifiers, which we caught glimpses of in their last group stage game against Nigeria. They'll be under pressure in this one, though, and also have the huge expectation of finally getting beyond the quarterfinals -- a feat they haven't managed since Italia '90, when as defending champions they were dethroned by West Germany in the final. Psychologically, there's going to be a lot of pressure. WV: It's a tough one to call. Not one of the remaining countries is significantly stronger than the rest. Belgium and Colombia were the most convincing of the second round winners and Costa Rica are the tournament's surprise package. But it would be foolish to count out Brazil, Holland, France, Germany or, for that matter, Argentina. Even if they haven't played well and were lucky to survive Switzerland, they still have the mercurial talent of Messi, who can change a game even if he only gets a few touches. But they will do well to heed Maradona's warning: they will have to play a lot better or they will be in big trouble against Belgium. Key Battle: SK: Messi vs. Vincent Kompany. In the absence of any meaningful help from his midfielders -- and given the evidence of the tournament so far, we must assume that's going to continue -- Messi will again be Argentina's team going forward, rather than just their key man. Kompany's going to get close to him, probably aided by a fellow midfielder or defender, and things will be as tight as they have been all tournament thus far, unless Argentina can finally shake off their collective lack of interest and seek to properly exploit the space that putting two men on Messi will open up elsewhere in the Belgian formation. And of course, in every one of Argentina's games so far there's been a point when, however good that shackling of Messi has been throughout, he's finally broken free and won them the game (either scoring or, as he did on Tuesday, providing the assist). Can that pattern continue here? WV: A football game is never a direct battle between a forward and a goalkeeper but here are some key statistics: Belgium are unbeaten in 21 consecutive games with Thibaut Courtois in goal. Argentina haven't lost with Messi in 24 consecutive games. And Messi hasn't scored against Courtois in seven. The great Johan Cruyff once said: "The longer a run like that goes on, the more likely it becomes that it is ended." It remains to be seen which of these runs ends on Saturday. Messi can score at will against almost any opposition but Courtois is perfectly capable of "doing a Howard". Prediction: SK: Until now Argentina's results have been easy to predict because even while playing lethargically, they've had clearly the better quality. This game is a little different. Messi's been so ruthlessly effective, though, that I think he can make the difference again. I'm going for Argentina by a goal, though very possibly not in normal time. WV: Marc Wilmots has hinted that Belgium are not the favourites for this game. "We will have to adapt to Argentina," he said. "I have a plan in my head. But then again, I wonder how Argentina will adapt to us." Belgium will do well not to change too much. The Argentinian defence is shaky at best, and Nigeria demonstrated how vulnerable they can be against high-paced football. Goalkeeper Sergio Romero doesn't exactly ooze confidence either. With six different players already on the score sheet, Belgium must take their chances from every angle. Messi may score, but Belgium will score more. 2-1 Belgium.	sports
McIntyre: Los Ticos ready for another surprise - ESPN FC	SALVADOR, Brazil -- Anyone expecting the Netherlands to crush Costa Rica on Saturday afternoon is probably going to be disappointed. It seems like an audacious statement on its face. The Dutch are arguably the best team never to be crowned world champion, while the upstart Ticos come into the match already breathing rarified air, already having delivered the best performance in their tiny nation's history. Nonetheless, the new reality of the international game is there's no such thing as a mismatch anymore, especially when it comes down to the final five teams standing at a World Cup. Forget history and ignore the FIFA rankings, if you don't already; all that matters now is the next 90 (or quite possibly 120) minutes, something Oranje coach Louis van Gaal is none too aware of heading into the match. "I never said Costa Rica was a weaker team," Van Gaal said at Friday's prematch press conference, scolding journalists from his home country who had suggested otherwise. "The high number of games going to extra time shows that there are almost no differences between the teams. This is, undoubtedly, the best World Cup I've seen in the last 30 years." Costa Rica prepare for the country's first World Cup quarterfinal. Besides, it's not like his counterpart is just happy to be there. Sure, Ticos boss Jorge Luis Pinto is playing with house money now, having led his team a round of 16 victory over Greece after wins against Italy and Uruguay (plus a scoreless tie against England) in the only group in World Cup history to feature three former champions. But he's not about to fold now. "It's not easy to beat three great powers when nobody believes in us," Pinto said Friday. "But we believe in our work, in the team's preparation, in each player's dedication on the pitch. We have analyzed everything, and I know that we'll keep on going. " Why shouldn't they? It's not like the Netherlands have been totally convincing in Brazil, despite four wins from four games. Mexico was minutes away from eliminating the Dutch in the round of 16 before imploding, and Costa Rica beat and tied El Tri during qualifying this past year. Van Gaal himself conceded that the 2014 version of his national squad isn't the "Clockwork Orange" side of lore, the one that went to two finals in the 1970s or even the one that did the same in South Africa four years ago. "I've always said we're not a fantastic team," the Dutch manager admitted on the eve of the match. "But it's very difficult to defeat us." Netherlands vs. Costa Rica: July 5 (ESPN and WatchESPN) - Kuper: Dutch close in on World Cup - Steppe: Robben's transformation - Delaney: Costa Rica's run by the numbers - 50-50 Challenge: Netherlands vs. Costa Rica - Levin: Navas saves the day again and again - McIntyre: Pinto has Ticos primed That, of course, is Pinto's challenge. The Colombian has been as shrewd a manager as any in the competition to this point. None have gotten more out of less, and he knows full well the opportunity of a lifetime is staring him in the face now, no matter how many think another upset is impossible. "It is possible," he said. It could take outwitting Van Gaal, which won't be easy, but Pinto believes he has an ace up his sleeve. As a young man, one of his mentors was legendary Dutch coach Rinus Michels, the architect of those '70s-era "Total Football" teams and someone whom Pinto befriended in the early 1980s while a student in Cologne, Germany, where Michels was running the local Bundesliga club. "I've been looking at Dutch football since then," Pinto said. Star striker Bryan Ruiz also knows Saturday's opponent well, having spent two seasons in the Netherlands before moving to the Premier League in 2011 (he returned to the Eredivisie on loan with PSV Eindhoven in the second half of the 2013-14 season). All that doesn't change the fact that the Dutch remain the heavy favorite. "Our goal continues to be winning the World Cup," Van Gaal said. Costa Rica's is merely to live to fight another day. "My team is a team for challenges," Pinto said. "We've always believed." Believe this: Although the odds say the Netherlands will prevail in the end, it won't end with the rout many are predicting.

Police detonate bag left near Maracana - ESPN FC	A member of the Brazilian bomb squad examines an area where a bag deemed suspicious was left in Rio de Janeiro on Friday. RIO DE JANEIRO -- A Brazilian bomb squad blew up a bag deemed suspicious that was left Friday near a metro station entrance close to the Maracana stadium where the World Cup game between Germany and France was underway. Journalists saw the events while authorities closed the metro station as a precaution. The Federal Police said in a statement it investigated a bomb threat near Maracana stadium but that no explosive device was found. Further details were not provided. Few people were near the metro station when the bomb squad acted because tens of thousands of fans were inside the stadium watching the game. Some surrounding roads were also closed while the bomb squad investigated. The incident lasted about 20 minutes. The metro was reopened after the bag was detonated and before Germany beat France 1-0.	sports
Netherlands vs. Costa Rica: 50-50 preview - ESPN FC	Netherlands sneaked into the quarterfinals following their late show against Mexico, while Costa Rica's fairytale continued with victory over Greece on penalties to get to this stage. Elko Born (Netherlands) and Matt Levin (Costa Rica) preview the tie. Sum up your tournament so far Elko Born: Expectations were low for Netherlands ahead of the tournament, but after victories against Spain, Chile and Mexico, that has changed. No longer able to manoeuvre themselves into the position of underdog, the Dutch will go into the quarterfinal as one of the stronger teams in the tournament. This could cause them to worry, but, while Dutch teams of the past have often reacted poorly to pressure, there is a feeling it might be different this time around. Matt Levin: The small Central American country has been the big surprise of the World Cup. The Ticos have carried the CONCACAF banner into the quarterfinals and along the way have defeated four-time tournament champions Italy and two-time champions Uruguay. That and a tie with 1966 World Cup winners England was enough for Costa Rica to top Group D. That triumph set them up in the second round with Greece and their negative football. Team captain and Fulham outcast Bryan Ruiz scored first in the 52nd minute, but a second yellow card for defender Oscar Duarte forced the Ticos to hold on for dear life the rest of the way. The Greeks equalised but would never crack goalie Keylor Navas, who played the game of his life in keeping his team alive in both regulation, overtime and penalty kicks. His teammates put on a clinic in the spot kicks, nailing all five attempts and sending La Sele to the World Cup quarterfinals for the first time ever. World Cup history between the two countries  EB: Netherlands have never faced Costa Rica before. The only player the Dutch will certainly be familiar with is Costa Rica's star man Ruiz, who has played for FC Twente and PSV Eindhoven in the Dutch Eredivisie. ML: Due to Costa Rica's limited World Cup history, these teams have never met before in a senior-level match. However, serious Tico fans do recall their country's 3-1 victory over the Netherlands at the Under-20 World Cup in Argentina in 2001. None of the players on that Costa Rican squad are on the current roster in Brazil, but the Dutch side did include 17-year-olds Arjen Robben and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, and, indeed, Louis van Gaal was the manager at the time. So those are three members of the Dutch team who knew the Ticos were capable of major upsets long before the World Cup started. What are your expectations for the rest of the tournament? EB: The tournament has seen Netherlands go through the high of putting five past Spain to the low of facing seemingly certain elimination against Mexico. So far, it has truly been a roller-coaster ride. But having come this far, the Dutch will now want to see things through all the way to the end. Especially after their hard-fought comeback against Mexico, there is a feeling in the country that fortune is on Netherlands' side. This time around, everything seems to be going right for Oranje, even when they seem to be going wrong. ML: Some fans seemed relieved to avoid hated rivals Mexico in the quarterfinals. For all the success Costa Rica have had in Brazil, supporters still didn't want their greatest nemesis to have the chance to eliminate them. Plus, the Netherlands seem like a more worthy opponent to potentially lose to, and the Dutch might just be the tournament favourite at this point. The Ticos don't seem to be backing down from the challenge that awaits them in the quarterfinals, but Costa Rica have plenty to overcome if they're going to shock the Dutch. Yellow cards and injuries are piling up. Exhaustion will be a factor, too, after the team went the distance against Greece. Yet La Sele will hope for more scorching weather in Salvador de Bahia. The Netherlands suffered in the sun against Mexico in the round of 16, while the Ticos have used the Brazilian humidity to their advantage against their European opponents. No matter what happens the rest of the way in Brazil, the team will return home as superstars. They've already accomplished the greatest performance in Costa Rica football history. Arjen Robben and the Netherlands hope to leap past another CONCACAF side in Saturday's quarterfinal versus Costa Rica. Key battle EB: Robin van Persie, Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder have shown they can be relied upon for goals, and so victory should be within reach for the Dutch, as long as they can prevent their opponents from scoring. On Costa Rica's side, goals are most likely to come from frontman Ruiz, who found the net against Italy and Greece. Netherlands' defenders, who might remember Ruiz from his time at FC Twente and PSV Eindhoven, must therefore do whatever it takes to neutralise the Costa Rica attacker. Expect Ron Vlaar to be picked as the man to fulfil this task. ML: Robben and van Persie versus Costa Rica's defence. This is the scariest attack Costa Rica's impressive back line have faced all tournament -- and they'll likely confront the Netherlands with newcomer Johnny Acosta at centre-back. The Costa Rica national league veteran represents quite the drop-off in talent from Duarte (suspended) and his backup Roy Miller (injured). Nevertheless, this team's World Cup run has been more about players working together in coach Jorge Luis Pinto's system than individual talent. That's why the Ticos have been able to shut down Italy's Mario Balotelli and England's Daniel Sturridge, among other top strikers. The health of Navas -- who's dealing with a shoulder injury -- will be paramount for La Sele. Also worth noting is the meeting of the minds on the sidelines. Costa Rica's Pinto and the Netherlands' Van Gaal have been perhaps the two best managers in Brazil. Pinto's excellent game planning prepared his team to outplay former World Cup champions. Van Gaal, the newly anointed head of Manchester United, turned the Oranje from a popular group-stage upset pick to a team on course for their second consecutive World Cup final. Prediction EB: Costa Rica might manage to score once, but if they do, the Dutch will score twice. I expect Netherlands to win 2-1 and reach the last four. ML: 3-1 Netherlands. The hotter the temperature in Salvador, the better the Ticos' chance to slow the Dutch. Even though the Netherlands shouldn't expect to cakewalk into the semifinals, this feels like the end of Costa Rica's Cinderella run.	sports

Netherlands vs. Costa Rica: 50-50 preview - ESPN FC	Netherlands sneaked into the quarterfinals following their late show against Mexico, while Costa Rica's fairytale continued with victory over Greece on penalties to get to this stage. Elko Born (Netherlands) and Matt Levin (Costa Rica) preview the tie. Sum up your tournament so far Elko Born: Expectations were low for Netherlands ahead of the tournament, but after victories against Spain, Chile and Mexico, that has changed. No longer able to manoeuvre themselves into the position of underdog, the Dutch will go into the quarterfinal as one of the stronger teams in the tournament. This could cause them to worry, but, while Dutch teams of the past have often reacted poorly to pressure, there is a feeling it might be different this time around. Matt Levin: The small Central American country has been the big surprise of the World Cup. The Ticos have carried the CONCACAF banner into the quarterfinals and along the way have defeated four-time tournament champions Italy and two-time champions Uruguay. That and a tie with 1966 World Cup winners England was enough for Costa Rica to top Group D. That triumph set them up in the second round with Greece and their negative football. Team captain and Fulham outcast Bryan Ruiz scored first in the 52nd minute, but a second yellow card for defender Oscar Duarte forced the Ticos to hold on for dear life the rest of the way. The Greeks equalised but would never crack goalie Keylor Navas, who played the game of his life in keeping his team alive in both regulation, overtime and penalty kicks. His teammates put on a clinic in the spot kicks, nailing all five attempts and sending La Sele to the World Cup quarterfinals for the first time ever. World Cup history between the two countries  EB: Netherlands have never faced Costa Rica before. The only player the Dutch will certainly be familiar with is Costa Rica's star man Ruiz, who has played for FC Twente and PSV Eindhoven in the Dutch Eredivisie. ML: Due to Costa Rica's limited World Cup history, these teams have never met before in a senior-level match. However, serious Tico fans do recall their country's 3-1 victory over the Netherlands at the Under-20 World Cup in Argentina in 2001. None of the players on that Costa Rican squad are on the current roster in Brazil, but the Dutch side did include 17-year-olds Arjen Robben and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, and, indeed, Louis van Gaal was the manager at the time. So those are three members of the Dutch team who knew the Ticos were capable of major upsets long before the World Cup started. What are your expectations for the rest of the tournament? EB: The tournament has seen Netherlands go through the high of putting five past Spain to the low of facing seemingly certain elimination against Mexico. So far, it has truly been a roller-coaster ride. But having come this far, the Dutch will now want to see things through all the way to the end. Especially after their hard-fought comeback against Mexico, there is a feeling in the country that fortune is on Netherlands' side. This time around, everything seems to be going right for Oranje, even when they seem to be going wrong. ML: Some fans seemed relieved to avoid hated rivals Mexico in the quarterfinals. For all the success Costa Rica have had in Brazil, supporters still didn't want their greatest nemesis to have the chance to eliminate them. Plus, the Netherlands seem like a more worthy opponent to potentially lose to, and the Dutch might just be the tournament favourite at this point. The Ticos don't seem to be backing down from the challenge that awaits them in the quarterfinals, but Costa Rica have plenty to overcome if they're going to shock the Dutch. Yellow cards and injuries are piling up. Exhaustion will be a factor, too, after the team went the distance against Greece. Yet La Sele will hope for more scorching weather in Salvador de Bahia. The Netherlands suffered in the sun against Mexico in the round of 16, while the Ticos have used the Brazilian humidity to their advantage against their European opponents. No matter what happens the rest of the way in Brazil, the team will return home as superstars. They've already accomplished the greatest performance in Costa Rica football history. Arjen Robben and the Netherlands hope to leap past another CONCACAF side in Saturday's quarterfinal versus Costa Rica. Key battle EB: Robin van Persie, Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder have shown they can be relied upon for goals, and so victory should be within reach for the Dutch, as long as they can prevent their opponents from scoring. On Costa Rica's side, goals are most likely to come from frontman Ruiz, who found the net against Italy and Greece. Netherlands' defenders, who might remember Ruiz from his time at FC Twente and PSV Eindhoven, must therefore do whatever it takes to neutralise the Costa Rica attacker. Expect Ron Vlaar to be picked as the man to fulfil this task. ML: Robben and van Persie versus Costa Rica's defence. This is the scariest attack Costa Rica's impressive back line have faced all tournament -- and they'll likely confront the Netherlands with newcomer Johnny Acosta at centre-back. The Costa Rica national league veteran represents quite the drop-off in talent from Duarte (suspended) and his backup Roy Miller (injured). Nevertheless, this team's World Cup run has been more about players working together in coach Jorge Luis Pinto's system than individual talent. That's why the Ticos have been able to shut down Italy's Mario Balotelli and England's Daniel Sturridge, among other top strikers. The health of Navas -- who's dealing with a shoulder injury -- will be paramount for La Sele. Also worth noting is the meeting of the minds on the sidelines. Costa Rica's Pinto and the Netherlands' Van Gaal have been perhaps the two best managers in Brazil. Pinto's excellent game planning prepared his team to outplay former World Cup champions. Van Gaal, the newly anointed head of Manchester United, turned the Oranje from a popular group-stage upset pick to a team on course for their second consecutive World Cup final. Prediction EB: Costa Rica might manage to score once, but if they do, the Dutch will score twice. I expect Netherlands to win 2-1 and reach the last four. ML: 3-1 Netherlands. The hotter the temperature in Salvador, the better the Ticos' chance to slow the Dutch. Even though the Netherlands shouldn't expect to cakewalk into the semifinals, this feels like the end of Costa Rica's Cinderella run.	sports

Lionel Messi will have to do better against Thibaut Courtois writes Miguel Delaney - ESPN FC	It is a sight every goalkeeper in the world fears, and the vast majority have ultimately failed to deal with: Lionel Messi bearing down on your goal, ready to distil all that talent into one decisive moment. For Asmir Begovic, it was an assault on the senses as much as his goal. "You can feel the pace of his play, the power he has. We tried to get two or three people around him every time he got the ball, but he shook everyone off." That goal against Bosnia and Herzegovina, which sealed a 2-1 victory for Argentina in their opening game, ignited Messi's World Cup campaign. Since then, he has completely banished so many pre-tournament debates about his World Cup legacy, while consistently breaking supposedly psychological barriers and reaching new landmarks. On Saturday, another significant block presents itself, and it is a literal one that may yet prevent Argentina from reaching the World Cup semifinals for the first time since 1990. It also represents something of an inversion of all the old debate surrounding his international career, since it is one area he has struggled with in club football. That is the daunting physical presence of Thibaut Courtois. Messi has not scored against the Atletico Madrid goalkeeper since December 2012, a drought that has now extended to seven games. Those seven matches also played a major part in ensuring the Barcelona creator last season suffered the first trophy-less campaign of his career since 2007-08. Messi has been largely unable to beat Courtois but how much of that is down to the goalkeeper? Now, in goal for Belgium, Courtois is the most immediate obstacle to Messi getting his hands on the trophy he desires above all else. To complete his legacy with the World Cup itself, the 27-year-old is likely going to have finish past the Belgian. "I know very well how to play against Messi," Courtois said this week. "We have come up against each other in various games between Atletico and Barcelona, although on those occasions the defeats were not his fault. Messi is a sensational player. He can decide a game in a second." Courtois has accumulated many minutes against Messi, which has meant he doesn't have to prepare in the usual way. That wouldn't exactly help anyway, however, since Messi is not a usual player. "The good thing is I don't have to watch videos of him because I know him so well," Courtois explained. "But, even if you watch videos of him, he's so unpredictable that it's impossible to study him to know what he's going to do. As soon as he finds a way to shoot, he will shoot, so the only thing you can do as a goalkeeper is concentrate at all times." The duel has already taken on other dimensions, given that it was Belgium that Argentina met on the way to the 1986 World Cup and saw Diego Maradona score another of those iconic goals. In truth, however, there also other dimensions to this battle right now. It is obviously much more than a mere mental block as Courtois indicated by saying it isn't all Messi's fault, effectively admitting it isn't all down to his goalkeeping. Messi's superb form at the 2014 World Cup gives him a good chance of pulling Argentina to victory. Most obviously, there was the defensive system set up by Diego Simeone at Atletico. It was widely praised in each of those seven games, generally seen as the primary reason for preventing Messi scoring. It wasn't quite that the No. 10 couldn't beat Courtois; it was that he couldn't get near enough to really try. Simeone's four-man blockade didn't allow Messi to work himself into those positions for his most productive shooting. You only have to look at the stats. In seven games, Messi had 16 shots, but only three were on target. As such, it wasn't really Courtois miraculously keeping out a siege. He may have to on Saturday, however, if Belgium don't set up a similar blockade. "It will be tough," Courtois said. "To hold on in defence, we must be very well-organised." This is perhaps the true intrigue to this quarterfinal: how both teams set up. Belgium finally looked liberated against the USA and possess the pace on the break to finally hurt Argentina. Courtois also referenced this. "Argentina have a very good attack, which does not just depend on Messi," the goalkeeper said, "but at the back they are not so strong. That is where we can do them damage."

Although Argentina have not been firing in attack, it might ignite them if a team suddenly offers up the space so often obstructed. That has been one primary reason Alejandro Sabella's side have not looked their best. None of the four teams they have played -- Bosnia-Herzegovina, Iran, Nigeria and Switzerland -- have been willing to step up. So Belgian manager Marc Wilmots has a decision to make. One thing is certain: given Messi's form, Wilmots absolutely must replicate Switzerland and Atletico in forming some kind of tactic to shuttle the playmaker out of the game. Thereafter, it will be revealing to see whether Sabella goes so gung ho in response. Given Belgium's own attack, the Argentina coach may seek to revert to the 5-3-2 used by Bosnia and Herzegovina that initially so isolated Messi. It would be ironic, yet it could also be the key to ending another trend, and offering a new sight: Messi finally finishing past Courtois in a match that really matters.

Marcotti: Romelu Lukaku and Kevin De Bruyne are taking their second chances - ESPN FC	The nice thing about being young, talented and rich is that this game affords you second chances. You just need a bit of patience and self-belief. They'll come and then, it's up to you to take them. Romelu Lukaku and Kevin de Bruyne are the double act that sunk Jurgen Klinsmann's United States on Tuesday. They'll get a shot at doing the same to Lionel Messi's Argentina on Saturday (though Lukaku is not guaranteed to start). - Miguel Delaney: Messi vs. Courtois - Pablo Torre: Courtois can shock Argentina - John Brewin: Messi gives flagging Argentina hope - Tim Vickery: Messi aims to emulate Maradona '86 De Bruyne turned 23 last week, Lukaku 21 in May. Yet even in their brief careers they've had ups and downs worthy of Space Mountain. And, ironically, both of their dips have coincided with crossing the same guy: Jose Mourinho. Both were precocious talents who made their Belgian league debuts early. De Bruyne was 17 when he first featured for Genk. Lukaku was just 16 years and 11 days old when he came on for Anderlecht in the playoff for the Belgian league title against Standard. Lukaku and De Bruyne both struggled at Chelsea but are thriving for Belgium. Both were acquired by Chelsea for a combined fee somewhere north of $35 million; Lukaku in August 2011, De Bruyne in January 2012 (though Chelsea allowed him to finish out the season with Genk). Between them, they've been Chelsea players for five seasons. Incredibly, they've combined for just three Premier League starts (two for De Bruyne, one for Lukaku) in that time. One way or another, they simply haven't fit in at the Stamford Bridge club. Lukaku had a rough debut season -- to be fair, he was competing for playing time with Didier Drogba, Nicolas Anelka, Salomon Kalou and Fernando Torres -- and was then loaned out first to West Brom, where he notched 17 league goals, and then, this past year, to Everton where he racked up 15. Argentina vs. Belgium: July 5 (ESPN and WatchESPN) - Van Walle: Belgian belief continues to grow - Laurens: Spotlight on Divock Origi - Macintosh: Player stocks, who's rising? - 50-50 Challenge: Argentina vs. Belgium - Five Aside: Group winners roll into quarters - Summer Transfers: Belgians are talk of town De Bruyne arrived at the end of the 2011-12 campaign and was packed off almost straight away to Werder Bremen. He returned in the summer of 2013 and the season started brightly as he featured in three of Chelsea's first five league matches. Then he disappeared from the matchday squad, reappearing only long enough to be sold to Wolfsburg in January. Mourinho accused De Bruyne of not working hard enough. Lukaku also endured barbs from the Special One, who suggested in November that the Belgian striker had misled fans about his desire to stay at the club. Lukaku is still a Chelsea player, though for how much longer remains to be seen. His contract expires in 2016 and if he doesn't extend his deal -- and, frankly, why would he want to? -- he'll likely be sold or loaned out again. It's not surprising per se that two players capable of powering their country to a World Cup quarterfinal should be such marginal figures at the club that actually owned them. It is somewhat perplexing that neither got a serious look-in. (And, no, you can't blame it all on Mourinho either.) De Bruyne has been trusted to play a crucial role for Belgium and so far, he's repaid that faith. In some ways, they epitomize the state of the modern game and the issue of big clubs stockpiling talent. At times it feels as if the big boys, thanks to their enormous financial advantage, simply chuck as much as they can against the wall and see what sticks. If they mature quickly enough to have an immediate impact, then great. If not, you sell them off and because you've used your economic clout to cherry pick the best talent out there, odds are you won't make too big a loss. In fact, with these two, Chelsea are laughing all the way to their local financial institution. De Bruyne moved for $25 million -- more than twice what Chelsea paid for him. Lukaku should comfortably fetch somewhere north of $40 million (possibly considerably more) provided he either extends his contract or is sold this summer. Great business, return approaching 100 percent; a masterstroke by Chelsea. Or was it? It probably was. From the players' perspective though, you're not so sure. For De Bruyne, what must it have felt like back in December when your own manager was talking you down? Would you get a shot at the World Cup? What if the criticism was going to be enough to sink your move? Lukaku's done nothing but score goals for club and country despite failing to impress Mourinho. Same goes for Lukaku. It's great to bang in goals at Everton and West Brom but you're a Chelsea player and it's being made clear to you there is no future at Stamford Bridge for you. At least under the current regime. And -- let's be clear -- it's not as if Mourinho is doing this because he's petty or spiteful. His job is to put Chelsea in the best possible position to succeed and if he genuinely believed that these two don't fit the bill -- remember, he felt the same way about Juan Mata and David Luiz, it's not personal -- he has every right to do what he believes is best. After all, it's him on the line if things don't work out. Still, it's one thing to have your ability questioned. But when it's your work ethic or character that's under scrutiny, well... that's a lot to take on board at such a young age. Belgium has offered respite. Coach Marc Wilmots trusted De Bruyne with a role in the No. 10 hole (and, lest we forget, he has a certain Eden Hazard who can -- and has -- played that position to much acclaim while at Lille) and he has repaid that confidence. Christian Benteke's injury paved the way for Lukaku and while his first two outings were disappointing (a lingering ankle problem hasn't helped matters), you feel he's ready to regain his spot in the lineup. Second chances: if you're young enough and hungry enough, this game will offer you plenty. It's up to you to seize them and these two look to be doing just that.

Gabriele Marcotti previews the quarterfinals of the World Cup - ESPN FC	Two days without games. Withdrawal symptoms yet? I know I got them. But I also know that after 19 days of adrenaline, white knuckles, the impossible and the incredible, maybe what FIFA calls "rest days" are in order. We have our Elite Eight and for the first time in World Cup history, all eight teams happen to be group winners. Does that mean anything? I'm not sure. Because in all eight games -- even those that were distinctly one-sided in terms of performance -- you could easily and plausibly construct an alternate reality, a parallel universe where we end up with eight different quarterfinalists. What if Mauricio Pinilla's shot had been a quarter of an inch lower? (After the tattoo he got, he'll be reminded of it every day.) What if David Ospina hadn't pulled off that string of late saves to negate Uruguay's frenetic siege? (And while we're at it, what if Luis Suarez had been there because the thought of biting an opponent -- sorry, the collision that resulted in Giorgio Chiellini suffering "the physical result of a bite" -- had never crossed his mind?) What if Pedro Proenca hadn't given that Arjen Robben penalty in the fourth minute of stoppage time versus Mexico? What if Keylor Navas hadn't saved everything in sight during extra-time against Greece? What if France's Blaise Matuidi had been sent off for that tackle on Nigeria's Ogenyi Onazi, and what if Vincent Enyeama hadn't capped his goalkeeping master class with two uncharacteristic blunders? What if Islam Slimani hadn't been offside when he nailed that Robin van Persie-sque header against Germany? What if Blerim Dzemaili's header had been a sliver to the right? (And what if, rather than teeing up Angel Di Maria, Lionel Messi had elected to shoot?) And finally, what if Chris Wondolowski ... well, you probably know the rest. James Rodriguez is a breakout star at this World Cup. But can he lead Colombia to victory vs. Brazil? This is not to say that the quarterfinalists are not deserving. They are. The fact that they're group winners and the fact that most of the teams that advanced were also more attacking, more proactive and created more chances than their opponents is something to be celebrated. These eight teams went out and played; they didn't sit and rely on fortune, happenstance and opposition errors to get a result, as we've seen too often in the past. Not one of the round of 16 games could really be described as a "smash-and-grab" -- one of those ties in which a team gets pounded for 90 minutes and then nicks a result. Yet at the same time each of the round of 16 losers, with one or two breaks going their way, could be in the quarterfinals right now. And while (had that happened) we may have considered some of them upsets, generally there wouldn't be anything scandalous or absurd about it. Even the USA, perhaps the most outplayed in the round of 16, enjoyed at least three crystal-clear opportunities to either win or take it to penalties late in the game. France vs. Germany: July 4, noon ET (ESPN and WatchESPN) - Honigstein: Ozil, Gotze must deliver - Report: Low defends Lahm, Ozil - Laurens: France team a picture of harmony - 50-50 Challenge: France vs. Germany - Photo Gallery: Top 10 2014 World Cup moments - Elephant Oracle: Germany will beat France One upshot of this is that we haven't seen anyone play consistently well over all four games. The closest you come is perhaps France or Colombia, though they too have had their scares. I don't think it's a bad thing; it only shows how competitive this field has been. Fans are getting their money's worth; there's no question about that. The really big stars -- Messi and Neymar -- have lived up to the billing (Cristiano Ronaldo less so, but you can blame it on injury and lack of a supporting cast), and that matters. Though all eight group winners are still in, small margins like Mauricio Pinilla's misses vs. Brazil could have swung things dramatically. We've seen some stellar goalkeeping performances (Guillermo Ochoa, Navas, Tim Howard) and some abject ones too (Igor Akinfeev, Iker Casillas, Stipe Pletikosa). We've had so much of the pre-tournament conventional wisdom go out the window. The expectation was that the midday and afternoon kickoffs in places like Recife, Fortaleza, Manaus, Natal and Salvador would lead to slower-tempo, more tactical and more defensive games. Not so. The play, with very few exceptions, has been lively and pacey and, if anything, matches have been more open than in past tournaments. The conditions did take a lot out of the players, yes ... but, equally, the players stepped it up and willed their way to the next physical level, leaving everything inside them on the pitch. (Figuratively and -- in the case of Jan Vertonghen's vomit after the USA game -- literally as well.) Taken as a whole, the officiating has been pretty good as well. Take away the first few days of the competition (Brazil's penalty against Croatia, some of the offside goals for Mexico against Cameroon), perhaps the Robben penalty (which still divides opinion) and a few others (Joel Campbell not winning a spot kick for Costa Rica vs. Italy, Bosnia's disallowed goal vs. Nigeria, Hulk not getting that first-half penalty against Chile) and it's been pretty smooth sailing. Referees will always make mistakes because they're flesh and blood. The best you can do is pick the ones who make the fewest errors, hope that these errors don't influence outcomes too much and that officials show personality. That is generally what has happened. Beyond the decisions, they're to be commended for allowing games to flow -- there have been substantially fewer fouls in this World Cup than there were four years ago -- without boiling over into nastiness. Brazil vs. Colombia: July 4, 4 ET (ESPN and WatchESPN) - Duarte: Neymar deals with the pressure - Lang: No plan B for Brazil - ESPN FC: Colombia eager to face Brazil - 50-50 Challenge: Brazil vs. Colombia - Kaka: "Brazil has not convinced yet" - Carter: Golden Boot countdown Ugliness? Yeah, we've had some -- Suarez's bite above all. The fact that the FIFA congress wouldn't consider something as logical as term limits; not just that, but the pathetic way some delegates fawned over Sepp Blatter -- age discrimination! Nobody will take away our president! The leader is good, the leader is great, we surrender our will as of this date! Ticketless fans forcing their way into stadiums on at least two occasions. The bonus controversies with some teams, punctuated by that horrid image of John Boye kissing his huge wad of cash. But again, relative to the past, it's been rather minor. So what now? Now we sit and hope that the last seven games (yes, seven, because nobody gives a hoot about the the third-place playoff) live up to what we've seen before. And we pray for a clean finish. France vs. Germany, Belo Horizonte (Friday, noon ET, ESPN2/WatchESPN) Those stereotypes about German efficiency and solidity ought to have been buried a long, long time ago. Algeria scared the bejesus out of them -- thanks also to Joachim Low's outrageously high line -- and France on the counter are devastating. Les Bleus' midfield also matches up very well against the German possession game. If you believe in patterns and superstitions (1998 and 2006 vs. 1994, 2002 and 2010) the French may be due. Brazil vs. Colombia (Friday, 4pm ET, ESPN/WatchESPN) James versus Neymar: could this be the next great rivalry, once Messi and Cristiano hang up their boots? Let's not get carried away here, but it's an intriguing parallel. Neither seems fazed. Colombia's absurd speed will keep Brazil tied up; the main question is whether Luiz Felipe Scolari finds the right mix to support Neymar and take on a back four that doesn't quite appear to be watertight. Messi's form in Brazil has been stellar. Can Belgium shut him down? Argentina vs. Belgium (Saturday, noon ET, ABC/WatchESPN) Marc Wilmots was bullish to the point of being bombastic after the USA game (Worry about Messi? Let them worry about us!). You can't blame him for being enthusiastic -- getting stronger as the tournament progresses is huge. Argentina meanwhile (Messi aside) aren't always pretty, and none other than Diego Maradona (not that he'd have an axe to grind or anything) has been very critical. Simply put: you can't rely on a Messi master class every game. The others have to show up, particularly in the attacking third. Netherlands vs. Costa Rica (Saturday, 4pm ET, ESPN/WatchESPN) The last thing Louis van Gaal wants to do is play this game "on paper." "On paper," the Dutch should have stomped all over Australia; instead, Tim Cahill and his mates gave them the scare of a lifetime. Van Gaal will need to rejigger his team without Nigel de Jong (something he's done every game anyway) and get the real van Persie back. Costa Rica have shown they're no pushovers, though that high line against Robben and possibly Memphis Depay will look mighty tasty to the Dutch. Especially since Oscar Duarte is suspended.

Messi gives hope to faltering Argentina - ESPN FC	BRASILIA, Brazil -- "Argentine Invaders" proclaimed Brasilia's local freesheet on Wednesday. Lionel Messi was described as a devil, too. A truism of this World Cup for Brazilians is that the only thing worse than their team failing would be Argentine victory. The sight of blue and white camper vans is becoming very familiar on the city's dual carriageways. Having heartily celebrated beating Switzerland in Sao Paulo, convoys started arriving on Thursday afternoon. By the evening, the shopping malls, bars and commercial areas were chiming with the sound of castellano Spanish. What Brazil and Belgium fear most from Argentina in a football sense is blatantly obvious. The Messi conundrum recalls that famous Bill Shankly anecdote from 1970 when he ran down almost an entire Manchester United team -- "Paddy Crerand, now he's deceptive, he's slower than he looks," etc. -- only omitting Denis Law, George Best and Bobby Charlton and then saying: "Are you trying to tell me that you can't beat a team that's only got three players in it?" "I repeat," said a grumpy Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella at his Friday news conference in Brasilia. "Any team that has a player like Messi will greatly depend on him as a player." However, if success is to be achieved, and at this stage against a strong Belgian opponent, Sabella needs more than one star to shine, especially so when he has concerns in most areas of his team. The defence looked vulnerable against the Swiss in Sao Paulo. Had Xherdan Shaqiri had a striker worthy of the name to complement him, then Argentina would already have been facing the music in Buenos Aires. Meanwhile, in midfield -- aside from the effervescent Angel Di Maria -- Argentina continue to lack fluency and guile, while all those forwards who have played off Messi have so far failed to score. While Leo Messi has been commended for his tournament, his teammates have been chastised. Sabella must also live with an overriding belief back home that Argentina are the best team in the tournament. Nothing less than victory will do, a conceit that flies in the face of Argentina not travelling further than a quarterfinal since 1990. "It's a cultural issue," said Sabella. "It's the way we are. When I was little I always heard we were the best, but we had not yet been world champions." Sabella was 24 at the time Argentina won their first title in 1978. Now, he and his team have been doused in criticism for a lack of support to the miracles of Messi, with Claudio Caniggia, who provided able support for Diego Maradona at Italia '90, leading the charge. "We have not reached the level we want to reach," Sabella admitted. "We have won with very tight results. We are looking for an improvement." The loss of Marcos Rojo to suspension is a major concern. The Sporting Lisbon full-back, initially the subject of considerable doubt, has been a slow-burning success story. There is far less confidence in his likely replacement, Jose Maria Basanta, of Monterrey in the Mexican league. Rojo, a long-standing Liverpool target, would seem far better equipped than Basanta to deal with Eden Hazard on the left flank, or indeed when Dries Mertens or Kevin de Bruyne are switched there by Belgium coach Marc Wilmots, as he might frequently do. Sabella, perhaps by way of diversion, intimated that his lineup might closely resemble that which closed out the round-of-16 game in Sao Paulo. That could mean that Inter Milan's Rodrigo Palacio, a striker by usual trade, may line up in midfield; it was his interception from there and the pass that set up Messi to supply Di Maria's winner against the Swiss. The disappointing Fernando Gago is a most likely fall guy. Argentina vs. Belgium: July 5 (ESPN and WatchESPN) - Van Walle: Belgian belief continues to grow - Laurens: Spotlight on Divock Origi - Macintosh: Player stocks, who's rising? - 50-50 Challenge: Argentina vs. Belgium - Five Aside: Group winners roll into quarters - Summer Transfers: Belgians are talk of town Central defender Federico Fernandez's performances so far, and especially in Sao Paulo, leave him on the chopping block for much of the Argentine media -- in favour of Manchester City warrior Martin Demichelis. "We have great confidence because he has always given good results in general terms," said Sabella, a dealer in faint praise of Fernandez. Which leaves the forwards. Sergio Aguero, Messi's friend and favourite foil, is only likely to play from the bench against Belgium, if at all. "He's doing quite well so we'll see how he responds to see if he can be part of the 23 on the bench," said Sabella of a striker hampered by injury after suffering the recurrence of the hamstring problem he first suffered at Tottenham in January. Aguero's absence places further pressure on Gonzalo Higuain, who has suffered a dreadful tournament so far, although Sabella has made allowances. "He was the player who ran the most," he said of the Napoli striker's performance against Switzerland. "He tries to cooperate in occupying the spaces." Such talk of occupation of space is part of there being almost zero pretence about Argentina's team servicing one man. "There's a team that makes him stronger and makes him feel well," said Sabella, praising his other charges' assistance in helping Messi shine for the first time at a World Cup. "Four years ago he was heavily criticised. Now we say that we greatly depend on Messi."	sports
Argentina vs. Belgium: 50-50 preview - ESPN FC	Argentina and Belgium face each other in a mouth-watering quarterfinal in Brasilia this Saturday; Sam Kelly (Argentina) and Wim Van Walle (Belgium) preview the tie. Sum up your tournament so far: SK: Underwhelming, but touched by genius. As one of the more vocal champions (in English at least) of Argentina's free-scoring, fast-flowing attack, it's also been slightly embarrassing personally, to be frank. They've looked like an entirely different side from the one which swept through the qualifiers, unable to control the game when opponents have handed them the initiative and elected to defend deep, and subsequently less than convincing so far. Lionel Messi is proving a pretty useful trump card so far, but his teammates shouldn't be relying on him anything like so much. And yet they've managed four wins out of four so far, and as I was reminded by the locals when I went out for a coffee after Tuesday's match, "we're still in it, so it's still winnable." WV: Most expected Belgium to top Group H but there was much discussion about the way they eventually did. Belgium presented themselves as a cautious, uninspired team for most of the three games, choosing to finish their opponents off in the last 20 minutes. It wasn't pretty, but it was effective. But then came the second round game against the United States. Belgium looked like a different team. They sank their teeth in the game and never, not for one minute, let go. It was a mesmerizing display of relentless, attacking football. If not for the magnificent Tim Howard, it could have ended with a monstrous score line. This is how everybody expected the Red Devils to play, or even better. Suddenly, Belgium have three players in FIFA's team of the round, more than any other country. WC history between the two countries : SK: These sides have faced each other three times in total, all coming in the 1980s. Two of those meetings were in World Cups; in the 1982 first group stage, Belgium beat the then-holders 1-0 in the tournament's opening match, in Barcelona's Camp Nou (the stadium in which Argentina's young forward, Diego Maradona, would play his club football in the following season after being transferred from Boca Juniors). Four years later in the Estadio Azteca, Maradona scored twice to give Argentina a 2-0 win and take Argentina into the final. The sides haven't met since. WV: Belgium played Argentina twice before in a World Cup. In the opening game in Spain in 1982, the then vice-European champions beat the reigning world champions 1-0, courtesy of an Erwin Vandenbergh goal that has reached legendary status in Belgium. Four years later they met in the semifinals in Mexico. Belgium saw two promising attacks ruled out for non-existent offsides before Diego Maradona did that thing he did that summer and single-handedly steered his country to a 2-0 win. The first-ever game between the two came at the Amsterdam Olympics in 1928. Argentina won 6-3. There was also a friendly in 1984 which ended in a 2-0 Argentina win. Advantage Argentina as far as history goes. What are your expectations for the rest of the tournament? SK: I really don't know, because Argentina could continue to be as stodgy as they have been so far, or they could make the necessary adjustments -- or just manage to nod in one of the numerous set pieces they keep winning early on in matches -- and open the game up, allowing them to impose their own style on proceedings again. If either of those things happen, we should see the Argentina of the qualifiers, which we caught glimpses of in their last group stage game against Nigeria. They'll be under pressure in this one, though, and also have the huge expectation of finally getting beyond the quarterfinals -- a feat they haven't managed since Italia '90, when as defending champions they were dethroned by West Germany in the final. Psychologically, there's going to be a lot of pressure. WV: It's a tough one to call. Not one of the remaining countries is significantly stronger than the rest. Belgium and Colombia were the most convincing of the second round winners and Costa Rica are the tournament's surprise package. But it would be foolish to count out Brazil, Holland, France, Germany or, for that matter, Argentina. Even if they haven't played well and were lucky to survive Switzerland, they still have the mercurial talent of Messi, who can change a game even if he only gets a few touches. But they will do well to heed Maradona's warning: they will have to play a lot better or they will be in big trouble against Belgium. Key Battle: SK: Messi vs. Vincent Kompany. In the absence of any meaningful help from his midfielders -- and given the evidence of the tournament so far, we must assume that's going to continue -- Messi will again be Argentina's team going forward, rather than just their key man. Kompany's going to get close to him, probably aided by a fellow midfielder or defender, and things will be as tight as they have been all tournament thus far, unless Argentina can finally shake off their collective lack of interest and seek to properly exploit the space that putting two men on Messi will open up elsewhere in the Belgian formation. And of course, in every one of Argentina's games so far there's been a point when, however good that shackling of Messi has been throughout, he's finally broken free and won them the game (either scoring or, as he did on Tuesday, providing the assist). Can that pattern continue here? WV: A football game is never a direct battle between a forward and a goalkeeper but here are some key statistics: Belgium are unbeaten in 21 consecutive games with Thibaut Courtois in goal. Argentina haven't lost with Messi in 24 consecutive games. And Messi hasn't scored against Courtois in seven. The great Johan Cruyff once said: "The longer a run like that goes on, the more likely it becomes that it is ended." It remains to be seen which of these runs ends on Saturday. Messi can score at will against almost any opposition but Courtois is perfectly capable of "doing a Howard". Prediction: SK: Until now Argentina's results have been easy to predict because even while playing lethargically, they've had clearly the better quality. This game is a little different. Messi's been so ruthlessly effective, though, that I think he can make the difference again. I'm going for Argentina by a goal, though very possibly not in normal time. WV: Marc Wilmots has hinted that Belgium are not the favourites for this game. "We will have to adapt to Argentina," he said. "I have a plan in my head. But then again, I wonder how Argentina will adapt to us." Belgium will do well not to change too much. The Argentinian defence is shaky at best, and Nigeria demonstrated how vulnerable they can be against high-paced football. Goalkeeper Sergio Romero doesn't exactly ooze confidence either. With six different players already on the score sheet, Belgium must take their chances from every angle. Messi may score, but Belgium will score more. 2-1 Belgium.	sports
France future looks bright under Didier Deschamps despite 2014 World Cup exit to Germany - ESPN FC	The dust has settled a little now. The disappointment is still there, regrets they have a few, but the French players are going home. On Saturday evening, they will land at Bourget airport, near Paris, and each of the 23 squad members and staff will go their own way. Their World Cup is finished, the dream is over. It has been a good ride though, a very positive six weeks, but the way France went out has left the bitter taste in the mouth of the players and the fans. The meeting with Germany was the first big hurdle in the competition for Les Bleus and it was a high one, definitely too high, on every level, for this team. Mentally, the Germans have a psychological advantage on the French when it comes to competitive games. Physically, they were fresher, fitter and suffered less than Dider Deschamps' men. Technically, their three-man midfield taught their French counterparts -- Paul Pogba, Yohan Cabaye and Blaise Matuidi -- a tough lesson. Crucially, the lack of experience from this young French team compared to the Germans made a big difference. Before kickoff, the German starting XI had played 75 more World Cup games than the France starting XI. It was evident in the way Joachim Low's players controlled the game and never panicked. They were accustomed to playing high-pressure matches while French nerves wracked the French camp. - Delaney: France run out of steam against Germany France's youth and naivety was also exposed on the goal where Raphael Varane was too easily beaten by Mats Hummels on the sole goal of the game. The conditions (heat and humidity) were also a problem for the French to chase the game which was necessary after going behind so early. Overall, there is a sense, shared by the players I spoke to, that France lost without playing. They were disappointed. They showed no urgency in the second half and no fluidity in their game. What's interesting is that they hardly took advantage of the famous high defensive German line despite it being their Plan A without much of a Plan B. They should have tried to vary their game more rather than constantly trying to go long and in behind the Germany back four. And the few times they were in good position, they simply were not clinical enough. The Germans, once again, taught us a good lesson. Just like the semifinals of 1982 (when they lost 5-4 on penalties) and 1986 (when they lost 2-0). While Friday's game has its similarities with that of Mexico '86, after that disappointing night in Guadalajara, France went through a long and terrible period of misfortune and hardship -- not even qualifying for the 1988 European Championship, and the 1990 and 1994 World Cups. This time is different. Though Germany still look well ahead of France, the future is bright and promising for the French. The team will learn a lot from this defeat. For Varane, Pogba, Antoine Griezmann (who was inconsolable after the match), Mamadou Sakho and Matuidi, it has been a great learning curve. For this squad, it was the very first quarterfinal in a big competition and next time they play one, they will know how to deal with it. The whole experience of this World Cup, the way the squad lived together for six weeks, its relationship with Deschamps, the newly found passion and love from the French fans for their national team, the confidence and the momentum it has brought French football overall is golden for the future. This World Cup has kicked off a new dawn for French football. Didier Deshamps and his players were unable to break down Germany. Brazil has also been a great experience for Deschamps. Praised up to this quarterfinal, he totally failed in his head-to-head with Low. Just like his players, Deschamps suffered from a lack of experience compared to the German head coach. Low outplayed him before the game. Deschamps, naively, didn't seem to anticipate that his counterpart would change so many things in his team and had no contingency once Plan A didn't work. He got it wrong in his coaching during the game too. He took too long to make his substitutions, made the wrong ones when he made them, and overall he never managed to inspire a comeback from his players in the second half. He should also arguably take blame for a lack of urgency from his charges. Knowing him well, he would not have liked what happened on Friday, he will reflect on it for a long time and will make sure that he comes out of it stronger and that he never makes the same mistakes again. But, now, what's next for Deschamps and his Bleus? Few people criticised the head coach for saying that with this World Cup he was preparing for Euro 2016. There was nothing wrong in that. It was impossible for France to win this World Cup. As we saw on Friday, the players and the manager were neither ready nor good enough for it. However, 2016 is a realistic objective. All the experience picked up in Brazil will be useful, the players will be two years older and will benefit from two more seasons in their top clubs. For Deschamps, over the next two years, he will profit from the friendly games France will take part in to sharpen their playing style, he will try different things and get the team in perfect shape, on top form and in a tactical place for the start of Euro 2016. This clash with Germany came too early. In two years' time, at home, France will be ready to take on anyone. On Friday, Les Bleus measured the gap between them and the big guns of world football. Two years is enough to have a chance to join them in the elite. Julien Laurens A French football journalist based in London working for Le Parisien, RTL, BT Sport and ESPN.	sports
Van Walle: Belgium ready for new chapter vs. Argentina - ESPN FC	Belgium vs Argentina. It's a big one -- and not only because the winner is through to the last four on the World Cup. In Belgium, the game has extra history attached. 1982, 13 June, Barcelona. Facing off at Nou Camp for the opening game of the World Cup are reigning world champions Argentina and vice-European champions Belgium. A clash of styles. Belgium are not noted for their attractive football. They tend to rely on resolute defending, then hit opponents on the break. It is a team of obstinate fighters and many an opponent is left with bruised ankles and shins. Argentina plays fluent, attacking football and boasts a young world-beater called Diego Armando Maradona, who is expected to set the tournament alight. But Belgium's head coach, Guy Thys has a plan. Ludo Coeck, their most technically gifted player, is sacrificed in a cynical display of anti-football. He tracks and harasses Maradona for 90 minutes, effectively taking him out of the game. Belgium win by a solitary goal from Erwin Vandenbergh. Argentina vs. Belgium: July 5 (ESPN and WatchESPN) - Van Walle: Belgian belief continues to grow - Laurens: Spotlight on Divock Origi - Macintosh: Player stocks, who's rising? - 50-50 Challenge: Argentina vs. Belgium - Five Aside: Group winners roll into quarters - Summer Transfers: Belgians are talk of town The game is legendary in Belgium, in part thanks to Flemish commentator Rik De Saedeleer's reaction. "There he is! There he is!" he shouted as Frank Vercauteren sent a brilliant long the ball to Vandenbergh, who controlled it and beat Ubaldo Fillol with a low shot. "There he is, there he is! Goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool! Gol, gol, gol, gol, gol de Belgica!" In Belgium, it has the same status Kenneth Wolstenholme's "They think it's all over..." has in England. Belgium continued with a weak 1-0 win over El Salvador and then drew 1-1 with Hungary. The key moment of that game came when goalkeeper Jean-Marie Pfaff came out of his area and collided heavily with right back Eric Gerets, who was injured. Thys replaced Pfaff with Theo Custers for the next game against Poland and Zbigniew Boniek destroyed Belgium with a hat trick. Belgium, with yet another goalkeeper, Jacky Munaron, then lost 1-0 to the Soviet Union to put a disappointing end to a tournament that had started on an enormous high. Four years later, another World Cup, this time in Mexico. Belgium have surprised the world, not least themselves, by reaching the semifinals. The squad includes Jan Ceulemans, Enzo Scifo, Jean-Marie Pfaff, Eric Gerets, Georges Grun and many more who will go on to become household names in Belgium as this group of players is branded "Belgium's golden generation." But to inverse a popular saying, not all that is golden, glitters. Belgium never played well. Their football was still based on dogged defending and physical strength. They scraped through the first round as the best of the third-place teams after losing to Mexico, narrowly beating Iraq and drawing with Paraguay. The second round against the Soviet Union and the quarterfinal against Spain are the stuff of legend in Belgium but again, it was a matter of never say die, more than quality. And then came Argentina. After England had been hit by the "Hand of God", Belgium twice experienced the "Flag of God" in the first half as two promising counterattacks were stopped for nonsensical offside decisions. In the second half, Maradona got his revenge for 1982. He sliced through the Belgian defence twice for as many goals to see Belgium off. Belgium last squared off against Argentina in a World Cup in 1986 when they were defeated by a Diego Maradona-led Albiceleste. Contrary to England with the handled ball, Belgium never made much of the two offside decisions. They are rarely mentioned in the heroic stories of "when we were the fourth best team in the world." Every football fan in Belgium cherishes the memory and remembers the goals, only too happy to forget about the actual football. Around the world, the game is hardly remembered. Tellingly, a photograph often shown in its context doesn't even have anything to do with it. On it, Maradona is on the ball, facing six Belgian players seemingly trying to stop him. In fact, the picture was just as Maradona hit a free kick and the Belgians left the wall. More importantly, it's actually from 1982. These two games loom large over Saturday's quarterfinal. The 'golden generation' is mentioned daily as the current players to emulate the success of 1986. In fact, the whole comparison is based only on the fact that Belgium are playing Argentina. The rest is rubbish, and there is a good reason for saying so. Belgium 2014 has already emulated Belgium 1986. While the 1986 team qualified for the World Cup after two playoff games against Holland, having finished second in their group, the 2014 version stormed through qualifying, playing some impressive football to win their group a staggering nine points ahead of Croatia. Eight wins, two draws, eighteen goals for, four against. And if the football wasn't exciting in the first round games, it was solid and fair. And it was immensely effective: played three, won three, a penalty the only conceded goal. But the football showed during the second round game against the United States was mesmerising. Thirty-nine shots on goal, 27 on target. Insane statistics in this day and age. The only thing stopping the game from turning into a massacre was Tim Howard's unbelievable performance in the U.S. goal. It will take some performance to stop him from being named best goalkeeper of the tournament. Belgium are finally playing football the way it was meant to be played. And already it feels a lot better than 1986. Because the other thing is that, as opposed to 1986, this time it feels like it is just the beginning, because there is a belief starting to build in Belgium that they can actually do this. For a country always so eager to be the underdog, this is shocking. But the truth is that rather than looking at the threat of Lionel Messi and how to counter it, if Belgium look at Argentina's weakness at the back and play the same game, they will score. That defence is slow and cumbersome. And Sergio Romero is no Howard. As I said a month ago, no one is certain to stop this team. No one. Wim van Walle Wim Van Walle has contributed to ESPNFC since 2010. Back in 1980, his passion for football was decided by the teams of the day. And apparently it stuck. Three decades later, Van Walle is still as passionate about Belgium's Red Devils and Nottingham Forest.	sports

They were accustomed to playing high-pressure matches while French nerves wracked the French camp. - Delaney: France run out of steam against Germany France's youth and naivety was also exposed on the goal where Raphael Varane was too easily beaten by Mats Hummels on the sole goal of the game. The conditions (heat and humidity) were also a problem for the French to chase the game which was necessary after going behind so early. Overall, there is a sense, shared by the players I spoke to, that France lost without playing. They were disappointed. They showed no urgency in the second half and no fluidity in their game. What's interesting is that they hardly took advantage of the famous high defensive German line despite it being their Plan A without much of a Plan B. They should have tried to vary their game more rather than constantly trying to go long and in behind the Germany back four. And the few times they were in good position, they simply were not clinical enough. The Germans, once again, taught us a good lesson. Just like the semifinals of 1982 (when they lost 5-4 on penalties) and 1986 (when they lost 2-0). While Friday's game has its similarities with that of Mexico '86, after that disappointing night in Guadalajara, France went through a long and terrible period of misfortune and hardship -- not even qualifying for the 1988 European Championship, and the 1990 and 1994 World Cups. This time is different. Though Germany still look well ahead of France, the future is bright and promising for the French. The team will learn a lot from this defeat. For Varane, Pogba, Antoine Griezmann (who was inconsolable after the match), Mamadou Sakho and Matuidi, it has been a great learning curve. For this squad, it was the very first quarterfinal in a big competition and next time they play one, they will know how to deal with it. The whole experience of this World Cup, the way the squad lived together for six weeks, its relationship with Deschamps, the newly found passion and love from the French fans for their national team, the confidence and the momentum it has brought French football overall is golden for the future. This World Cup has kicked off a new dawn for French football. Didier Deshamps and his players were unable to break down Germany. Brazil has also been a great experience for Deschamps. Praised up to this quarterfinal, he totally failed in his head-to-head with Low. Just like his players, Deschamps suffered from a lack of experience compared to the German head coach. Low outplayed him before the game. Deschamps, naively, didn't seem to anticipate that his counterpart would change so many things in his team and had no contingency once Plan A didn't work. He got it wrong in his coaching during the game too. He took too long to make his substitutions, made the wrong ones when he made them, and overall he never managed to inspire a comeback from his players in the second half. He should also arguably take blame for a lack of urgency from his charges. Knowing him well, he would not have liked what happened on Friday, he will reflect on it for a long time and will make sure that he comes out of it stronger and that he never makes the same mistakes again. But, now, what's next for Deschamps and his Bleus? Few people criticised the head coach for saying that with this World Cup he was preparing for Euro 2016. There was nothing wrong in that. It was impossible for France to win this World Cup. As we saw on Friday, the players and the manager were neither ready nor good enough for it. However, 2016 is a realistic objective. All the experience picked up in Brazil will be useful, the players will be two years older and will benefit from two more seasons in their top clubs. For Deschamps, over the next two years, he will profit from the friendly games France will take part in to sharpen their playing style, he will try different things and get the team in perfect shape, on top form and in a tactical place for the start of Euro 2016. This clash with Germany came too early. In two years' time, at home, France will be ready to take on anyone. On Friday, Les Bleus measured the gap between them and the big guns of world football. Two years is enough to have a chance to join them in the elite. Julien Laurens A French football journalist based in London working for Le Parisien, RTL, BT Sport and ESPN.	sports

Neymar remains inspiration for Brazil in World Cup - ESPN FC	RIO DE JANEIRO -- On Saturday morning, this city began to wake up from its long night of good and bad dreams. The first few football games kicked off on the beach; joggers began their runs along the water; street sweepers and garbage men continued their endless, thankless task of tidying up. By nine o'clock the streets were already warm and opening, and the sky was blue. It will be a beautiful day. The dark hours had felt less certain. Rio had suffered earthquakes. First, there was the game against the Colombians, more nerve-wracking than anyone might have hoped. It's hard to overstate what football means to this country, especially football on its biggest stage. In the twilight after the start of Friday's game, Rio's streets were empty. The stores had been shuttered. Only an occasional car raced down the wide-open roads. It felt like everyone had gone into hiding from whatever wicked thing was going to come out after dark. But then Brazil scored, twice, and in the bars and on the beaches, in the perfect little streetscapes of Brazilians gathered around sidewalk TVs, in the towering apartment blocks draped with Brazilian flags, there were eruptions of life. When Brazil scored -- even when they came close to scoring -- fireworks that sounded like cannons went off, horns blared, men and women screamed out of their windows at each other. When the final whistle blew, and the Brazilians had hung on to win 2-1, it sounded like the end of the world if people were happy about it. Then the party really started, one of those nights that felt as though it would never end. The beachside lanes of the long Avenue Atlantica had been closed to cars, and they were filled with people instead. They were packed, in fact, with drunks and revelers, tourists and locals, a few brave Germans and thousands of Brazilians, real and make-believe. Almost all of them wore yellow, and almost all of those who wore yellow had the same fabled number on their backs in green: 10. Neymar. He had been carried off the pitch at the end of the game, and in the middle of the celebrations that was a half-worry. He was often tackled hard, and he often looked in agony. This time, Juan Camilo Zuniga had put his knee in Neymar's back -- had kneed all of Brazil square in the center of that No. 10. The contact looked bad, but not that bad. It was only Neymar's reaction that left lingering concern. He was carried off in an orange stretcher, covering his eyes and screaming, not for the first time. But it was the first time he had continued screaming all the way up the tunnel. And then the first dire news came, on Twitter feeds and smart phones, on restaurant patios and in beachside cantinas: Neymar's back was broken, and not from the load he's been carrying. He had cracked a vertebra and would be out for the rest of the tournament. Neymar was gone. There was confusion. There must be some mistake. The unhappy word had come out almost too quickly to be true, so soon after the game. How could anyone know what was wrong with Neymar, let alone any of us, more than a thousand miles away? But then the team's doctor, Rodrigo Lasmar, was quoted, and there were pictures of the worried crowd that had gathered outside the hospital in Fortaleza, and then the news really began to travel. You could almost see it in the air, a shadow coming around the corner, pouring through the city's gaps and cracks, like black water finding its level. "This is s---," one man in a Neymar jersey said on the street, and even in his sad, drunk state, or maybe especially in it, he spoke for all of Brazil. Neymar isn't everything to this country, but he is everywhere in it. He is far more than an athlete. He is a matinee idol; he is a billboard; he is a child star who was on the cusp of some brilliant adult revelation. Still only 22, he had been smiling through this tournament and all of its attendant pressures, leading his team in goals, shots, chances created and touches in the attacking half. He had looked almost destined to carry Brazil to glory at home, lifting the World Cup at the Maracana, just the way the script would have been written. Look how dramatically they survived the Chileans, and now the Colombians. They conquered much of the continent and would soon claim the world. The impossible was going to come true. By Saturday morning, a different truth was settling in. "Play For Him," read one newspaper's headline, a photograph of a stricken Neymar filling the page. Neymar isn't about to disappear from our sight. His presence could never be erased here. That would be like Rio without the mountains. He will continue to star in the same movie, but he will be cast in a different role. Now Brazil is in trouble. Nothing feels pre-destined anymore. The Germans are coming, and Thiago Silva will be out on suspension, and Neymar will be watching either from the bench or his hospital bed. He will remain an inspiration, just not in the way anyone here ever wanted to imagine. Right now in sunny Rio the beaches continue to fill. The store shutters are rising with an awakening clatter. The lines to Christ the Redeemer have started snaking up the cliffs and the first beers have been poured. The celebration here is far from over. The ocean could wash through this inexhaustible city and you'd still find someone setting off fireworks in the top of a palm tree. But now the party's biggest guest has been forced to withdraw, and even Rio doesn't have a heart big enough to pretend that things will be the same without him.	sports

FIFA to look into Brazil forward Neymar injury - ESPN FC	FIFA has told ESPN it will investigate the circumstances of the injury that has ruled Brazil forward Neymar out of the rest of the World Cup. The Barcelona player sustained a fractured vertebra in Friday's quarterfinal defeat of Colombia, and had to be stretchered off following a collision with Juan Camilo Zuniga. Referee Carlos Velasco Carballo has come under fire for his handling of a feisty game that witnessed 54 fouls, while some have expressed their anger at Zuniga's challenge. "We are awaiting the official match reports and we will gather, as well as analyse, all the necessary elements in order to evaluate the matter," a FIFA spokesperson said. Neymar was forced to return to Brazil's training camp in Teresopolis in an ambulance following the Colombia game. The 22-year-old flew back to Rio de Janeiro with the rest of his Brazil teammates on Friday but rode the rest of the way to the camp separately.

World Cup stadiums: a venue guide for Brazil 2014 - Telegraph	Local hero... Rivaldo grew up in the city and began his career at local club Santa Cruz before moving on to bigger and better things. At his peak, the forward spent five years in Spain at Barcelona, winning the World and European player of the year award in 1999. He played 74 times for his country. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stadium name: Arena da Amazônia - Manaus Capacity 44,000 How complete is it? Was supposed to be finished in early 2013, but is behind schedule and will not be completed until the spring. Average temperature in June 27.5C Average rainfall in June 84mm Famous for... being situated in the heart of the Amazon rain forest. It is the gateway to the Amazon basin and a popular tourist destination as a result. England manager Roy Hodgson was keen to avoid playing any World Cup 2014 games here as it is so far from team’s Rio De Janeiro base, but likely to be popular with fans possessing a sense of adventure Local hero... Francisco Lima Govinho was a defensive midfielder who spent the majority of his career in Italy, most notably for Roma, but also Bologna and Brescia. Like so many Brazilians, he was good enough to play in one of Europe’s top divisions but never got a game for the national team. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stadium name: Arena Pantanal (Cuiaba) Capacity 43,000 How complete is it? Has been plagued by delays since construction began in 2010 and is still several months away from completion Average temperature in June 24.1C Average rainfall in June 15.5mm Famous for… it is one of Brazil’s hottest cities with temperatures regularly exceeding 40C in the hottest months. Founded in 1727 following the discovery of gold in the area, Cuiaba is situated in the geographical centre of the South American continent, and is also in the middle of Brazilian cattle country, which ensures cowboy hats are a most-have fashion item. Local Hero: Liverpool’s Brazilian international Lucas Leiva was born Dourados, which is a neighbouring town in the state of Mato Grosso. Began his career at Gremio and moved to Anfield for £5m in 2007. A vital member of both club and national side. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stadium name: Arena das Dunas (Natal) Capacity 43,000 How complete is it? It was later than promised but the stadium is built, taking just over two years to finish. Average temperature in June 25C Average rainfall in June 210mm Famous for... a really big tree. The Maior cajueiro do mundo is the biggest cashew tree in the world. Entered into the Guinness Book of Records In 1994 as the tree which covers the largest area, 8,400 square metres, making it larger than most football pitches Local hero.. Marinho Chagas was an early example of a left-back who could defend well but also attack like a winger. Played for Brazil in the 1974 World Cup and won 36 caps. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stadium name: Estádio do Maracanã (Rio de Janeiro) Capacity: 78,838 How complete is it? The renovated stadium was completed last June, when England fans will recall a temporary threat to their friendly in Brazil going ahead as a safety certificate was confirmed. Fifa say everything is in working order now. It will hst the final this summer. Average temperature in June 22°C Average rainfall in June 3.2 inches Famous for...With a population of 6.3 million, Rio conjures images of idyllic beaches, carnivals and a samba beat. The Corcovado and Sugarloaf mountains are among the most visited landmarks on the planet and it will be the destination most fans dream of making their base. Local hero Ronaldo, Romario and Zizinho (described by Pele as the best player he ever saw) are among the many football Gods born in Rio, but for a certain generation Zico, the maestro of the 1982 World Cup, is the definitive Brazilian footballer. He was recently voted third behind Pele and Garrincha as the nation’s greatest. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stadium name: Arena de Itaquera (Sao Paulo) Capacity: 68,000 How complete is it? Following last month’s tragic accident when two workers lost their lives erecting the stadium roof, it is scheduled to be complete by the end of February. However, this may be an ambitious target. Average temperature in June 22°C Average rainfall in June 2.2 inches Famous for...A staggering 20 million people reside in the metropolis of São Paulo, but the startling contrast between rich and poor make the city one of the diverse in the world. It is considered Brazil’s most culturally vibrant city, its restaurants and bistros making it the cuisine capital. Local hero Cafu and Roberto Carlos are among the numerous luminaries who honed their skills on São Paulo’s streets, but it was Arthur Friedenreich, the son of German/African immigrants, who broke through racial barriers at the start of the 20th century. Friedenreich was Brazil’s first black professional footballer. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stadium name: Estadio Mineirao (Belo Horizonte) Capacity: 64,00 How complete is it? The redevelopment of existing stadium (new lower tier, roof extension and internal upgrades) was completed in December, 2012, making this venue one of the best equipped at this stage (according to Fifa). Average temperature in June 25°C Average rainfall in June 0.6 inches Famous for...The peculiar road of Rua do Amendoim, where cars placed in neutral gear go up the sloping street rather than down. It is a tourist curiosity, attributed to the powerful magnetic field in the surrounding area. Belo Horizonte (‘beautiful horizon’) also lists tasting the famous delicacy ‘liver with aubergine’ at Central Market at number one on its list of ’20 things you must do in the city’ . Local hero Tostao, a member of the 1970 World Cup winning team, scored 32 goals in 52 games for what is considered the greatest side there has been. He once scored 47 goals in one game in his schooldays. With 300 career goals to his name, injury forced his retirement at just 25. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stadium name: Arena da Baixada (Curitiba) Capacity: 41, 456 How complete is it? Fifa’s internal reports say it is 83 per cent complete, the pitch causing particular concern. Work is scheduled to be finished for February but this stadium is one of those causing particular worry. Average temperature in June 18°C Average rainfall in June 3.9 inches Famous for…Curitiba is translated from Portuguese as ‘many pine trees’ and has the distinction of being one of the shortest lived capital cities – three days in 1969 courtesy of the reign of the military junta. With its botanic gardens and stylistic architecture, it is regarded one of the prettiest and desirable cities in Brazil to live. Local hero The record goalscorer of Curitiba FC was Duillio Dias, who scored 202 times between 1954-64. Unearthing talent to match those from Rio and São Paulo has proved tricky, but Premier League watchers will be interested to know Manchester United’s ex-midfielder Klebberson started his career with city rivals Atlético Paranaense. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stadium name: Estadio Nacional de Brasilia (Brasilia) Capacity: 70,064 How complete is it? The stadium was completed in May this year, replacing the dismantled Estadio Nacional Mané Garrincha. Average temperature in June: 26C Average rainfall in June: 3 per cent Famous for: The Brazilian capital, Brasilia is the city that claims to have been built in 2,000 days and boasts such historic landmarks as the Cathedral, the National Congress and the Legion of Goodwill Temple. The city is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Local hero: AC Milan forward Kaka was born in the satellite city of Gama and remains arguably Brasilia's most famous export. Began his career at São Paulo before a fee of around £7million in 2003, later moving to Real Madrid. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stadium name: Arena Castelao (Fortaleza) Capacity: 67,037 How complete is it: Fully completed in December 2012, the Castelao is now an all-seater stadium and now has a larger roof and an underground car park. Average temperature in June: 29.6C Average rainfall in June: 16 per cent Famous for: Renowned as one of Brazil's most vibrant cities, Monday nights in Fortaleza have become immortalised by the 'El Pirata' nightclub which was branded "the craziest place on Earth" by the New York Times. Local hero: Bolton Wanderers fans may remember Mario Jardel with a shudder, or a chuckle. Cruelly nicknamed 'Lardel' due to his hefty waistline, the forward only made seven appearances under Sam Allardyce. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stadium name: Arena Fonte Nova - Salvador Capacity: 55,000 How complete is it? The stadium was officially opened in April but a month later a huge segment of the roof collapsed due to torrential overnight rain, but officials are optimistic there will be no problems. Average temperature in June: 26.5C Average rainfall in June: 23.C Famous for: Salvador is known as the capital of happiness in Brazil and hosts the Central do Carnaval, one of the country's most famous annual celebrations. The Fonte Nova appears quite incongrous in the city due to its space-age design. Local hero: Bebeto. The former Brazil international, now 49, was born in Salvador and is revered in the city, named as one of the six ambassadors for the 2014 World Cup. Started his career at tiny Salvador club Vitoria. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stadium name: Estadio Jose Pinheiro Borda (Porto Alegre) Capacity: TBC (est 50,287) How complete is it?

Local hero: Ronaldinho, the 33-year old Brazil forward, was born in Porto Alegre and won the Fifa World Player of the Year Award in 2004 and 2005. Also known as 'Gaucho' to distinguish him from Ronaldo, his former fellow international.	sports
Argentina vs Belgium, World Cup 2014: live - Telegraph	Referee: Nicola Rizzoli (Italy). 1.40pm Betfair report a big move for Argentina today, 6/5 into 19/20, against Belgium. If you fancy a flutter on the other game tonight, the Netherlands are drifting all the time and are now 8/15 against Costa Rica from a very short looking 4/9. 1pm Here's Alan Hansen's take on today's game, and in particular on Chelsea star Eden Hazard: Eden Hazard has performed in fits and starts for Belgium at this World Cup, but the team everybody tipped as dark horses in Brazil need their most talented player to rise to the occasion if they are to overcome Argentina on Saturday. Make no mistake, Belgium could beat the Argentines and qualify for the semi-finals because the lack of an outstanding team at the tournament has made it the most open World Cup I can remember. But for all the talk of Belgium being an emerging force and a potential winner in Brazil, they have not been anywhere near as good as many observers had suggested they would be. Read the rest of his piece here. 11am Argentina will once again turn to Lionel Messi for inspiration when they tackle star-studded Belgium in Brasilia on Saturday in a World Cup quarter-final haunted by ghosts of yesteryear. Victory would take Argentina into the last four - where either Holland or Costa Rica will await - for only the second time since they last won the tournament in 1986, beating Belgium in the semi-finals en route. But despite results living up to expectations - Argentina have won all four of their games to date - performances have not, and the team's dependence on Messi has been cited as the key factor. With four goals in three matches, the Barcelona megastar was his side's saviour in the group phase, while in the 1-0 extra-time victory over Switzerland in the last 16 he seemed the only player capable of making a difference. Diego Maradona was scathing of the team's performance, warning coach Alejandro Sabella that he is destined for "catastrophe" if he cannot alleviate some of the burden on the team's outstanding player. Argentina's assault on the World Cup was supposed to be spearheaded by their 'Fantastic Four' attackers, but Messi is the only one who has lived up to his billing so far. Sergio Aguero is a serious doubt for the Belgium game due to a muscle injury, Gonzalo Higuain is still waiting for his first goal, and despite scoring the winner against the Swiss, Angel Di Maria has delighted and exasperated in equal measure. Facing accusations that his side are overly reliant on their number 10, Sabella said that "Argentina have always had a dependence on Messi". It is likely to be no different against Belgium and Messi's task will be rendered doubly difficult by the fact that the opposition goalkeeper, Thibaut Courtois of Atletico Madrid, has kept him at bay for seven games in succession. The Messi-Courtois duel is one of many subplots in a game that carries strong echoes of the last World Cup encounter between the teams in Mexico City, which Argentina won 2-0 thanks to a glorious Maradona brace. Then, as now, Argentina were dependent on the brilliance of one prodigiously gifted player, whereas Belgium's success was built upon the emergence of an exceptionally talented generation of players. While the Belgian side of 1986 boasted the razor-sharp creative instincts of Enzo Scifo, the current team can call upon Eden Hazard, but the 23-year-old is yet to fully catch fire in Brazil. Although he came up with crucial and timely assists in the group-phase wins over Algeria and Russia, the Chelsea winger is yet to score. However, coach Marc Wilmots is adamant that Belgium do not have dependency issues of their own. "When the opponent lets him, he's dangerous, but it's the same thing with (Dries) Mertens and (Kevin) De Bruyne," he said. "Eden might be picked out by the international press as the star of the squad, but what I see is that Belgium are a block who don't depend on the performances of a single player." Wilmots has vowed to exploit a "lack of balance" in Argentina's team and he has been aided by the news that captain Vincent Kompany should be fit to start despite an ongoing groin problem. With Aguero unlikely to recover in time, Ezequiel Lavezzi is expected to continue in attack for Argentina at the Mane Garrincha National Stadium. Marcos Rojo's suspension, meanwhile, means that unheralded left-back Jose Maria Basanta will be tasked with shackling the dangerous Mertens on Argentina's left flank. "Rojo is very good, but we have faith in Basanta too," said Sabella. Here is John Ley's match preview, with team news, stats and other goodies.	sports

Holland vs Costa Rica, World Cup 2014: live - Telegraph	Despite the talents of Joel Campbell and Bryan Ruiz in attack, it has been more a case of grit and organisation than Latin flair with Jorge Luis Pinto's side conceding only two goals so far and scoring five. Costa Rica have already outdone their best World Cup performance, reaching the last 16 in 1990, much to the jubilation of fans back home whose celebrations have stretched long into the night. Whether the parties continue depends on the Netherlands, whose hard-nosed approach and late comebacks have already dashed the dreams of millions of fans in Chile and Mexico. The 2010 finalists began the World Cup with a heady 5-1 rout of reigning champions Spain, and then came from behind to beat Australia 3-2. Objections surfaced over their counter-attacking style after the 2-0 win against Chile, which was achieved with two late goals and with veteran forward Dirk Kuyt playing left-back. And much sympathy for the Oranje evaporated when Arjen Robben, after earning the injury-time penalty that sank Mexico 2-1, admitted diving during the last-16 tie. After a furore over those comments Robben will not expect any favours from Uzbek referee Ravshan Irmatov, who is yet to give a penalty in his eight-game World Cup career. But the Bayern Munich flyer's duel against Keylor Navas, one of the World Cup's goalkeeping heroes whose one-handed penalty stop denied Greece, will be closely watched. Navas, who is expected to recover from a shoulder injury, can also expect a work-out from Robin van Persie with emerging PSV Eindhoven star Memphis Depay likely to figure later on. In a blow to the Dutch, midfield enforcer Nigel de Jong is out with a groin injury, meaning a reshuffle for the Manchester United-bound Van Gaal. But the coach has shown cool tactical nous and opportunism, first by redeploying Kuyt and also using the World Cup's first cooling break to switch tactics against Mexico. Costa Rica have problems in defence with centre-back Oscar Duarte - who scored a brilliant header against Uruguay - suspended and the left-sided Roy Miller an injury concern. Up front, expect another starring role from Campbell, 22, whose eye-catching tournament could prompt Arsenal to recall him after loan spells at Lorient, Real Betis and Olympiakos. Playing behind Campbell will be the assured Ruiz, 28, completing an attacking duo which has yielded three of Costa Rica's goals so far. The Fulham forward said Costa Rica were capable of shocking the Dutch - a seismic upset for the World Cup, but one which would find favour with neutrals and romantics. "Saturday's game is like a final for us, but we don't want to stop there," said Ruiz. "Holland is a great team, but I have to be honest and say that we have a good chance of beating them. But we have to take care of a lot of details if we want to win." The eventual winner at Salvador's Fonte Nova Arena will play either Argentina or Belgium for a place in the July 13 final in Rio de Janeiro.	sports
James Rodriguez gives grasshopper a ride but his penalty is not enough as Brazil beat Colombia 2-1 - Telegraph	Inconsolable, the playmaker then broke down. Brazil defender David Luiz, whose superb free kick turned out to be the deciding goal, tried to comfort Rodriguez, putting his arm around him. The players exchanged shirts and Luiz applauded Rodriguez as he slowly walked toward the tunnel. Before he got there, Colombia coach Jose Pekerman gave him a hug. "I tried to calm him down because he deserves huge congratulations," Pekerman said. At 22, Rodriguez had become the most feared man among Brazil fans. His six goals are two more than Brazil forward Neymar has managed and his 80th-minute penalty ignited a late surge in Fortaleza that made the home fans tense. "He is an outstanding player, a huge talent, he has ambitions," Pekerman said. "He has tried to do his best in a hard match. This is an elimination that leaves one of the best players in the World Cup out of the tournament." One of his goals against Uruguay in the second round has been described as among the best of the tournament, when he chested down the ball and volleyed it past the goalkeeper. While Rodriguez couldn't pull off a similar moment of brilliance to equalize against Brazil, there were glimpses of his talent. In a match that saw 54 fouls between both teams and many of them committed against Rodriguez, he was still able to drive forward and at times move past defenders with ease. When Radamel Falcao was cut from Colombia's final 23-man squad because he failed to recover from a serious knee injury, many thought the South American team would exit the tournament at the group stage. But a new Colombian star has emerged and big things will be expected of him. "He will show in the future," Pekerman said, "that he can be one of the best." · The many extraordinary faces of David Luiz · In pictures: Neymar ruled out of World Cup with broken back · 'Get well soon, my friend' - Messi leads tributes to Neymar · David Luiz sends Brazil into the semi-final · Alan Smith on the battle between Neymar and Rodriguez	sports

James Rodriguez gives grasshopper a ride but his penalty is not enough as Brazil beat Colombia 2-1 - Telegraph	Inconsolable, the playmaker then broke down. Brazil defender David Luiz, whose superb free kick turned out to be the deciding goal, tried to comfort Rodriguez, putting his arm around him. The players exchanged shirts and Luiz applauded Rodriguez as he slowly walked toward the tunnel. Before he got there, Colombia coach Jose Pekerman gave him a hug. "I tried to calm him down because he deserves huge congratulations," Pekerman said. At 22, Rodriguez had become the most feared man among Brazil fans. His six goals are two more than Brazil forward Neymar has managed and his 80th-minute penalty ignited a late surge in Fortaleza that made the home fans tense. "He is an outstanding player, a huge talent, he has ambitions," Pekerman said. "He has tried to do his best in a hard match. This is an elimination that leaves one of the best players in the World Cup out of the tournament." One of his goals against Uruguay in the second round has been described as among the best of the tournament, when he chested down the ball and volleyed it past the goalkeeper. While Rodriguez couldn't pull off a similar moment of brilliance to equalize against Brazil, there were glimpses of his talent.

Holland vs Costa Rica, World Cup 2014: live - Telegraph	Despite the talents of Joel Campbell and Bryan Ruiz in attack, it has been more a case of grit and organisation than Latin flair with Jorge Luis Pinto's side conceding only two goals so far and scoring five. Costa Rica have already outdone their best World Cup performance, reaching the last 16 in 1990, much to the jubilation of fans back home whose celebrations have stretched long into the night. Whether the parties continue depends on the Netherlands, whose hard-nosed approach and late comebacks have already dashed the dreams of millions of fans in Chile and Mexico. The 2010 finalists began the World Cup with a heady 5-1 rout of reigning champions Spain, and then came from behind to beat Australia 3-2. Objections surfaced over their counter-attacking style after the 2-0 win against Chile, which was achieved with two late goals and with veteran forward Dirk Kuyt playing left-back. And much sympathy for the Oranje evaporated when Arjen Robben, after earning the injury-time penalty that sank Mexico 2-1, admitted diving during the last-16 tie. After a furore over those comments Robben will not expect any favours from Uzbek referee Ravshan Irmatov, who is yet to give a penalty in his eight-game World Cup career. But the Bayern Munich flyer's duel against Keylor Navas, one of the World Cup's goalkeeping heroes whose one-handed penalty stop denied Greece, will be closely watched. Navas, who is expected to recover from a shoulder injury, can also expect a work-out from Robin van Persie with emerging PSV Eindhoven star Memphis Depay likely to figure later on. In a blow to the Dutch, midfield enforcer Nigel de Jong is out with a groin injury, meaning a reshuffle for the Manchester United-bound Van Gaal. But the coach has shown cool tactical nous and opportunism, first by redeploying Kuyt and also using the World Cup's first cooling break to switch tactics against Mexico. Costa Rica have problems in defence with centre-back Oscar Duarte - who scored a brilliant header against Uruguay - suspended and the left-sided Roy Miller an injury concern. Up front, expect another starring role from Campbell, 22, whose eye-catching tournament could prompt Arsenal to recall him after loan spells at Lorient, Real Betis and Olympiakos. Playing behind Campbell will be the assured Ruiz, 28, completing an attacking duo which has yielded three of Costa Rica's goals so far. The Fulham forward said Costa Rica were capable of shocking the Dutch - a seismic upset for the World Cup, but one which would find favour with neutrals and romantics. "Saturday's game is like a final for us, but we don't want to stop there," said Ruiz. "Holland is a great team, but I have to be honest and say that we have a good chance of beating them. But we have to take care of a lot of details if we want to win." The eventual winner at Salvador's Fonte Nova Arena will play either Argentina or Belgium for a place in the July 13 final in Rio de Janeiro.	sports

Marc Wilmots should select Divock Origi over Romelu Lukaku in quarter-final - Telegraph	After that thriller in Salvador, when Romelu Lukaku came on to change the game for Belgium against USA, Marc Wilmots might now be wondering who to pick up front. My choice would be to stick with Divock Origi, the 19-year-old from Lille, strongly linked with Liverpool. Origi’s confidence is growing all the time. His pace and intelligent link play, particularly with Kevin de Bruyne, is capable of asking Argentina’s rearguard some awkward questions. So, for that matter, is Belgium’s threat on the left. Eden Hazard might not have set this tournament alight yet but if he can occupy Pablo Zabaleta, drag the right-back towards him, the marauding Jan Vertonghen could find space on the overlap. From a defensive standpoint, though, doubts must exist about Belgium’s ability to keep Lionel Messi quiet. As a pair, Marouane Fellaini and Axel Witsel are not the strongest blockade and Fellaini’s eagerness to get forward could leave some gaps in those pockets of space where Messi operates. That, in turn, gives the back four a problem. Vincent Kompany’s leadership will have rarely been needed more.	sports

Holland v Costa Rica: Arjen Robben will be the key man for the Dutch in their quarter-final against Los Ticos - Telegraph	Comparing these two teams from a technical perpective leaves you wondering how on earth Costa Rica can possibly win. On the plus side, they will be pleased to resume the underdog role after being expected to beat Greece in the last round. Their gameplan so far has revolved around feeding the ball to the wing-backs and getting midfield runners to attack the cross. It will be interesting to see, then, how they fare in this direction given that Holland’s likely system – 3-5-2 as well – should be able to cope. As for Costa Rica coping with Arjen Robben and Robin van Persie, that could be more tricky, especially if they try to squeeze and leave room in behind as they have done at various times. Wherever Robben plays (he was switched to the right against Mexico), the Dutchman, with his high-speed dribbling, is in the mood to take teams apart. Costa Rica have got to try to somehow keep him out of the box, usher him into areas he doesn’t want to go. For their three-man defence, heroic so far, that looks a tall order.	sports

Arjen Robben's diving worries us, say Costa Rica ahead of Holland quarter-final World Cup tie - Telegraph	“I think he is one of the three or four best players in the world, a truly great player, but on the other hand, we have to say there have been refereeing mistakes. “We're really worried about Robben's diving. And he admitted to doing it. “I would like Fifa and the referee to watch out because it is very important and can have a huge influence on the result.” Pinto, whose team can become the first Concacaf nation to reach the last four since the United States in 1930, claims Robben should be booked immediately if he dives against his team. “That may be the most logical solution,” Pinto said. “Maybe he would have to leave the field because he gets two yellow cards for diving. “Why not? That could happen. I want to trust the referees. Let's see what happens.” Louis van Gaal, meanwhile, has revealed his belief in Holland’s ability to reach the World Cup final by vowing to wear a lucky children's’ bracelet for ‘another three matches’ as Dutch coach. Van Gaal will begin work as Manchester United manager as soon as the Dutch end their participation in Brazil. But he admits that, having been given an elastic loom band by the child of a sponsor prior to the World Cup, he is determined to fulfil his promise wear the multicoloured wristband all the way to the final in the Maracana. “I didn't make the bracelet,” Van Gaal said. “The children from the head of the sponsors at ING Bank made it. “I was given it because her children made it and I promised to wear it. I will wear it again, of course. “I will always wear it when I'm coach of Holland and that is another three matches, as you know.” The Dutch face Costa Rica having fought back from a goal down to win in three of their four games so far in Brazil and Van Gaal claims the fighting qualities make up for the lack of ‘fantastic’ ability in his squad. “Our goal is to become world champions and we are a team that is difficult to beat,” Van Gaal said. “We are not a fantastic team, but we're very difficult to beat. “Even if we lose and go out, we will fight to the very last minute to become champions.”	sports

Brazil vs Colombia: David Luiz scores stunning freekick to secure hosts' spot in World Cup 2014 semi-finals - Telegraph	Yet for all their limitations, for all the pressure, for all the tears and for all the devastation at the loss of Neymar, Brazil deserve credit for reaching the semi-finals of this World Cup the hard way. For most of last night’s match, and for all the reservations we might have about the refereeing of Carlos Carballo, they were also doing it in some considerable style. Colombia had been the best team in the tournament going into the quarter-finals and, while they might complain with some justification at Brazil’s sometimes overly physical approach, they were also out-played. Indeed, the final difference between the two teams was nothing cynical or underhand – as was some of the treatment meted out on James Rodriguez as well as Neymar – but quite simply a moment of sublime Brazilian magic from David Luiz. Chelsea fans have seen something similar once or twice themselves at Stamford Bridge and Luiz’s spectacular 30 yard free-kick will not just be replayed endlessly in the days that follow but will also take its place in the catalogue of his country’s great World Cup goals. Despite a late Brazilian wobble that was compounded by Neymar being stretchered off after being kneed in the back by Juan Zuniga, it was the moment that settled the match. As Luiz sprinted towards the corner flag in celebration and pointed to the sky in thanks, his face – as well as 60,000 screaming Brazilian fans inside the Estadio Castelao and 250 million beyond – was a picture of uncontained joy. And relief. After manager Luis-Felipe Scolari had bluntly told his critics to “go to hell” before this match, it was also briefly sufficient to send his country into something approaching dreamland ahead of their semi-final against Germany in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday. The roar that accompanied the emergence of the Brazilian players for their warm-up – a full 50 minutes before kick-off – provided the first, slightly deafening release, for their expectant supporters. Beneath all the considerable pre-match bluster, Scolari had clearly been planning a tactical surprise and, faced with the counter-attacking pace of Victor Ibarbo down Colombia’s left, he dropped the attack-minded Dani Alves in favour of Maicon. Ibarbo had been missing from Colombia’s win against Uruguay but his inclusion came as little surprise, unlike Jose Pekerman’s preference in central midfield for Fredy Guarin above Abel Aguilar. It is clear that managing emotions has been the principal challenge for the Brazilian players in recent days and, when they did walk out for kick-off in front of a baying ocean of yellow and green, it was noticeable that they took to the pitch at a pace that was almost akin to slow motion. The national anthems are becoming a small contest in themselves at this World Cup and, while there were few tears this time, the volume at which the Brazilian players and fans sing seems to rise just a few decibels at every match. With his eyes closed and face contorted in emotion, there could be no mistaking just how much it all means to Silva. Far from being overwhelmed by all the fervour, however, Brazil were initially inspired. Neymar’s first sight of goal was from a free-kick that he curled narrowly wide. Showing no sign of his thigh injury, Brazil’s No10 then won a corner. Neymar’s subsequent delivery was precise, with his cross just narrowly evading the curly locks of Luiz but landing on the left knee of Silva, who cleverly adjusted his body to turn the ball into the goal. Amid all the unrestrained delirium, the crestfallen look on the face of Colombia midfielder Carlos Sanchez suggested he knew that Silva should never have been allowed to get between him and the goal. Colombia’s response was almost immediate but Silva, once again, stood tall to deflect Juan Cuardado’s shot narrowly past the post. Any suspicion that Brazil might then sit deep in an effort to conserve their lead was firmly dispelled by the scintillating 30 minute period that followed. With Fernandinho quite obviously out to play an enforcing role on Rodriguez – whether by fair means or foul – Colombia looked cowered for the first time in this tournament. Hulk has been widely disparaged for his erratic performances throughout this World Cup but was actually out-shining Neymar as Brazil’s main attacking hreat and it was only a brilliant low save from David Ospina that stopped Brazil taking a 2-0 half-time lead. Fifteen minutes respite was not enough for Colombia to significantly alter the pattern of the match. With Rodriguez continuing to be dispossessed, or just simply fouled, whenever he got near the ball, Brazil remained on the front-foot. Yet as the clock ticked past the hour-mark, signs of fatigue and nerves suddenly become evident among the Brazilian players for the first time in the match. Silva was booked and will miss the next match for needlessly blocking goalkeeper Ospina’s attempted clearance. Colombia then thought they were level. Captain Mario Yepes had put the ball into the goal following a goal-mouth scramble but had his effort controversially ruled out for offside in what was arguably an earlier phase of play. The Brazilian crowd celebrated Carballo’s decision with as much enthusiasm as a goal. They then had something far more spectacular to cheer. Rodriguez had conceded a rather needless foul 30 yards from goal, with Luiz nonchalantly stepping up and curling an impossibly powerful side-footed finish beyond Ospina. Yet there was still time for a twist. Colombia substitute Carlos Bacca broke into the penalty area and got the ball past Julio Cesar before being upended by the Brazil and Queens Park Rangers goalkeeper. As Rodriguez placed the ball on the penalty spot, there was never even the slightest doubt that he would calmly put Colombia back into the game and score his sixth goal of the tournament. Rodriguez’s World Cup, however, was ultimately to end, like Neymar’s, in uncontrolled tears. They will both surely be back to shine on this stage again. Without knowing the full severity of Neymar’s injury, the Brazil supporters again stayed behind after the match for almost 15 minutes, shouting ‘Eu acredito’ (I believe) at their heroes. Without their talisman, the players must now try to share that sentiment. · The many extraordinary faces of David Luiz · In pictures: Neymar ruled out of World Cup with broken back · Neymar ruled out of World Cup with fractured vertebrae · Alan Smith on the battle between Neymar and Rodriguez	sports
World Cup 2014: Dutch showed rarely seen ability to overcome adversity against Mexico - Telegraph	When something goes wrong for the Dutch, when their autopilot stops working and it becomes apparent they are not on a set track but on a swerving and dark road in the countryside, they tend to implode. Faced with an obstacle, even a small one, what seemed like an orange machine will stop working, and blissful harmony will be turned into petty squabbling and infighting. In Dutch football, there is little place for the individual. Rather, Holland teams tend to emphasise the collective. This becomes clear from the way managers like to set up their teams, with Louis van Gaal’s complicated way of talking about his formations perhaps being the best example, but also from the way in which supporters and analysts like to talk about Oranje. Even Dennis Bergkamp’s wonder goal against Argentina in 1998, a superb display of technical skill that helped the Dutch go through to the semi-final, cannot be solely ascribed to the former Arsenal player’s brilliance, most Dutch pundits will have you believe. It was a team effort. Without Frank de Boer’s pass, for example, Bergkamp would not have been in a position to score. When superstars, such as Johan Cruyff in the past, get too self-conscious about their ability to single-handedly change matches, their manager will often do his best to knock them down a peg or two. Think of the way managers such as Marco van Basten treated Clarence Seedorf, who was revered for his footballing skills in Italy and the rest of Europe but deemed too arrogant to play for Holland. This, of course, can lead to problems when the collective team effort is not winning the match. What is there left to do when it turns out after 80 minutes that looking for clever ways to collectively break down the opponent is of no use at all? Don’t ask Robben, Sneijder, Van Persie or anyone else who could potentially be Holland’s equivalent of Lionel Messi or – to speak in this World Cup’s terms – James Rodríguez. They are only allowed to look for cleverer ways to pass the ball. Yet against Mexico, it happened. After 88 minutes of inefficient attempts to break down the opposition’s defensive wall, Holland managed to score not once, but twice in the dying moments. What no one had expected of the Dutch had happened. This was made possible by the heroics of the collective. From Sneijder’s equaliser, that followed from a clever free-kick, to the penalty given to Arjen Robben, easily converted by Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, the proud striker seemingly content with playing a role as a supersub.

Brazil vs Colombia: David Luiz scores stunning freekick to secure hosts' spot in World Cup 2014 semi-finals - Telegraph	Yet for all their limitations, for all the pressure, for all the tears and for all the devastation at the loss of Neymar, Brazil deserve credit for reaching the semi-finals of this World Cup the hard way. For most of last night’s match, and for all the reservations we might have about the refereeing of Carlos Carballo, they were also doing it in some considerable style. Colombia had been the best team in the tournament going into the quarter-finals and, while they might complain with some justification at Brazil’s sometimes overly physical approach, they were also out-played. Indeed, the final difference between the two teams was nothing cynical or underhand – as was some of the treatment meted out on James Rodriguez as well as Neymar – but quite simply a moment of sublime Brazilian magic from David Luiz. Chelsea fans have seen something similar once or twice themselves at Stamford Bridge and Luiz’s spectacular 30 yard free-kick will not just be replayed endlessly in the days that follow but will also take its place in the catalogue of his country’s great World Cup goals. Despite a late Brazilian wobble that was compounded by Neymar being stretchered off after being kneed in the back by Juan Zuniga, it was the moment that settled the match. As Luiz sprinted towards the corner flag in celebration and pointed to the sky in thanks, his face – as well as 60,000 screaming Brazilian fans inside the Estadio Castelao and 250 million beyond – was a picture of uncontained joy. And relief. After manager Luis-Felipe Scolari had bluntly told his critics to “go to hell” before this match, it was also briefly sufficient to send his country into something approaching dreamland ahead of their semi-final against Germany in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday. The roar that accompanied the emergence of the Brazilian players for their warm-up – a full 50 minutes before kick-off – provided the first, slightly deafening release, for their expectant supporters. Beneath all the considerable pre-match bluster, Scolari had clearly been planning a tactical surprise and, faced with the counter-attacking pace of Victor Ibarbo down Colombia’s left, he dropped the attack-minded Dani Alves in favour of Maicon. Ibarbo had been missing from Colombia’s win against Uruguay but his inclusion came as little surprise, unlike Jose Pekerman’s preference in central midfield for Fredy Guarin above Abel Aguilar. It is clear that managing emotions has been the principal challenge for the Brazilian players in recent days and, when they did walk out for kick-off in front of a baying ocean of yellow and green, it was noticeable that they took to the pitch at a pace that was almost akin to slow motion. The national anthems are becoming a small contest in themselves at this World Cup and, while there were few tears this time, the volume at which the Brazilian players and fans sing seems to rise just a few decibels at every match. With his eyes closed and face contorted in emotion, there could be no mistaking just how much it all means to Silva. Far from being overwhelmed by all the fervour, however, Brazil were initially inspired. Neymar’s first sight of goal was from a free-kick that he curled narrowly wide. Showing no sign of his thigh injury, Brazil’s No10 then won a corner. Neymar’s subsequent delivery was precise, with his cross just narrowly evading the curly locks of Luiz but landing on the left knee of Silva, who cleverly adjusted his body to turn the ball into the goal. Amid all the unrestrained delirium, the crestfallen look on the face of Colombia midfielder Carlos Sanchez suggested he knew that Silva should never have been allowed to get between him and the goal. Colombia’s response was almost immediate but Silva, once again, stood tall to deflect Juan Cuardado’s shot narrowly past the post. Any suspicion that Brazil might then sit deep in an effort to conserve their lead was firmly dispelled by the scintillating 30 minute period that followed.

Neymar ruled out of World Cup with fractured vertebrae after injury in Brazil's win over Colombia - Telegraph	"It's a big loss for us," midfielder Fernandinho said. "We need to find a way to stay together and become stronger after losing our greatest player. We will try to win this World Cup and for sure we will dedicate it to Neymar." Full-back Maicon said: “We must give Neymar all our support but it is complicated now, at this stage of a World Cup.” Thiago Silva paid tribute to his team-mate. "They take your dream of playing the World Cup semi final and final. I love you my brother Neymar. We'll fight for you." Zuniga did not receive even a ­caution for the high challenge on Neymar, while Brazil captain Thiago Silva is now also suspended for the Germany match after a soft booking for impeding Colombia goalkeeper David Ospina. “Not even a yellow card, nothing,” said Brazil manager Scolari. “Then Silva gets a yellow card for walking past the goalkeeper. It’s hard to understand. “Everyone knows Neymar would be hunted. Three matches that has been happening but no one thinks that’s the case, they only think Germany is hunted, not Neymar. We are in a slightly difficult position for the match against Germany but we have great players. If anything has to change we will do that and I think we will still have a great game.” Striker Hulk added: "Every time is like this. Players always come after Neymar. The referees need to do more to keep this from happening." Zuniga defended himself against charges the tackle was reckless. “It was a normal move,” he said. “I never meant to hurt a player. I was on the field, playing for the shirt from my country, not with the intent to injure. I was just defending my shirt.” Neymar was visibly crying out in pain as he left the pitch last night and was immediately assessed by the ­Brazilian team doctor before being taken for further examination at a local hospital. “He’s at a clinic, undergoing tests,” said Scolari. “He has already been sent to a private clinic. He was kneed on his lower back, he was crying out in pain. ” There were a total of 54 fouls in last night’s match — the most at this World Cup — and Scolari admitted that his players were not totally innocent. Fernandinho delivered some especially heavy tackles on Colombia playmaker James Rodríguez. “There were also moments when our players were tougher than they should be, we know that,” said Scolari. “We could have stopped ours and their violent game.” · The many extraordinary faces of David Luiz · In pictures: Neymar ruled out of World Cup with broken back · 'Get well soon, my friend' - Messi leads tributes to Neymar · David Luiz sends Brazil into the semi-final · Alan Smith on the battle between Neymar and Rodriguez	sports

Neymar ruled out of World Cup with fractured vertebrae after injury in Brazil's win over Colombia - Telegraph	"It's a big loss for us," midfielder Fernandinho said. "We need to find a way to stay together and become stronger after losing our greatest player. We will try to win this World Cup and for sure we will dedicate it to Neymar." Full-back Maicon said: “We must give Neymar all our support but it is complicated now, at this stage of a World Cup.” Thiago Silva paid tribute to his team-mate. "They take your dream of playing the World Cup semi final and final. I love you my brother Neymar. We'll fight for you." Zuniga did not receive even a ­caution for the high challenge on Neymar, while Brazil captain Thiago Silva is now also suspended for the Germany match after a soft booking for impeding Colombia goalkeeper David Ospina. “Not even a yellow card, nothing,” said Brazil manager Scolari. “Then Silva gets a yellow card for walking past the goalkeeper. It’s hard to understand. “Everyone knows Neymar would be hunted. Three matches that has been happening but no one thinks that’s the case, they only think Germany is hunted, not Neymar. We are in a slightly difficult position for the match against Germany but we have great players. If anything has to change we will do that and I think we will still have a great game.” Striker Hulk added: "Every time is like this. Players always come after Neymar. The referees need to do more to keep this from happening." Zuniga defended himself against charges the tackle was reckless. “It was a normal move,” he said. “I never meant to hurt a player. I was on the field, playing for the shirt from my country, not with the intent to injure. I was just defending my shirt.” Neymar was visibly crying out in pain as he left the pitch last night and was immediately assessed by the ­Brazilian team doctor before being taken for further examination at a local hospital. “He’s at a clinic, undergoing tests,” said Scolari. “He has already been sent to a private clinic. He was kneed on his lower back, he was crying out in pain. ” There were a total of 54 fouls in last night’s match — the most at this World Cup — and Scolari admitted that his players were not totally innocent. Fernandinho delivered some especially heavy tackles on Colombia playmaker James Rodríguez. “There were also moments when our players were tougher than they should be, we know that,” said Scolari. “We could have stopped ours and their violent game.” · The many extraordinary faces of David Luiz · In pictures: Neymar ruled out of World Cup with broken back · 'Get well soon, my friend' - Messi leads tributes to Neymar · David Luiz sends Brazil into the semi-final · Alan Smith on the battle between Neymar and Rodriguez	sports
Holland v Costa Rica: Louis van Gaal hopes superstition can guide the Dutch to World Cup glory - Telegraph	“I was given it because her children made it and I promised to wear it. I will wear it again, of course. “I will always wear it when I'm coach of Holland and that is another three matches, as you know.” Aside from superstition, Van Gaal admits he is relying on the influence of the senior figures in the Dutch squad to navigate a path to the semi-finals at the expense of Costa Rica. “We have four or five older players and the influence of these is quite substantial,” Van Gaal said. “We have a young group and Robin (van Persie) is the captain, the man responsible for the younger ones. “He does that with (Arjen) Robben, (Dirk) Kuyt and (Wesley) Sneijder. That's good and pleasant for a coach to have players who will do everything it takes and look after the young players, in the spirit of the coach. I'm pleased with that. “Like the Costa Rica players, the rest don’t have experience of this level of football, but our senior guys mean we have a slight advantage.” The Dutch go into the game at Arena Fonte Nova having fought back from a goal down to win in three of their four games so far in Brazil. And Van Gaal claims the fighting qualities make up for the lack of ‘fantastic’ ability in his squad. “Our goal is to become world champions and we are a team that is difficult to beat,” Van Gaal said. “We are not a fantastic team, but we're very difficult to beat. “We have shown that so far and hope we can keep it up until the final. “We haven't played so well in possession, but when the opposition have the ball we are one of the best teams, if not the best, with individual qualities and skills. “But the best 23 players will win this World Cup. That will remain. Even if we lose and go out, we will fight to the very last minute to become champions.” - Feyenoord talent factory rolls out stars for Holland - Holland v Costa Rica: match preview	sports
Brazil vs Colombia, World Cup 2014: live - Telegraph	90+ mins: Brazil clinging on. Two minutes added time left, roughly. Brazil panicky, Colombia frantic. Hernanes fouls Zuniga. 90+ mins: Corner Colombia. James takes it. Ramos flick on but nobody is following in at the far post. 90 mins: James Rodriguez and company trying to fiddle a way through, James thinks he has been fouled, and that Bacca had too, neither given. Brazil backs to the wall. 89 mins: What can Colombia throw at Brazil in the five minutes of added time? 87 mins: Bacca with a good run, shot charged down. James Rodriguez testing the ref's patience/comptence by shouldering Marcelo into touch. 86 mins: Zuniga's clattered Neymar in the back, the Brazil star is hurt. Stretcher. He's taken off down the tunnel. Crying. Henrique on in his place. It's on his arm. Oh my goodness. No thanks 85 mins: Zuniga with a gallop, Oscar matches him stride for stride, and is felt to have had the last touch as it goes behind for a Colom corner. Paulinho is coming off, Hernanes is on. 83 mins: Respite for Brazil when Zapata gives away a cheap foul on Fernandinho. 81 mins: Another corner for Colombia. Hulk off, Ramires on. Cleared. Another corner. Ramires clears. Rafael Nadal writes: Footballers, being human, do what they can to get ahead. If they aren't given a yellow for fouling, they're going to do it more, not less, as the stats show. If they could get away with fighting like one can in Ice Hockey there'd be tear-ups every five minutes. FIFA needs to stop telling refs to indulge players in this manner. It's a Barton/Catermole Charter. 80 mins: Colombia take a short corner, flcked header from Bacca shaves the post... ah, offside. Good grief look at the size of that insect 79 mins: Quintero on, Cuadrado off. Come on Colombia! They're up for this now. They've won a corner kick and Brazil are in for a nervy ten minutes. GOAL! James Rodriguez stutters in the run up, hesitates, sends him the wrong way and Colombia are back in it. Brazil 2 Colombia 1 (James 78p) 77 mins: PENALTY Colombia. James slips it through, sub Bacca is onto it and Julio Cesar has brought him down with a wild challenge. It's a penalty. I think Luiz had covered back enough to make it possible for the ref to give the keeper only a yellow, also Bacca had lost control of the ball. James to take it. 75 mins: Neymar with a quadruple tumble roll on sight of the penalty area. Massively going off this Brazil side, personally. 73 mins: This is going to leave a slightly uneasy taste, I fancy. A bit like Brazil's opening match of the tournament. They've certainly had the breaks. And they've been dirty. Perhaps Neymar can make it all better with this attractive curling shot? No, wide. 72 mins: One of the things they have got is Bacca on for Gutierrez. Looks like Yepez has been booked for dissent. 70 mins: What have Colombia got, then? GOAL! A brilliant, brilliant freekick from Luiz. No stopping that. Colombia's players are furious, they think that it was a harsh freekick I guess, or just generally that they have been hard done-by. I'd agree with the latter. But you cannot argue about the class of the freekick. Brazil 2 Colombia 0 (Luiz 69) 67 mins: David Luiz will take the freekick. 66 mins: Brazil have kicked James all over the park but it's he who will go in the book after making a sliding tackle that hardly makes contact with Marcelo. 65 mins: Colombia have the ball in the net after a goalmouth scramble, but the flag is up for offside. Had been up for a while in fact. 63 mins: LARF! Finally the ref has his cards out and it's for a silly bump on the goalie as he takes a kick, and it's the Brazil skipper Thiago Silva, who will now miss the next match. 61 mins: Cuadrado loses the rag and blocks/shoves Neymar. no card for him either. 58 mins: Cuadrado clipped by Marcelo, ref needs to get a card out here, this game's now rubbish because Brazil are just being allowed to foul at will. 56 mins: Bit of football from Colombia, James flicks it on and Guiterrez shanks a shot over. 55 mins: Thiago Silva goes through the back of the sub Ramos. That's just a blatant yellow. Not given. Meh. This is dirty, cheap stuff from Brazil. Now Thiago Silva is making out that he's hurt. 53 mins: Marcelo and Hulk the latest Brazilians to foul an opponent. Dunno if this is a deliberate strategy or just over-excitement. Ramos has fouled Luiz, arguably. 51 mins: As it happens, Fernandinho is himself pushed to the ground and Brazil gets a freekick. It's dinked into the box and is quite obviously headed behind by a Zapata for a corner. The ref gives a goalkick. This game could well be settled by some refereeing lunacy. 49 mins: Dunno if the ref maybe thought "this game could get away from me" or what, but he's been blowing on that whistle like Bez at the Hacienda. Brazil putting in some naughty challenges, Luiz dangling a leg and tripping an opponent, while Fernandinho has shoved two people already. 46 mins: We're off for the second half of this somewhat deranged encounter. Ibarbo off and Ramos on for Colombia. HALF TIME: BRAZIL 1 COLOMBIA 0 Phew. Hectic stuff. Bonkers game, in fact. Hardly seems like the same sport that France and Germany were playing a few hours ago. Brazil bundled in a corner early on, there have been loads of mistakes from both sides, plenty of excitement, but not that much quality. Colombia headless chickens. Sense that the referee is clinging on by his fingernails. HT in Fortaleza & Brazil are 1-5 to see off Colombia who are 20-1, 11-2 the draw. If you fancy Brazil for the outright you can back them in-play at 2-1 on Betfair, while Germany are new second favs at 5-2, 4-1 Argentina 45 mins: A break for Colombia, but nothing quite working for them up front. They lose the ball and as the half concludes it is Brazil in the ascendency. That's the half.Neelesh Naik writes: David Luiz scampers forward almost in to the Colombia box. This is more like it. Brazil playing how Brazil should play. If you are Brazil you do not score from corners. Brazil goals have to come the proper way. Must have a dribble, a feint, an outrageous trick and must leave a big smile on our face. Corners huh! Corners are for Germans. 43 mins: Neymar takes it himself, goalie beaten at the far post but it doesn't quite dip enough. 41 mins: Neymar miscontrols and loses it but Zuniga does him a favour by fouling him on the edge of the box. 40 mins: Frantic, barmy stuff so far. Colombia in the game in fits and starts but you'd fancy Brazil to score a second more than a Colombian equaliser. 38 mins: Neymar and Hulk work an opening, the latter smashes it from the inside-left channel. It's "cow's backside with a banjo" time once again from this mystifying player. 36 mins: Freekick gets the big build up but is drilled into the wall. It was tapped to J-Rod, Luiz charged it down. He was nearer than ten yards, no question. 34 mins: Fernandinho is penalsied for a foot up as he challenges with Ibarbo and Cuadrado for the ball. Harshly, I feel - everyone was as guilty as anyone else. Handy freekick position on the edge of the Brazil box. 32 mins: Cuadrado and Rodriguez the only ones doing anything for Colombia. The former with a decent shot, and then the pair combine to force their way into the Brazil box before losing their way with a failed one-two. 31 mins: Hulk and Neymar battering the Colombian backline, wave after wave of attack. No respite. 29 mins: Hilarious run from David Luiz, the ball pinging off him, Colombians grabbing him, him shoving opponents, it was like rugby league or something. 26 mins: Hulk holds it up well, flicks it inside to Marcello, who shoots over. 23 mins: Now it's Brazil's turn to break - Oscar flaps when he should have made Colombia pay for some dozy play. Rodriguez tried to take a quick free kick but Colombia lost it. And yet again! Another Brazil break, these time it's Paulinho who gets into the box and is only just tackled. Superbly open game, loads of mistakes from both sides. More equal now, but whether that's becuase Colombia have raised their game or Brazil have come down to their level I cannot say. 21 mins: But suddenly Colombia can break. Rodriguez carries it forward, they've got four on three, and Cuadrado, who has been poor so far, chooses the wrong option. Should have played in one of the two team-mates surging into the box, or gone himself. Wasted, golden chance. 20 mins: Colombia under the pump and you sense a second goal is coming. 19 mins: Excellent from Brazil, Neymar breaks and Hulk storms forward into the box. Doesn't hit it that well, and the keeper beats it out. Butch Oscar with the follow-up! Saved. Two decents stops in as many seconds. 17 mins: Out of nothing, Colombia fashion a chance for... er, Brazil. Cuadrado tries to dribble out of defence, makes a total hash of it, Hulk gets to the corner of the six yard box, beats Guarin and crosses. Circus time in the Colombia defence, and Armero only just scrambles clear as Luiz looks to pounce. 14 mins: Fernandinho blocks Rodriguez, who makes a massive meal of it. 12 mins: Neymar busy as a bee, harrying the Colombian backs. 10 mins: A bustling, powerful attack from Colombia, Cuadrado involved. Wins a shooting opportunity through brute force and lets fly, not far away. Corner. Cleared. Juan Carlos Gonzalez-Najera writes: Why oh why do the Brazilians insist on playing Fred? He has been invisible all of this tournament and has not collaborated at all. At least he shaved his mustache. 8 mins: Colombia have a freekick from long range. Nope. Nowhere near. GOAL! Corner from the left, everyone has missed it, and Thiago Silva at the back stick comes with a free run. Sanchez has lost his man! It's a soft goal, he's bundled it in off his shin, but at this stage, who cares? Brazil 1 Colombia 0 (Thiago Silva 6) 5 mins: Fernandinho hits one down the channel for Neymar, who has a duel with Zapata. The Colombia back out muscles him. Corner. 3 mins: Lovely pass from Rodriguez finds Gutierrez, but Brazil clean up. Fred and Neymar run into each other. Ah, Samba Football. But luckily for Brazil, Sanchez bundles Fred over. Neymar doesn't do much with the direct free kick. 2 mins: Both sides make two changes. Paulinho for the suspended Luiz Gustavo, Maicon for Dani Alves. Colombia: Fredy Guarin and Victor Ibarbo in for Abel Aguilar and Jackson Martinez. Looks like Carlos Sanchez is going to man-mark Neymar. 1 mins: Colombia kick off and set about it right away, down the left, sling the ball in. 20.59 Genuinely not sure who I want to win. Colombia have been so cool, and my instinct is always to back the underdog... but come on. A World Cup in Brazil? How can you not want them to do well? It's a tricky one alright. Neelesh Naik The Headline in your blog is from the Times of India. Really looking forward to this game. Hope Colombia put a spanner in the works of this mediocre Brazil team Why are Brazil playing in white shorts??? Not cool... first they drop Dani Alves, then insist on picking Fred!!! and now ditching the traditional blue shorts for white! WHY? 20.57 Another inspiring, wonderful, joyful performance of the Brazil anthem. I didn't see any players crying on this occasion. Which should please Big Phil. Manuel Lagos makes a good point: As much as I want Colombia to win I predict a Brazil to win 3 - 0. It just seems Colombia has not faced real opposition in this World Cup yet and Brazil has already battled adversity. 20.56 David Luiz has got a melon stuck on his head. Shame. 20.54 So a fine peformance from the Colombians but they'll have to take second place in the singing stakes to Brazil. 20.53 Sterling effort from the Colombians, skipper especially giving it the full gun. 20.52 And now it's national anthem time. 20.51 The two captains speak out against discrimination. 20.49 And here are the visitors. 20.48 Here's the hosts. 20.46 Reader Francis Mwangi reckons Brazil 1 Colombia 0. 20.45 Here, you'll be wanting a gander at Alan Smith's rundown of the key battles and men to watch. 20.40 Our first email of the blog comes from Ana Gmaez: I am terribly excited, proud and nervous of this Colombia team who have brought this beautiful country to the forefront of the world stage for what we are - warriors, hopefuls in the face of adversity. Lovely stuff. Best of luck to your boys, Ana. 20.35 This is surely the best headline work of the World Cup so far. Not too certain of the paper but, to that sub editor: take a bow, son. 20.30 Predictions time. The great and the good of the Telegraph Sports desk: this is your chance to shine. John MacLeary 2-1 to Brazil in 90 mins. Jim Bruce-Ball reckons 2-1 Brazil in extra time, the greedy devil. Evan Fanning also fancies 2-1 to Brazil in extras, with David Luiz to be the hero. Nick Randall is bucking the trend with a little 2-0 to Colombia action. Me? I reckon penalties, with Brazil to prevail. You? 20.25 Would love to hear the explanation for Maicon replacing Dani Alves. Maicon was the Inter full-back so severely mullered by Tottenham's Gareth Bale in what amounted to the Welshman's coming out party onto the world stage. 20.16 Colombia wear red. The last time they did that in the World Cup was in 1990, when Freddy Rincon scored that blinder against West Germany. Rincon. Maicon. This is making me happy. Let's celebrate with this house banger from Roxanne Shante. 20.14 Bit of newswire copy on that. Brazil's Maicon will make his first appearance of the World Cup, replacing Dani Alves at right back in the side to face Colombia in their World Cup quarter-final on Friday. Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari made one other change to the side that beat Chile on penalties in the last 16, bringing Paulinho into the midfield to replace the suspended Luiz Gustavo. Colombia also made two changes to the team that began their 2-0 defeat of Uruguay in the second round. Midfielders Victor Ibarbo and Fredy Guarin start in place of holding midfielder Abel Aguilar and the more attack-minded Jackson Martinez, who both drop to the bench. 20.12 Woah! Big Phil's obviously madder than I thought. He's gone Maicon. Brazil: Julio Cesar; Maicon, Thiago Silva (capt), David Luiz, Marcelo; Fernandinho, Paulinho; Oscar, Neymar, Hulk; Fred Coach: Luiz Felipe Scolari (BRA) Colombia: David Ospina; Juan Camilo Zuniga, Cristian Zapata, Mario Yepes (capt), Pablo Armero; Fredy Guarin, Carlos Sanchez; Juan Guillermo Cuadrado, James Rodriguez, Victor Ibarbo; Teofilo Gutierrez Coach: Jose Pekerman (ARG) Referee: Carlos Velasco Carballo (ESP) 20.05 On the subject of feeling the pressure, here's Big Phil kicking off, and that's never not an enjoyable prospect. Jeremy Wilson with the story: Luiz Felipe Scolari, the Brazil manager, told his detractors on Thursday night that they could “go to hell” and defiantly claimed that his team would go into Friday night’s World Cup quarter-final against Colombia with “one hand on the trophy”. He's also apparently banned some hacks from the press conference. Scolari said: “There’s no way I can go down to talk to everyone. Those who were not invited it was because maybe I don’t like you that much or, at that time, I didn’t want to talk to you. That’s what I did in 2002 and I will continue to do it. Men can’t be jealous. No. Please. If you like it, you like it. If you don’t, you don’t. Just go to hell.” The impuning of whoever's masculinity, always funny. Classic Phil. 20.00 Sorry I'm just parroting out Michael's column now. But this bit is good, too: Rather like the broader Brazil team, I wasn’t sure if Neymar justified the hype. I’d seen him a few times for Barcelona and Brazil and thought he was an exceptional player, but not worthy of comparison with Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo. Although he has played well in this competition and I’ve been much more impressed with him than I was previously, he is still a level below his Argentinian rival. Should he inspire his country to World Cup success, perhaps he’ll belong on that same pedestal but he has some way to go to reach those heights. Brazil once had an entire team of ‘x-factor’ players, but in this competition the focus has been solely on Neymar – incredible pressure for a 22-year-old. 19.55 As Michael says, Brazil the team have to turn the BRAZIL the myth to their advantage: There are certain teams that possess such a status you can often feel you’re a goal down before you kick off. This is an asset Brazil can use to maximum effect in the latter stages. It just feels different playing against them, as though you expect it to be the toughest, most important game you will ever play. It is this rather than a star-studded line-up containing the world’s best players that is the primary reason they are the team everyone wanted to avoid this summer. Reputation goes a long way. When you face Brazil, you do not just feel you are playing the modern players but the essence of football itself. That can be inspiring to some and inhibiting to others, even more so when you are meeting Brazil on their own turf. 19.50 The hosts though. Blimey. Talk about the weight of expectation. It's not even that they have to beat the teams lined up against them on the other side of that halfway line, they have to equal the heroes from another era. Michael Owen expresses it well: Before the World Cup, I had doubts Brazil possessed the quality to win the tournament. Despite their progress to the quarter-final, I still need convincing. Remove the iconic yellow jerseys, take away the home advantage and assemble the same squad under a different national flag and there is nothing traditionally ‘Brazilian’ about the hosts. They are not the most flamboyant or exciting team in the competition and have not yet reached the standard of their most illustrious predecessors. 19.45 Evening all, Tyers here, indecently excited by the prospect of the tournament's most exciting team (sorry, Russia) and the hosts duking it out. It'd be tempting to say that all the pressure is on Brazil, but you never know how an unfancied, hyped side will really cope at a tournament when it comes down to the nitty-gritty, so I don't think Colombia will necessarily be immune from stress. 19.30 Henry Winter says the World Cup hosts are wary of the threat posed by Colombia's James Rodriguez, while riot police are ready in the event of Brazil being knocked out of the tournament. Estadio Castelao, Fortaleza Kick-off: 21.00 BST. TV: ITV. Team news Brazil (Possible, 4-2-3-1): Cesar; Alves, Silva, Luiz, Marcelo; Fernandinho, Gustavo; Hulk, Oscar, Neymar; Fred. Colombia (Possible, 4-4-2): Ospina; Zúñiga, Zapata, Yepes, Armero; Cuadrado, Aguilar, Sanchez, Rodríguez; Gutiérrez, Martínez. Referee: Carlos Velasco Carballo (Spain). Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari believes the lack of bad blood between his side and Colombia will allow for an attractive spectacle when the two sides clash in their World Cup quarter-final on Friday. Scolari's men needed penalties after a bruising 120 minutes to overcome Chile in the last 16 which left many of the Brazil squad in tears at the end of the match. However, the 65-year-old is hoping a less frenetic encounter will allow his players to show their talent in Fortaleza. "Colombia is a more technical team than Chile," said Scolari. "Chile have more strength and play with a spirit which makes the game dynamics very different. The rivalry with Colombia is not the same as with Chile, Argentina or Uruguay. "It was much more difficult against Chile. Colombia are also a great team with some great players, but when we don't have these rivalries our players feel more at ease." Brazil captain Thiago Silva echoed his coach's words and welcomed the challenge of stopping Colombia's free-scoring attack that has netted 11 times in four games. "For me what is good is a team that comes to play against us and technically Colombia is different in that sense. They have the skills of wanting to play which helps our team," said the Paris Saint-Germain defender on Thursday. "It is better to play these games equally than a team that plays very closed at the back. To play in 15 metres is difficult, but when you have 70 or 80 metres there is more room and freedom for our players to play." Worried that carrying the expectations of 200 million Brazilians is becoming too much for his squad, Scolari called the team's sports psychologist Regina Brandao in for an extra session with the players on Tuesday. And Brazil's star man Neymar said the sessions were having the desired effect. "I had never done anything like it before and I am quite enjoying it," added the 22-year-old. "It is not only us, in football, who are surrounded by emotion every day and need psychologists. I think it could do every person good, to make one more relaxed." Neymar also insisted he will be fully-fit to face the Colombians despite suffering thigh and knee injuries against Chile. One of the major concerns for Scolari, though, has been the lack of support for Neymar in attacking areas as he has scored half of his side's eight goals after four games, whilst other forwards Fred, Jo and Hulk have struggled to make an impact. Scolari is expected to stick by Fred and Hulk, but will be forced into at least one change from the side that faced Chile as Luis Gustavo is suspended. Tottenham Hotspur's Paulinho is the most obvious candidate to replace Gustavo with Manchester City's Fernandinho dropping into a deeper role in midfield. However, Scolari admitted he could also switch formation to a 3-5-2 with Napoli's Henrique joining David Luiz and Silva in central defence. Gustavo's absence is even more critical for the hosts given the sensational form of the tournament's top goalscorer, Colombia's James Rodriguez. The Monaco playmaker has taken on the mantle of his side's focal point with ease in the absence of the injured Radamel Falcao with five goals in four games. A fourth consecutive win for Jose Pekerman's men took them into the last eight for the first time and ahead of the biggest game in Colombian football's history, the Argentine coach insisted the need to keep their feet on the ground. "For Colombia every game is a new challenge and a step up," said the Argentine on Thursday. "Both Brazil and us cannot think about what has gone before. "We need to play our own game as we have done up to now and try to impose our play on them. The key is not to believe there is a favourite." History, though, is against the Colombians as they have only beaten Brazil twice in 25 previous meetings and only once in a competitive fixture at the 1991 Copa America.

Holland v Costa Rica: Louis van Gaal hopes superstition can guide the Dutch to World Cup glory - Telegraph	“I was given it because her children made it and I promised to wear it. I will wear it again, of course. “I will always wear it when I'm coach of Holland and that is another three matches, as you know.” Aside from superstition, Van Gaal admits he is relying on the influence of the senior figures in the Dutch squad to navigate a path to the semi-finals at the expense of Costa Rica. “We have four or five older players and the influence of these is quite substantial,” Van Gaal said. “We have a young group and Robin (van Persie) is the captain, the man responsible for the younger ones. “He does that with (Arjen) Robben, (Dirk) Kuyt and (Wesley) Sneijder. That's good and pleasant for a coach to have players who will do everything it takes and look after the young players, in the spirit of the coach. I'm pleased with that. “Like the Costa Rica players, the rest don’t have experience of this level of football, but our senior guys mean we have a slight advantage.” The Dutch go into the game at Arena Fonte Nova having fought back from a goal down to win in three of their four games so far in Brazil. And Van Gaal claims the fighting qualities make up for the lack of ‘fantastic’ ability in his squad. “Our goal is to become world champions and we are a team that is difficult to beat,” Van Gaal said. “We are not a fantastic team, but we're very difficult to beat. “We have shown that so far and hope we can keep it up until the final. “We haven't played so well in possession, but when the opposition have the ball we are one of the best teams, if not the best, with individual qualities and skills. “But the best 23 players will win this World Cup. That will remain. Even if we lose and go out, we will fight to the very last minute to become champions.” - Feyenoord talent factory rolls out stars for Holland - Holland v Costa Rica: match preview	sports
Brazil vs Colombia, World Cup 2014: live - Telegraph	90+ mins: Brazil clinging on. Two minutes added time left, roughly. Brazil panicky, Colombia frantic. Hernanes fouls Zuniga. 90+ mins: Corner Colombia. James takes it. Ramos flick on but nobody is following in at the far post. 90 mins: James Rodriguez and company trying to fiddle a way through, James thinks he has been fouled, and that Bacca had too, neither given. Brazil backs to the wall. 89 mins: What can Colombia throw at Brazil in the five minutes of added time? 87 mins: Bacca with a good run, shot charged down. James Rodriguez testing the ref's patience/comptence by shouldering Marcelo into touch. 86 mins: Zuniga's clattered Neymar in the back, the Brazil star is hurt. Stretcher. He's taken off down the tunnel. Crying. Henrique on in his place. It's on his arm. Oh my goodness. No thanks 85 mins: Zuniga with a gallop, Oscar matches him stride for stride, and is felt to have had the last touch as it goes behind for a Colom corner. Paulinho is coming off, Hernanes is on. 83 mins: Respite for Brazil when Zapata gives away a cheap foul on Fernandinho. 81 mins: Another corner for Colombia. Hulk off, Ramires on. Cleared. Another corner. Ramires clears. Rafael Nadal writes: Footballers, being human, do what they can to get ahead. If they aren't given a yellow for fouling, they're going to do it more, not less, as the stats show. If they could get away with fighting like one can in Ice Hockey there'd be tear-ups every five minutes. FIFA needs to stop telling refs to indulge players in this manner. It's a Barton/Catermole Charter. 80 mins: Colombia take a short corner, flcked header from Bacca shaves the post... ah, offside. Good grief look at the size of that insect 79 mins: Quintero on, Cuadrado off. Come on Colombia! They're up for this now. They've won a corner kick and Brazil are in for a nervy ten minutes. GOAL! James Rodriguez stutters in the run up, hesitates, sends him the wrong way and Colombia are back in it. Brazil 2 Colombia 1 (James 78p) 77 mins: PENALTY Colombia. James slips it through, sub Bacca is onto it and Julio Cesar has brought him down with a wild challenge. It's a penalty. I think Luiz had covered back enough to make it possible for the ref to give the keeper only a yellow, also Bacca had lost control of the ball. James to take it. 75 mins: Neymar with a quadruple tumble roll on sight of the penalty area. Massively going off this Brazil side, personally. 73 mins: This is going to leave a slightly uneasy taste, I fancy. A bit like Brazil's opening match of the tournament. They've certainly had the breaks. And they've been dirty. Perhaps Neymar can make it all better with this attractive curling shot? No, wide. 72 mins: One of the things they have got is Bacca on for Gutierrez. Looks like Yepez has been booked for dissent. 70 mins: What have Colombia got, then? GOAL! A brilliant, brilliant freekick from Luiz. No stopping that. Colombia's players are furious, they think that it was a harsh freekick I guess, or just generally that they have been hard done-by. I'd agree with the latter. But you cannot argue about the class of the freekick. Brazil 2 Colombia 0 (Luiz 69) 67 mins: David Luiz will take the freekick. 66 mins: Brazil have kicked James all over the park but it's he who will go in the book after making a sliding tackle that hardly makes contact with Marcelo. 65 mins: Colombia have the ball in the net after a goalmouth scramble, but the flag is up for offside. Had been up for a while in fact. 63 mins: LARF! Finally the ref has his cards out and it's for a silly bump on the goalie as he takes a kick, and it's the Brazil skipper Thiago Silva, who will now miss the next match. 61 mins: Cuadrado loses the rag and blocks/shoves Neymar. no card for him either. 58 mins: Cuadrado clipped by Marcelo, ref needs to get a card out here, this game's now rubbish because Brazil are just being allowed to foul at will. 56 mins: Bit of football from Colombia, James flicks it on and Guiterrez shanks a shot over. 55 mins: Thiago Silva goes through the back of the sub Ramos. That's just a blatant yellow. Not given. Meh. This is dirty, cheap stuff from Brazil. Now Thiago Silva is making out that he's hurt. 53 mins: Marcelo and Hulk the latest Brazilians to foul an opponent. Dunno if this is a deliberate strategy or just over-excitement. Ramos has fouled Luiz, arguably. 51 mins: As it happens, Fernandinho is himself pushed to the ground and Brazil gets a freekick. It's dinked into the box and is quite obviously headed behind by a Zapata for a corner. The ref gives a goalkick. This game could well be settled by some refereeing lunacy. 49 mins: Dunno if the ref maybe thought "this game could get away from me" or what, but he's been blowing on that whistle like Bez at the Hacienda. Brazil putting in some naughty challenges, Luiz dangling a leg and tripping an opponent, while Fernandinho has shoved two people already. 46 mins: We're off for the second half of this somewhat deranged encounter. Ibarbo off and Ramos on for Colombia. HALF TIME: BRAZIL 1 COLOMBIA 0 Phew. Hectic stuff. Bonkers game, in fact. Hardly seems like the same sport that France and Germany were playing a few hours ago. Brazil bundled in a corner early on, there have been loads of mistakes from both sides, plenty of excitement, but not that much quality. Colombia headless chickens. Sense that the referee is clinging on by his fingernails. HT in Fortaleza & Brazil are 1-5 to see off Colombia who are 20-1, 11-2 the draw. If you fancy Brazil for the outright you can back them in-play at 2-1 on Betfair, while Germany are new second favs at 5-2, 4-1 Argentina 45 mins: A break for Colombia, but nothing quite working for them up front. They lose the ball and as the half concludes it is Brazil in the ascendency. That's the half.Neelesh Naik writes: David Luiz scampers forward almost in to the Colombia box. This is more like it. Brazil playing how Brazil should play. If you are Brazil you do not score from corners. Brazil goals have to come the proper way. Must have a dribble, a feint, an outrageous trick and must leave a big smile on our face. Corners huh! Corners are for Germans. 43 mins: Neymar takes it himself, goalie beaten at the far post but it doesn't quite dip enough. 41 mins: Neymar miscontrols and loses it but Zuniga does him a favour by fouling him on the edge of the box. 40 mins: Frantic, barmy stuff so far. Colombia in the game in fits and starts but you'd fancy Brazil to score a second more than a Colombian equaliser. 38 mins: Neymar and Hulk work an opening, the latter smashes it from the inside-left channel. It's "cow's backside with a banjo" time once again from this mystifying player. 36 mins: Freekick gets the big build up but is drilled into the wall. It was tapped to J-Rod, Luiz charged it down. He was nearer than ten yards, no question. 34 mins: Fernandinho is penalsied for a foot up as he challenges with Ibarbo and Cuadrado for the ball. Harshly, I feel - everyone was as guilty as anyone else. Handy freekick position on the edge of the Brazil box. 32 mins: Cuadrado and Rodriguez the only ones doing anything for Colombia. The former with a decent shot, and then the pair combine to force their way into the Brazil box before losing their way with a failed one-two. 31 mins: Hulk and Neymar battering the Colombian backline, wave after wave of attack. No respite. 29 mins: Hilarious run from David Luiz, the ball pinging off him, Colombians grabbing him, him shoving opponents, it was like rugby league or something. 26 mins: Hulk holds it up well, flicks it inside to Marcello, who shoots over. 23 mins: Now it's Brazil's turn to break - Oscar flaps when he should have made Colombia pay for some dozy play. Rodriguez tried to take a quick free kick but Colombia lost it. And yet again! Another Brazil break, these time it's Paulinho who gets into the box and is only just tackled. Superbly open game, loads of mistakes from both sides. More equal now, but whether that's becuase Colombia have raised their game or Brazil have come down to their level I cannot say. 21 mins: But suddenly Colombia can break. Rodriguez carries it forward, they've got four on three, and Cuadrado, who has been poor so far, chooses the wrong option. Should have played in one of the two team-mates surging into the box, or gone himself. Wasted, golden chance. 20 mins: Colombia under the pump and you sense a second goal is coming. 19 mins: Excellent from Brazil, Neymar breaks and Hulk storms forward into the box. Doesn't hit it that well, and the keeper beats it out. Butch Oscar with the follow-up! Saved. Two decents stops in as many seconds. 17 mins: Out of nothing, Colombia fashion a chance for... er, Brazil. Cuadrado tries to dribble out of defence, makes a total hash of it, Hulk gets to the corner of the six yard box, beats Guarin and crosses. Circus time in the Colombia defence, and Armero only just scrambles clear as Luiz looks to pounce. 14 mins: Fernandinho blocks Rodriguez, who makes a massive meal of it. 12 mins: Neymar busy as a bee, harrying the Colombian backs. 10 mins: A bustling, powerful attack from Colombia, Cuadrado involved. Wins a shooting opportunity through brute force and lets fly, not far away. Corner. Cleared. Juan Carlos Gonzalez-Najera writes: Why oh why do the Brazilians insist on playing Fred? He has been invisible all of this tournament and has not collaborated at all. At least he shaved his mustache. 8 mins: Colombia have a freekick from long range. Nope. Nowhere near. GOAL! Corner from the left, everyone has missed it, and Thiago Silva at the back stick comes with a free run. Sanchez has lost his man! It's a soft goal, he's bundled it in off his shin, but at this stage, who cares? Brazil 1 Colombia 0 (Thiago Silva 6) 5 mins: Fernandinho hits one down the channel for Neymar, who has a duel with Zapata. The Colombia back out muscles him. Corner. 3 mins: Lovely pass from Rodriguez finds Gutierrez, but Brazil clean up. Fred and Neymar run into each other. Ah, Samba Football. But luckily for Brazil, Sanchez bundles Fred over. Neymar doesn't do much with the direct free kick. 2 mins: Both sides make two changes. Paulinho for the suspended Luiz Gustavo, Maicon for Dani Alves. Colombia: Fredy Guarin and Victor Ibarbo in for Abel Aguilar and Jackson Martinez. Looks like Carlos Sanchez is going to man-mark Neymar. 1 mins: Colombia kick off and set about it right away, down the left, sling the ball in. 20.59 Genuinely not sure who I want to win. Colombia have been so cool, and my instinct is always to back the underdog... but come on. A World Cup in Brazil? How can you not want them to do well? It's a tricky one alright. Neelesh Naik The Headline in your blog is from the Times of India. Really looking forward to this game. Hope Colombia put a spanner in the works of this mediocre Brazil team Why are Brazil playing in white shorts??? Not cool... first they drop Dani Alves, then insist on picking Fred!!! and now ditching the traditional blue shorts for white! WHY? 20.57 Another inspiring, wonderful, joyful performance of the Brazil anthem. I didn't see any players crying on this occasion. Which should please Big Phil. Manuel Lagos makes a good point: As much as I want Colombia to win I predict a Brazil to win 3 - 0. It just seems Colombia has not faced real opposition in this World Cup yet and Brazil has already battled adversity. 20.56 David Luiz has got a melon stuck on his head. Shame. 20.54 So a fine peformance from the Colombians but they'll have to take second place in the singing stakes to Brazil. 20.53 Sterling effort from the Colombians, skipper especially giving it the full gun. 20.52 And now it's national anthem time. 20.51 The two captains speak out against discrimination. 20.49 And here are the visitors. 20.48 Here's the hosts. 20.46 Reader Francis Mwangi reckons Brazil 1 Colombia 0. 20.45 Here, you'll be wanting a gander at Alan Smith's rundown of the key battles and men to watch. 20.40 Our first email of the blog comes from Ana Gmaez: I am terribly excited, proud and nervous of this Colombia team who have brought this beautiful country to the forefront of the world stage for what we are - warriors, hopefuls in the face of adversity. Lovely stuff. Best of luck to your boys, Ana. 20.35 This is surely the best headline work of the World Cup so far. Not too certain of the paper but, to that sub editor: take a bow, son. 20.30 Predictions time. The great and the good of the Telegraph Sports desk: this is your chance to shine. John MacLeary 2-1 to Brazil in 90 mins. Jim Bruce-Ball reckons 2-1 Brazil in extra time, the greedy devil. Evan Fanning also fancies 2-1 to Brazil in extras, with David Luiz to be the hero. Nick Randall is bucking the trend with a little 2-0 to Colombia action. Me? I reckon penalties, with Brazil to prevail. You? 20.25 Would love to hear the explanation for Maicon replacing Dani Alves. Maicon was the Inter full-back so severely mullered by Tottenham's Gareth Bale in what amounted to the Welshman's coming out party onto the world stage. 20.16 Colombia wear red. The last time they did that in the World Cup was in 1990, when Freddy Rincon scored that blinder against West Germany. Rincon. Maicon. This is making me happy. Let's celebrate with this house banger from Roxanne Shante. 20.14 Bit of newswire copy on that. Brazil's Maicon will make his first appearance of the World Cup, replacing Dani Alves at right back in the side to face Colombia in their World Cup quarter-final on Friday. Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari made one other change to the side that beat Chile on penalties in the last 16, bringing Paulinho into the midfield to replace the suspended Luiz Gustavo. Colombia also made two changes to the team that began their 2-0 defeat of Uruguay in the second round. Midfielders Victor Ibarbo and Fredy Guarin start in place of holding midfielder Abel Aguilar and the more attack-minded Jackson Martinez, who both drop to the bench. 20.12 Woah! Big Phil's obviously madder than I thought. He's gone Maicon. Brazil: Julio Cesar; Maicon, Thiago Silva (capt), David Luiz, Marcelo; Fernandinho, Paulinho; Oscar, Neymar, Hulk; Fred Coach: Luiz Felipe Scolari (BRA) Colombia: David Ospina; Juan Camilo Zuniga, Cristian Zapata, Mario Yepes (capt), Pablo Armero; Fredy Guarin, Carlos Sanchez; Juan Guillermo Cuadrado, James Rodriguez, Victor Ibarbo; Teofilo Gutierrez Coach: Jose Pekerman (ARG) Referee: Carlos Velasco Carballo (ESP) 20.05 On the subject of feeling the pressure, here's Big Phil kicking off, and that's never not an enjoyable prospect. Jeremy Wilson with the story: Luiz Felipe Scolari, the Brazil manager, told his detractors on Thursday night that they could “go to hell” and defiantly claimed that his team would go into Friday night’s World Cup quarter-final against Colombia with “one hand on the trophy”. He's also apparently banned some hacks from the press conference. Scolari said: “There’s no way I can go down to talk to everyone. Those who were not invited it was because maybe I don’t like you that much or, at that time, I didn’t want to talk to you. That’s what I did in 2002 and I will continue to do it. Men can’t be jealous. No. Please. If you like it, you like it. If you don’t, you don’t. Just go to hell.” The impuning of whoever's masculinity, always funny. Classic Phil. 20.00 Sorry I'm just parroting out Michael's column now. But this bit is good, too: Rather like the broader Brazil team, I wasn’t sure if Neymar justified the hype. I’d seen him a few times for Barcelona and Brazil and thought he was an exceptional player, but not worthy of comparison with Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo. Although he has played well in this competition and I’ve been much more impressed with him than I was previously, he is still a level below his Argentinian rival. Should he inspire his country to World Cup success, perhaps he’ll belong on that same pedestal but he has some way to go to reach those heights. Brazil once had an entire team of ‘x-factor’ players, but in this competition the focus has been solely on Neymar – incredible pressure for a 22-year-old. 19.55 As Michael says, Brazil the team have to turn the BRAZIL the myth to their advantage: There are certain teams that possess such a status you can often feel you’re a goal down before you kick off. This is an asset Brazil can use to maximum effect in the latter stages. It just feels different playing against them, as though you expect it to be the toughest, most important game you will ever play. It is this rather than a star-studded line-up containing the world’s best players that is the primary reason they are the team everyone wanted to avoid this summer. Reputation goes a long way. When you face Brazil, you do not just feel you are playing the modern players but the essence of football itself. That can be inspiring to some and inhibiting to others, even more so when you are meeting Brazil on their own turf. 19.50 The hosts though. Blimey. Talk about the weight of expectation. It's not even that they have to beat the teams lined up against them on the other side of that halfway line, they have to equal the heroes from another era. Michael Owen expresses it well: Before the World Cup, I had doubts Brazil possessed the quality to win the tournament. Despite their progress to the quarter-final, I still need convincing. Remove the iconic yellow jerseys, take away the home advantage and assemble the same squad under a different national flag and there is nothing traditionally ‘Brazilian’ about the hosts. They are not the most flamboyant or exciting team in the competition and have not yet reached the standard of their most illustrious predecessors. 19.45 Evening all, Tyers here, indecently excited by the prospect of the tournament's most exciting team (sorry, Russia) and the hosts duking it out. It'd be tempting to say that all the pressure is on Brazil, but you never know how an unfancied, hyped side will really cope at a tournament when it comes down to the nitty-gritty, so I don't think Colombia will necessarily be immune from stress. 19.30 Henry Winter says the World Cup hosts are wary of the threat posed by Colombia's James Rodriguez, while riot police are ready in the event of Brazil being knocked out of the tournament. Estadio Castelao, Fortaleza Kick-off: 21.00 BST. TV: ITV. Team news Brazil (Possible, 4-2-3-1): Cesar; Alves, Silva, Luiz, Marcelo; Fernandinho, Gustavo; Hulk, Oscar, Neymar; Fred. Colombia (Possible, 4-4-2): Ospina; Zúñiga, Zapata, Yepes, Armero; Cuadrado, Aguilar, Sanchez, Rodríguez; Gutiérrez, Martínez. Referee: Carlos Velasco Carballo (Spain). Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari believes the lack of bad blood between his side and Colombia will allow for an attractive spectacle when the two sides clash in their World Cup quarter-final on Friday. Scolari's men needed penalties after a bruising 120 minutes to overcome Chile in the last 16 which left many of the Brazil squad in tears at the end of the match. However, the 65-year-old is hoping a less frenetic encounter will allow his players to show their talent in Fortaleza. "Colombia is a more technical team than Chile," said Scolari. "Chile have more strength and play with a spirit which makes the game dynamics very different. The rivalry with Colombia is not the same as with Chile, Argentina or Uruguay. "It was much more difficult against Chile. Colombia are also a great team with some great players, but when we don't have these rivalries our players feel more at ease." Brazil captain Thiago Silva echoed his coach's words and welcomed the challenge of stopping Colombia's free-scoring attack that has netted 11 times in four games. "For me what is good is a team that comes to play against us and technically Colombia is different in that sense. They have the skills of wanting to play which helps our team," said the Paris Saint-Germain defender on Thursday. "It is better to play these games equally than a team that plays very closed at the back. To play in 15 metres is difficult, but when you have 70 or 80 metres there is more room and freedom for our players to play." Worried that carrying the expectations of 200 million Brazilians is becoming too much for his squad, Scolari called the team's sports psychologist Regina Brandao in for an extra session with the players on Tuesday. And Brazil's star man Neymar said the sessions were having the desired effect. "I had never done anything like it before and I am quite enjoying it," added the 22-year-old. "It is not only us, in football, who are surrounded by emotion every day and need psychologists. I think it could do every person good, to make one more relaxed." Neymar also insisted he will be fully-fit to face the Colombians despite suffering thigh and knee injuries against Chile. One of the major concerns for Scolari, though, has been the lack of support for Neymar in attacking areas as he has scored half of his side's eight goals after four games, whilst other forwards Fred, Jo and Hulk have struggled to make an impact. Scolari is expected to stick by Fred and Hulk, but will be forced into at least one change from the side that faced Chile as Luis Gustavo is suspended. Tottenham Hotspur's Paulinho is the most obvious candidate to replace Gustavo with Manchester City's Fernandinho dropping into a deeper role in midfield. However, Scolari admitted he could also switch formation to a 3-5-2 with Napoli's Henrique joining David Luiz and Silva in central defence. Gustavo's absence is even more critical for the hosts given the sensational form of the tournament's top goalscorer, Colombia's James Rodriguez. The Monaco playmaker has taken on the mantle of his side's focal point with ease in the absence of the injured Radamel Falcao with five goals in four games. A fourth consecutive win for Jose Pekerman's men took them into the last eight for the first time and ahead of the biggest game in Colombian football's history, the Argentine coach insisted the need to keep their feet on the ground. "For Colombia every game is a new challenge and a step up," said the Argentine on Thursday. "Both Brazil and us cannot think about what has gone before. "We need to play our own game as we have done up to now and try to impose our play on them. The key is not to believe there is a favourite." History, though, is against the Colombians as they have only beaten Brazil twice in 25 previous meetings and only once in a competitive fixture at the 1991 Copa America.

Holland v Costa Rica: Louis van Gaal hopes superstition can guide the Dutch to World Cup glory - Telegraph	“I was given it because her children made it and I promised to wear it. I will wear it again, of course. “I will always wear it when I'm coach of Holland and that is another three matches, as you know.” Aside from superstition, Van Gaal admits he is relying on the influence of the senior figures in the Dutch squad to navigate a path to the semi-finals at the expense of Costa Rica. “We have four or five older players and the influence of these is quite substantial,” Van Gaal said. “We have a young group and Robin (van Persie) is the captain, the man responsible for the younger ones. “He does that with (Arjen) Robben, (Dirk) Kuyt and (Wesley) Sneijder. That's good and pleasant for a coach to have players who will do everything it takes and look after the young players, in the spirit of the coach. I'm pleased with that. “Like the Costa Rica players, the rest don’t have experience of this level of football, but our senior guys mean we have a slight advantage.” The Dutch go into the game at Arena Fonte Nova having fought back from a goal down to win in three of their four games so far in Brazil. And Van Gaal claims the fighting qualities make up for the lack of ‘fantastic’ ability in his squad. “Our goal is to become world champions and we are a team that is difficult to beat,” Van Gaal said. “We are not a fantastic team, but we're very difficult to beat. “We have shown that so far and hope we can keep it up until the final. “We haven't played so well in possession, but when the opposition have the ball we are one of the best teams, if not the best, with individual qualities and skills. “But the best 23 players will win this World Cup. That will remain. Even if we lose and go out, we will fight to the very last minute to become champions.” - Feyenoord talent factory rolls out stars for Holland - Holland v Costa Rica: match preview	sports

World Cup 2014: Feyenoord's thriving talent factory rolls out the stars for glory chasers Holland - Telegraph	Yet with Feyenoord only choosing to revive their once-famed academy in 2009 owing to crippling debts which exceeded €50 million (£39.6 million), Holland may been forced to tackle this World Cup without the Rotterdam connection. “The idea of playing young players came through necessity, because of financial problems,” said Damien Hertog, the Feyenoord Academy director. “There is no point lying about it. It was so successful, though, that we have now made it our policy, that we will always look to bring through new generations. “But the World Cup has been massive for us in stimulating the kids we have here. They have always had the example of someone like De Vrij, who they used to see around the academy and then a year later was in the first team. That path has always been visible to them, but now they can see him, Martins Indi, Jordy Clasie at a World Cup. They can imagine themselves at that same level.” Fourteen of Feyenoord’s current first-team squad have been developed by the club since 2009 and such has been the success of the project that Varkenoord has won the Rinus Michels Award for best academy – voted for by fellow Eredivisie clubs – in each year of its existence. Martins Indi and De Vrij have led the new wave, having been challenged to sink or swim when the financial crisis was at its most perilous and funds were not available for reinforcements. Both players prospered, to the extent that the pair of them, and Janmaat, are expected to be sold following the World Cup in order to help fund the construction of a new 75,000-seat stadium. But Hertog is confident about the future of the club and their ability to produce more players. “We have a way of working that has been producing players,” Hertog said. “Things have changed bit by bit, but the biggest difference is that now the club have a policy of giving young players opportunities in the first team. That means they can develop even more. “But our policy is not just that kids will play. They have to be good enough. We do not ask much of them, but we demand a high work rate, a good mentality and a willingness to invest in themselves. “Keeping the gap small between our first team and academy is really important. Every season, when there is a game at De Kuip, we present all of the youth teams that have been champions to the crowd and they get a big cheer, but they all know the first-team players.” As Holland captain and a global star at Manchester United, Van Persie remains the most recognisable face from the Feyenoord youth set-up, having been recruited by Arsenal in 2004 after three years in the Feyenoord first team. Hertog admits that the 30-year-old retains a connection to the club and their efforts to produce young talent. “There is a Robin van Persie tournament every year for the very little ones,” Hertog said. “He came back last year – there is a really sweet video of him doing tricks with some of the very small boys. His son, Shaqueel, trained with us for the first time a couple of weeks ago. “There is a phrase about Feyenoord, ‘Geen Worden Maar Daden’, not words but deeds. That is the sort of club we are. Our fans want players to work, like they do. They want them to chase opponents down, to play at a high intensity. “But everyone thinks Feyenoord is only work, that Ajax is where the stylish players come from. We are able to mix the two, and we have been quite successful at it in the last few years.” - Van Gaal banking on lucky bracelet - Holland v Costa Rica: match preview	sports

But Hertog is confident about the future of the club and their ability to produce more players. “We have a way of working that has been producing players,” Hertog said. “Things have changed bit by bit, but the biggest difference is that now the club have a policy of giving young players opportunities in the first team. That means they can develop even more. “But our policy is not just that kids will play. They have to be good enough. We do not ask much of them, but we demand a high work rate, a good mentality and a willingness to invest in themselves. “Keeping the gap small between our first team and academy is really important. Every season, when there is a game at De Kuip, we present all of the youth teams that have been champions to the crowd and they get a big cheer, but they all know the first-team players.” As Holland captain and a global star at Manchester United, Van Persie remains the most recognisable face from the Feyenoord youth set-up, having been recruited by Arsenal in 2004 after three years in the Feyenoord first team. Hertog admits that the 30-year-old retains a connection to the club and their efforts to produce young talent. “There is a Robin van Persie tournament every year for the very little ones,” Hertog said. “He came back last year – there is a really sweet video of him doing tricks with some of the very small boys. His son, Shaqueel, trained with us for the first time a couple of weeks ago. “There is a phrase about Feyenoord, ‘Geen Worden Maar Daden’, not words but deeds. That is the sort of club we are. Our fans want players to work, like they do. They want them to chase opponents down, to play at a high intensity. “But everyone thinks Feyenoord is only work, that Ajax is where the stylish players come from. We are able to mix the two, and we have been quite successful at it in the last few years.” - Van Gaal banking on lucky bracelet - Holland v Costa Rica: match preview	sports
World Cup 2014: Costa Rica winger Christian Bolaños claims country can reach final ahead of Holland tie - Telegraph	“We have come this far, so we will continue in the same way,” Bolaños said. “It is Holland next and the game is 50-50, but this is football. I had a feeling that this team was built to win things. Hopefully we will have luck, which is important in football, but why can’t we get to the final? “We will enjoy the moment, but we have a lot of confidence in us. It is a young group, but one that has a lot of ambition and has done a lot of work to get to this point. Nobody said we would win the group, scoring four goals, but here we are so let people keep talking.” Costa Rica would become the first team from the Concacaf region – North and Central America – to reach a World Cup semi-final since the United States in 1930 with victory over the Dutch. History beckons, but FC Copenhagen winger Bolaños admits the scale of Costa Rica’s success has yet to sink in. “It is hard for one person in one sentence,” Bolaños said. “We do not understand the scale of it, but with time, we will understand it better. This is something historic for our country, but now is not the moment to analyse. “The reality is that we do not know what we are achieving at the moment, but it is a prize for this group, for the country.” World Cup digital simulation Holland v Costa Rica, as it may happen...	sports
Leicester City consider £5m bid for Sunderland striker Connor Wickham - Telegraph	Wickham played a huge role in securing Sunderland's survival last season, with five goals in three crucial games, but is facing an uncertain future at the Stadium of Light. Wickham has one year left on his contract and, while Sunderland have opened talks over a new deal, Leicester are preparing an ambitious bid to bring him to the King Power Stadium. Pearson is keen to sign a powerful forward this summer following Leicester's return to the Premier League and has already seen three bids rejected for Brighton & Hove Albion striker Leonardo Ulloa. Now Wickham has emerged as a serious target and Leicester are ready to test whether Sunderland will sell. Wickham was signed from Ipswich Town for an initial £8 million in 2011. - Club-by-club guide to the transfer window - Transfer Talk: All the latest news and gossip	sports
Mats Hummels could teach the English game so much – he embodies Germany's strength - Telegraph	The hero of this hot, clammy last-eight game at the Maracana is emblematic of German strength in the talent production department. The Franz Beckenbauer comparisons are not frivolous. He was part of the class of 2009 who won the European Under-21 Championship and graduated en masse to the senior team at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Too ill with flu-like symptoms to play in the second-round game against Algeria – a real melodrama which emboldened Germany’s critics back home – he shook off his lethargy to start alongside Jerome Boateng, with Arsenal’s Per Mertesacker on the bench. “I was flat this morning and had to drink loads of water after the game,” Hummels said. On 12 minutes he made his decisive intervention, at the expense of Raphael Varane, the talented Real Madrid centre-back who is France’s best defensive prospect. When Toni Kroos lifted and dropped a perfect fee-kick into France’s penalty box Hummels displaced Varane with the power of his jump and headed the ball past Hugo Lloris. This early statement of German intent failed to ignite the game. Instead Joachim Löw’s team settled into a pattern of containment, with occasional lightning breaks, but without the cool finishing touch they needed to finish France off. Thomas Müller and Andre Schürrle (who came on for Miroslav Klose) were wasteful around Lloris’s area. At the other end, Benzema deceived Philipp Lahm with a twisting move on 74 minutes but Hummels threw his body in the way of the shot. Nothing gives a centre-back greater satisfaction than scoring from a set-piece and then thwarting the opposition with some penalty box derring-do. Hummels’ gift for reading the game is a long-standing entry in scouting notebooks. If he came to England – to Manchester United, say – he would lay on an education for young English centre-backs, who need to step up on the current bunch: Phil Jagielka, Gary Cahill, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling. To judge those players in isolation from those around them – in defensive midfield especially – is perhaps unkind, but the general talent gap is big. Hummels looks forward and sees Sami Khedira and Bastian Schweinsteiger screening the back-four. He also sees Kroos, who had posted more touches (473) than anyone from any team at this World Cup. Lahm, the right-back here, was the only other to have passed 400. These stats explain how Germany nailed Portugal 4-0 in their opening group game and came through a tough second fixture against Ghana to cut a path to yet another semi-final. Adverse comment back home has rattled them, but not enough to flatten their spirits. “I don’t want to win the World Cup and have to say afterwards 'sorry that we only won by one goal’,” Müller said. “Criticism is good, but without losing perspective. The way things have been interpreted and transmitted is wrong. The criticism is caused by the great level of expectation.” Surely now the jury will acknowledge the breadth and depth of Germany’s squad, their ability to replace starters with almost equally good replacements, their unity. This was the 13th time in 20 attempts they have reached the last four at a World Cup. Most of us would still argue that the German model is the one English football would be best-advised to copy, assuming the Premier League clubs would allow it (unlikely), with regional academies and the needs of the national team being given equal billing. Certainly there is no young Mats Hummels in the English game, unless John Stones can progress in that direction, which is a purely hopeful statement, not based on hard evidence. The flu could not stop this Germany side. They are Europe’s strongest contenders.	sports
World Cup 2014: Feyenoord's thriving talent factory rolls out the stars for glory chasers Holland - Telegraph	Yet with Feyenoord only choosing to revive their once-famed academy in 2009 owing to crippling debts which exceeded €50 million (£39.6 million), Holland may been forced to tackle this World Cup without the Rotterdam connection. “The idea of playing young players came through necessity, because of financial problems,” said Damien Hertog, the Feyenoord Academy director. “There is no point lying about it. It was so successful, though, that we have now made it our policy, that we will always look to bring through new generations. “But the World Cup has been massive for us in stimulating the kids we have here. They have always had the example of someone like De Vrij, who they used to see around the academy and then a year later was in the first team. That path has always been visible to them, but now they can see him, Martins Indi, Jordy Clasie at a World Cup. They can imagine themselves at that same level.” Fourteen of Feyenoord’s current first-team squad have been developed by the club since 2009 and such has been the success of the project that Varkenoord has won the Rinus Michels Award for best academy – voted for by fellow Eredivisie clubs – in each year of its existence. Martins Indi and De Vrij have led the new wave, having been challenged to sink or swim when the financial crisis was at its most perilous and funds were not available for reinforcements. Both players prospered, to the extent that the pair of them, and Janmaat, are expected to be sold following the World Cup in order to help fund the construction of a new 75,000-seat stadium.

World Cup 2014: Germany manager Joachim Low says foreigners in Premier League are damaging England - Telegraph	“Since 2009 things have changed for us and lots of young German players are coming through. We have a good blend, a strong league with three teams who are among the best in Europe with experience in tough competitions but I am not unhappy if some play in a foreign country and see other cultures and other coaches. “Mesut Özil and Sami Khedira do for example and that can be of value and they can learn new things so I think it is valuable if the individual players go abroad.” Only around a third of Premier League players are English while 60 per cent of players in the Bundesliga are German. Löw confirmed that defender Mats Hummels was available after an illness and the Borussia Dortmund centre-back is expected to return with right-back Shkodran Mustafi out injured.The only uncertainty is whether Philipp Lahm plays as right-back or as a holding midfielder. Löw admitted Germany had played “very poorly” in the first half of the 2-1 win over Algeria but that had “proved they could fight”. Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer played a key role against Germany, often operating as a sweeper a long way outside of his area, and Löw said the Bayern Munich stopper is so technically good that he could even play in midfield. He added: “If a team tries to play high the way we did against USA and Algeria the keeper cannot just stay in his box. Manuel Neuer has the same technical skills as the others, he could play in the midfield, he also has great awareness and that’s why we are happy for him to take these risks, and that’s why he’s so valuable. He can basically be a player behind the defence.” Meanwhile, Bayern Munich midfielder Toni Kroos told a news conference that there had been do decision over his future despite reports in Spain that he has agreed to move to Real Madrid. Kroos said: “I want to concentrate on the World Cup and as soon as this tournament is over a decision will be taken – nothing has been decided.” Germany’s leading scorer Thomas Müller believes criticism of the performance against Algeria was exaggerated. “The way things have been interpreted and transmitted is wrong,” he said. “We have won what was a tight game. Even if we had to go through extra-time to get it, we deserved to go through. We weren’t up against a Mickey Mouse team.”	sports

France vs Germany, World Cup 2014: live - Telegraph	Here's Henry Winter's match report. Thanks for reading, please join me for Brazil vs Colombia: live (kickoff 9pm BST) 93 mins: Not that they have especially deserved it, but the French suddenly have a chance. The first signs of nerves in the German defence, and they don't clear properly. Here's Benzema in the inside left channel, hard shot at the keeper but never likely to beat Neuer from this angle... the French chance has gone and that's the lot. 91 mins: Fittingly on the 25th anniversary of Seinfeld first airing, Kramer is coming on for the Germans. Kroos off. 90 mins: Germans doing a good, professional, efficient, etc etc etc job of sewing this up, winning fouls when they need to. 89 mins: We're going to have four minutes of extra time. The French know the matches are only an hour and half long, right? 87 mins: Muller skins Evra and Schurrle has a dream chance to finish this. His shot is blocked by Varane, who bravely/accidentally blocks the ball with his gentleman's area. 86 mins: Germany mounting an over-confident attack as Boateng the centre half charges forward. Easy tiger. 84 mins: Giroud's replaced Valbuena. France, again, seem less... I dunno... bovvered than you would expect from a team six minutes away from going home. 83 mins: Germans have a corner, Neuer is on the halfway line. I would LOVE it if all this sweeper-keeper thing ended up with him getting lobbed from distance. Corner half cleared. 80 mins: Ball into the box, nearly disater for the Germans, Hoewedes has headed it at the back of Hummels. Would have been a comedy OG. In fact, it's a corner. The Germans break fast and true, and they're looking at 2-0 here... several men forward, crossed across for Schurrle who has all the time in the world. Ah, he's hit it straight at the keeper. 79 mins: Germany solid, not really attacked much of late, but here's Lahm. He loses it and Schweinsteiger feels obliged to trip up the breaking French midfielder, Griezmann I think. 76 mins: Cheryl Matuidi draws a reasonable save out of Neuer, but realistically he was never going to beat him from the angle. 75 mins: Shame, unlucky France. It's crossed over the box from the right, Benzema plucks it out the air and does pretty well to get a shot away. But he had not, and could not have, seen Balbuena on his left, arriving late in the area and in an even better position. 74 mins: Muller and Ozil cut France open, but the French defence are well back. 72 mins: Valbuena shows great control to pick it up on the inside left but his shot is lacking. 71 mins: Remy on for Cabaye. The French seem a bit.... unruffled. Not been a great urgency about their play. 70 mins: France have runners but Griezmann goes for a silly shot. 69 mins: Koscielny in for Sakho. 68 mins: This exchange. Sake. Jonathan Pearce: "There was an interesting documentary the other night about false nines, have you seen any tactical innovations at this World Cup?" Mark Lawrenson: "No." 66 mins: Klose has run his race, Schurrle comes on. Greg Bee writes: On the subject of J-Lo's shirts (no, not her), surely the obvious candidate as the new Germany manager is Pep-Guard, given that he dressed like Milk Tray Man during the Champs League last season? Azet agrees: "I always love Lowe's fashion style from the beginning. Elegent as always!" 65 mins: There's a lot of jeering in the stadium, Jonathan Pearce reckons it is in protest against goal-line technology Brazil fans unhappy that the game has got a bit cagey. 62 mins: Classy veterans match down this side as Evra crosses but Lahm makes the clearance. Benzema wrongly blown up for hands from the corner. 61 mins: Shades of Toni as Schweinsteiger leaps shoulder first into Valbeuna. Looked worse than it was, I think. 59 mins: Here's Matuidi on the break after a poor header from Boateng. Schewini hacks it out for a corner. Ball's eventually back in but Varane's header is never going to trouble Neuer. 55 mins: Griezmann sends Valbuena through but the ball's overhit. Kroos goes for am ambitious long range effort. P Kovak: Germany will beat france but holland will win the cup Kiran Kulkarni says: I feel Loic Remy could turn out to be a trump card with his pace & dynamism..Deschamps shouldn't wait till 80th minute to bring him on.. Giroud can be given a night off as he is too static & will not make things happen on his own. Alan White writes: Watching on a tiny tv on a French campsite so rooting for France. Germany started 2nd half rather too well. Allez les Bleus!!! 53 mins: Griezmann breaks, it's opening up for the French here, but Khedira knows what he has to do: he drags him to the ground and accepts the yellow card without a murmur. 51 mins: Really good ball forward but Griezmann's control lets him down. 49 mins: A nothing freekick, Valbuena lifts it in quickly, Evra nearly gets on it. Miles offside but the linesman does not flag. Half the ground is in shadow, half in blinding sunlight - maybe he cannot see? 47 mins: Schweinsteiger with a nice judo move on Griezmann, getting his foot behind the Frenchman's calf and using his opponent's own bodyweight to haul him down. I am scoring it an Ippon. Surprisingly, given that this happened in the penalty area, the French don't claim for a foul. 46 mins: France will kick us off. No changes as far as I can see. Good bit of pundity by Rio at half time about Varane got bullied by the German goalscorer, should have been more aggressive and not let Hummels "put his hands on him", which sounded vaguely indecent. Neat start from France. HALF TIME: FRANCE 0 GERMANY 1 Good match, German composure and passing probably just shading it over some nice French movement, but there are spaces behind the German high back line and France, notably through Valbuena, have been able to get in behind a couple of them. Gary Lineker gets off a good one, saying “The German manager was not afraid to leave out a big player – Ruud, have you any experience of that in your own managerial career?” Alan Shearer enjoys the joke. Let's grab a few emails, Craig Sobering, why don't you kick us off? Tough one for me today as these are two of my favorite teams after Holland. Was a bit concerned to hear that much of the German team is suffering from the flu - that will make things tougher in the heat and humidity down there. Considering that and some of the weaker performances from the Germans later in the tournament I think the French are more likely to advance. Hoping for an exciting match whichever way the cards fall. And Soren writes: So far the match plan went just as expected. France attack - when it comes - is really fast, but the German defenders are mostly there. And a header for the lead. No complete fail, as Götze was against Algeria. One half to go for the fourth semifinal in a row - that'd be an academy record! 44 mins: Only going to be a minute of added time. 42 mins: Benzema with a twisty-tosty run after a ball from the highly exciting Pogba, but the shot doesn't measure up. 40 mins: France! That looked a decent shout for a handball. Cheryl Matuidi with the ball from the left, Benzema connects with a header, it hits Hummels in the breadbasket. Yeah no handball actually. 38 mins: Pogba's skinned Schweinsteiger! I think we can all enjoy that. 37 mins: Game slows down, indeed stops, and some players have decided they want a drink. 35 mins: Khedira and Kroos nearly smuggle the ball through a well-packed French line. Muller bursting through. Lawro is in especially miserable form this afternoon, by the way. He's furious that Sami Khedira has been hit in the face by the ball. "Ooh what a shock, man playing football hit in face by football," carps the Preston Pouter. 33 mins: Super save from Neuer, one hander to deny Valbuena from a tight angle, Benzema nearly spoons the follow up over the keeper but there are too many Germans in attendance. A couple of decent corners from France ensue. 32 mins: Germans getting full use of the lovely Maracana grass, Muller the latest to have a little lie down in the French penalty area. And why not? Debuchy was within three feet of him, or even closer. 29 mins: A ball into the France box, Howaaaaaydes has a go at it and the ref seems to be the only one in the stadium who reckons that this is a corner. But a corner it is. No alarm for France. 25 mins: Khedira sends Muller through and Lloris charges out to deny him. 23 mins: Klose is into the box! Debuchy goes with him and might well be grabbing his shirt. If Klose hadn't dived QUITE so theatrically the ref might have given him a pen there. Ridiculous dive. Klose prepares for take-off 22 mins: France build down the right, but Hummels and his defensive colleagues are well aware of the threat Griezmann poses and he is well marshalled. 20 mins: Neat play by the French but not quite with the pace or verve to rattle the Germans at the moment. 15 mins: That goal for Germany has been sandwiched by some really attractive attacking play by France, Valbuena to the fore. GOAL! A good spell of play from the French is rudely curtailed when the Germans win a freekick on the left, thanks to a foolish foul from Pogba. Ball in... Hummels gets the better of Varane at the back post and powers home the header. Excellent delivery from Toni Kroos. France 0 Germany 1 (Hummels 13) 10 mins: Valbuena’s now popped upon the right and Germany clear, just about. Now Antonie Griezmann's turn to make a fine run and his cross is only barely cut out by Hummels 8 mins: Klose and Khedira link up quite well but the ball rolls through to Lloris. He sensibly slows the game down... And out of the bleu France produce a neat bit of play, the busy Valbuena gets in behind the left back Hoewedes I DON'T WANNA HAVE TO DO THE I TOLD YOU SO DANCE BUT I DID SAY THAT MIGHT HAPPEN, JOACHIM and he crosses for Benzema, who probably should have done better 6 mins: France look off the pace, Evra's chopped down Muller. 4 mins: French should ask the ref if he's got a spare ball, Germany won't them have a go with this one. 2 mins: Germany with much of the ball, France hanging back, they've strung five across midfield. Sakho dithers and Muller makes a good run and cross, it's hoofed clear. 1 mins: Germany lose it cheaply but their high-pressing line harries the French before anything can come of it. Lahm indeed at right back. 17.02 Germany will kick off. 17.01 Quite a bit of anti-racism. Now we've got a big banner. Jonathan Pearce worries that the players are having to stand out there in the heat. 30 degrees. Perhaps technophobe Pearce is upset about the newfangled banner. 16.59 Stirring performance of two top-notch anthems. Here are the France team: 16.55 The captains of France and Germany now each read out a statement about how they're all anti-racism, it's to do with a FIFA Anti-Discrimination day. 16.53 All Europeans now, as Basil Fawlty so wisely put it. These English folks are supporting Germany. 16.48 Oh was it Theirry? I missed the start. Baudelaire's 'Elevation', according to a man on the internets. Next up: Alan Shearer reads the works of Sylvia Plath. 16.45 Goodness gracious it's all gone very French over on BBC. Some moody ambient music, a man reciting a poem in Foreign. I expect someone will have a love triangle or fall off their bike or stab themselves in the eye any moment now. 16.42 Funnily enough, you would fancy Neuer for a massive foul coming out the box, wouldn't you? Not necessarily a violent or vicious one, but all that charging out and trying to tackle. And funnily enough, just as I type this, they're talking about it on the telly. "It's high risk football, if it doens't come off it's a red card," says Rio Ferdinand. 16.40 A film, and a discussion about the Toni Schumacher and that foul of fouls. CAn you imagine the internet drama if it happened now? 16.38 These people are showing off their colours. For any readers who don't speak French, the message on their t-shirts reads 'France', which is French for France. 16.30 It's Rio! Yay! And Alan Shearer. Ok. And Shexy Ruud Gullitsh! Great. 16.29 There's a little preview thing in a theatre. Hey if Germany win, they will reach a record fourth consecutive semi final. 16.28 I always get a little frisson during the World Cup while the titles of the TV shows are playing. Who will be on pundit detail? 16.25 Anyway, that's enough tennising. Here comes football. 16.20 "Email that has made me the most jealous" award goes to Richard Piercy, who says: Holidaying in Vegas to celebrate my girlfriends 40th and glued to your match coverage from beside the pool. Going to see Cirque de Soleil later wonder which will have more diving and acrobatics? Oh man, that sounds like a lot of fun. Hope you both have a great time. Remember to drink and gamble irresponsibly. 16.15 First email of the day honour goes to Søren H. Assmann Stuck at work. Won't join the game till at least 15 minutes in. That being said, the lineup gives France credit. The German lineup. Taking out his slowest defender, Mertesacker, moving the fastest, Boateng into the middle, knowing that France scored all of their goals from inside the box this World Cup, shows Löw is actually adjusting to meet France's attack. Don't underestimate Höwedes. He isn't the fastest, but near unbeatable in a direct 1:1, he's there to prevent the pass to the outside and flanks into the box. Which is the exact tactic Germany will use up front - bringing Klose up front instead of the small Götze is putting up a serious header challenge to the France defense, plus another prime assist-giver. If Boateng and Hummels harmonize, and Schweinsteiger and Khedira become the prime couple they were in the last tournament, France will have one hell of a day to get their attack machine going. 16.08 One of the features of Germany's match with Algeria was the goalkeeping of Manuel Neuer, hurtling out of his goal like a big aul mad one. Paul Hayward has the skinny: The tournament's outstanding keeper possesses all the talents of an outfield player and has been likened to the great Franz Beckenbauer A German goalie charging off his line to engage a French attacker is not a happy image after Harald Schumacher’s levelling of Patrick Battiston in 1982. If Manuel Neuer surges out of his goal at the Maracana, the effect will be more Beckenbauer than bulldozer. Joachim Löw, the Germany coach, thinks Neuer could “play in midfield” and Toni Kroos, who fills one of those positions, calls him the team’s “11th outfield player.” In a tournament of “high” German pressure, Bayern Munich’s keeper is reinventing the last line of defence. “This is the class of Manuel Neuer. He can basically play as a player behind the defenders,” Löw said in Rio. “He can basically pass like an outfield player.” Read more of that here, most interesting stuff. 16.02 Talking, as we were a few minutes ago, of betting, Betfair are paying all money back as a free bet, on selected markets, if any of today's quarter finals games go to extra time. See more about that here. You'd have to fancy this France-Germany to go to 120 minutes, surely? 16.00 Here are the brave men and true who will be lining up shortly. 15.57 I'm considerably more interested in the football. Talking of telly, a nice modest tweet from the nice and modest Richard Keys. 15.55 A tennis is happening on BBC TV at the moment, Dimitrov and Djokovic going at it, Rob Bagchi is the man blogging for us. 15.53 Chelsea's Schurrle is a bit unlucky to be on the bench, I reckon. And Arsenal's Ozil can probably count himself on the fortunate side. 15.52 Here are the full teams France: 1-Hugo Lloris; 2-Mathieu Debuchy, 4-Raphael Varane, 5-Mamadou Sakho, 3-Patrice Evra; 6-Yohan Cabaye; 8-Mathieu Valbuena, 14-Blaise Matuidi, 19-Paul Pogba; 10-Karim Benzema, 11-Antoine Griezmann Substitutes: 7-Remy Cabella, 9-Olivier Giroud, 12-Rio Mavuba, 13-Eliaquim Mangala, 15-Bacary Sagna, 16-Stephane Ruffier, 17-Lucas Digne, 18-Moussa Sissoko, 20-Loic Remy, 21-Laurent Koscielny, 22-Morgan Schneiderlin, 23-Mickael Landreau Germany: 1-Manuel Neuer; 20-Jerome Boateng, 5-Mats Hummels, 4-Benedikt Hoewedes; 6-Sami Khedira, 7-Bastian Schweinsteiger, 16-Philipp Lahm, 18-Toni Kroos, 8-Mesut Ozil; 13-Thomas Mueller, 11-Miroslav Klose Substitutes: 2-Kevin Grosskreutz, 3-Matthias Ginter, 9-Andre Schuerrle, 10-Lukas Podolski, 12-Ron-Robert Zieler, 14-Julian Draxler, 15-Erik Durm, 17-Per Mertesacker, 19-Mario Goetze, 21-Shkodran Mustafi, 22-Roman Weidenfeller, 23-Chrisoph Kramer 15.50 Well, assuming that's true, it makes sense. Always seemed odd, to these untutored eyes at least, why he was playing one of the world's best fullbacks in centre midfield, and having two centre-halves playing in the full-back positions. 15.45 Wow, a bit of a curve ball from Loew by the sounds of it... 15.40 Reading Alan Smith's assessement seems to me to bear out what the bookies are saying: Germany around 15/8, France a best-priced 19/10, and the draw in 90 minutes 21/10. in other words, it's ascloseasthis. 15.35 A really excellent preview piece here from Alan Smith (the Arsenal one!) in which he runs the rule over the expected starting XIs. France vs Germany: The players rated head-to-head 15.30 A video for your enjoyment. Joachim Löw is confident despite the illness that has been troubling some of his squad. 15.25 Aside from the Central and Southern American teams, France have been one of the most enjoyable surprises of the tournament so far. So pacy! So lethal in front of goal! So not trying to stab the coach in the back and going on strike! Truly, these are les bonnes temps, for our French friends. 15.20 Afternoon all. Alan Tyers here. Welcome to our live blog of the first quarter final. Two proper big boys of European football, two properly exciting football teams. Hard to see any obvious weaknesses: perhaps the German full-back Howedes, a converted centre-half could be vulnerable to a Frenchman running in behind. The talented Mathieu Debuchy can be positionally supect. But, really, you're nit-picking. Two classy outfits. France vs Germany Estadio Maracana, Rio de Janeiro Kick-off: 17.00 BST TV: BBC ONE Team news France (Possible, 4-2-1-3): Lloris; Debuchy, Varane, Sakho, Evra; Matuidi, Cabaye; Pogba; Valbuena, Benzema, Griezman. Germany (Possible, 4-3-3): Neuer; Hummels, Boateng, Mertesacker, Howedes; Schweinsteiger, Lahm, Kroos; Özil, Müller, Götze. Referee: Nestor Pitana (Argentina). Under-fire Germany face rejuvenated France in Friday's World Cup quarter-final at Rio de Janeiro's iconic Maracana stadium in a clash of two European powerhouses. This represents an acid test for Germany coach Joachim Loew after eight years in charge with his side heavily criticised at home for below-par performances at Brazil 2014. A place in Tuesday's semi-final against either Brazil or Colombia in Belo Horizonte is at stake. "Didier Deschamps has turned France around since 2010 and we're looking forward to another classic," said Loew who took charge after the 2006 World Cup. The German camp has been blighted by illness in the build-up with Loew revealing seven of his squad have suffered with light 'flu symptoms and sore throats. The full squad trained at the Maracana on Thursday and Loew is relishing the "magic" of the knock-out stages, but says a good result takes precedence over a good performance. Their 4-0 hammering of Portugal in their opening group match confirmed their status amongst the world's elite. But having been held to a 2-2 draw by Ghana, then grinding out a 1-0 win over the USA in their final group match, poor finishing saw Germany labour to a 2-1 extra-time win over Algeria in Monday's last 16 clash. Former captains Michael Ballack, Oliver Kahn and Lothar Matthaeus have all questioned Loew's selections with playmaker Mesut Ozil struggling and centre-backs Jerome Boateng and Benedikt Hoewedes being played out of position as wing-backs. Loew has a contract with the German FA (DFB) until June 2016, but a quarter-final exit will put him under pressure to resign despite steering his side to the semi-finals of the last three major tournaments. The Germany boss says his side's best football at Brazil 2014 is still to come. "We have not yet delivered our best possible performances, that is to come still," Loew told a press conference here Thursday. "This isn't some easy-to-figure out computer game and your own team isn't always easy to programme, but you have to find the right combinations. "You either win and stay or lose and go home." In contrast, France have risen steadily under their coach Deschamps and are unrecognisable from their chaotic 2010 campaign in South Africa. With Karim Benzema in top form, France are dreaming of their first World Cup title since their 1998 triumph on home soil, but their focus is solely on Germany. "There is no apprehension or fear. There is no reason for us to feel any," said Deschamps. "Germany are a solid side with lots of experience of this level but this game will be a pleasure for us and we are preparing ourselves as well as possible for it." Honours are even in terms of recent meetings with France claiming a 2-1 win in Bremen in February 2012, while Germany claimed revenge by the exact same scoreline in Paris 12 months later. The French lead the series with 11 wins to Germany's eight in 25 previous meetings. Both sides played down the relevance of their legendary 1982 World Cup semi-final, which Germany won 5-4 on penalties after a dramatic 3-3 extra-time draw. The Seville game attained notoriety when Germany keeper Harald Schumacher shoulder-charged Patrick Battiston, leaving the Frenchman unconscious on the ground. With the media quick to ask whether France can claim some World Cup revenge, both Loew and Deschamps pointed to the fact most of their respective players were not born at the time. Germany should have centre-back Mats Hummels back after missing the Algeria win with flu, while Lukas Podolski is fit again after a thigh strain. There is a question mark over France defender Raphael Varane, who spent the night in hospital with dehydration after Monday's 2-0 win over Nigeria in the last 16. Liverpool defender Mamadou Sakho is fit again after knee problems, while it remains to be seen who Deschamps names as striker between Olivier Giroud or Antoine Griezmann.

World Cup 2014: Sheffield United and Leeds United remember Argentina manager Alex Sabella – a man bidding for the World Cup - Telegraph	Adjusting to the training methods at Bramall Lane was said to be a particular issue, with Sabella preferring to reserve energy on the eve of matches rather than over-exert on Friday mornings. Sabella adjusted and was a success at Sheffield United, but when the club were relegated in 1980 a £400,000 move to Elland Road followed. At Leeds there is a recollection of an import by now fully immersed in English football culture. Ex-Elland Road team-mate Paul Hart, who went on to become an esteemed coach and manager in his own right at various clubs, is thrilled at how Sabella’s career has progressed. “He was a very talented midfielder with lots of skill. Everyone took to him straight away,” Hart recalls. “It was a very tough transition for anyone to come from Argentina to England at that time. He’d done well at Sheffield United and what I remember of Alex was him being always very professional. I’m so pleased for him that he is doing so well. “One of the reasons everyone took to him instantly at Leeds because he was a genuinely good guy. "He was no trouble to anyone, took to life in this country and showed a great deal of character to come over here to play his football at a time when – apart from the likes of Ardiles at Spurs – it wasn’t so common.” Clues that Sabella would go on to lead one of the game’s superpowers were not plentiful in those days. “It would be difficult to say any of us thought then we would go on to become managers,” Hart said. “It was not something you thought about as players. I would not have considered going into coaching myself at the time but it is credit to Alex he has made such excellent progress. “I can remember in 1996 going to watch Argentina in a friendly against the Republic of Ireland and Alex was the assistant to the great centre-half Daniel Passarella, who was then in charge of the Argentina team. We had a great chat and he presented me with an Argentina jersey which I still treasure.” Sabella left Leeds after a year, unable to cement a permanent place in the side and eager to return to South America where his coaching credentials became more obvious. If the suggestion he was the alternative to Maradona in Sheffield is more myth than reality, it proved a prophecy in his homeland as he took over the national side following the erratic reigns of Diego and Sergio Batista. “He is a coach who transmits tranquillity to the team,” said former Argentina captain Juan Sebastián Verón. Should Sabella become the first Argentina manager since Carlos Bilardo to win the World Cup, the journey from being Maradona-lite to a footballing legend in his own right will be complete. “He has a great chance and I’ll be hoping Argentina do it because of Alex,” said Hart. The parade of club legends decorating the walls in Sheffield and Leeds may not yet have found space for Sabella. Should he achieve his ambition over the next week, the Bramall Lane and Elland Road Hall of Fame will need refurbishing with the image of a World Cup winner. - Maradona: Argentina cannot rely on Messi - We are more than just Messi, claims Sabella - Alan Hansen: Eden Hazard needs to deliver against Argentina - Argentina v Belgium: match preview	sports
World Cup 2014: Germany manager Joachim Low says foreigners in Premier League are damaging England - Telegraph	“Since 2009 things have changed for us and lots of young German players are coming through. We have a good blend, a strong league with three teams who are among the best in Europe with experience in tough competitions but I am not unhappy if some play in a foreign country and see other cultures and other coaches. “Mesut Özil and Sami Khedira do for example and that can be of value and they can learn new things so I think it is valuable if the individual players go abroad.” Only around a third of Premier League players are English while 60 per cent of players in the Bundesliga are German. Löw confirmed that defender Mats Hummels was available after an illness and the Borussia Dortmund centre-back is expected to return with right-back Shkodran Mustafi out injured.The only uncertainty is whether Philipp Lahm plays as right-back or as a holding midfielder. Löw admitted Germany had played “very poorly” in the first half of the 2-1 win over Algeria but that had “proved they could fight”. Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer played a key role against Germany, often operating as a sweeper a long way outside of his area, and Löw said the Bayern Munich stopper is so technically good that he could even play in midfield. He added: “If a team tries to play high the way we did against USA and Algeria the keeper cannot just stay in his box. Manuel Neuer has the same technical skills as the others, he could play in the midfield, he also has great awareness and that’s why we are happy for him to take these risks, and that’s why he’s so valuable. He can basically be a player behind the defence.” Meanwhile, Bayern Munich midfielder Toni Kroos told a news conference that there had been do decision over his future despite reports in Spain that he has agreed to move to Real Madrid. Kroos said: “I want to concentrate on the World Cup and as soon as this tournament is over a decision will be taken – nothing has been decided.” Germany’s leading scorer Thomas Müller believes criticism of the performance against Algeria was exaggerated. “The way things have been interpreted and transmitted is wrong,” he said. “We have won what was a tight game. Even if we had to go through extra-time to get it, we deserved to go through. We weren’t up against a Mickey Mouse team.”	sports

Argentina v Belgium: Eden Hazard must deliver on the biggest stage if he is to stand alongside Lionel Messi - Telegraph	If you were to go back 12-18 months, the likes of Jan Vertonghen, Thomas Vermaelen, Marouane Fellaini, Mousa Dembele, Kevin Mirallas and Romelu Lukaku were all producing performances in the Premier League that made you think that Belgium were on the verge of something really special. Lukaku maintained his form at Everton for the majority of last season, but Hazard and Kompany aside, it has been a while now since the majority of the Belgian players hit the dizzy heights that had us all anticipating great things. As a result, they have struggled to impress in Brazil, but nonetheless they have done well to reach the quarter-finals and secure a meeting with Argentina. But this is where we will find out how good Belgium really are and whether they can live up to expectations by beating a major nation. In reaching the last eight, they have only defeated Algeria, Russia and South Korea. In the second-round tie against the United States, they needed extra time to beat the Americans and almost threw away a 2-0 lead. Argentina will make things much more difficult for Belgium than any of their four World Cup opponents to date, so this is the time when Hazard needs to show the quality he has displayed over the past two years for Chelsea. As Lionel Messi showed by creating the extra-time winner for Ángel di María during Argentina’s laboured second-round victory over Switzerland, great players make the difference when games are tight. Hazard is the only player in the Belgium team capable of producing that moment of magic which can prove the difference between making the semi-finals or going home. He is nowhere near the bracket of greatness which Messi occupies, but he is an exciting player with pace and trickery and impressive strength for a little guy. Hazard has not had a bad World Cup by any means, but he has not produced the moments that many of the other leading creative players have delivered. But if he gets his act together against Argentina, Belgium will have a great chance because Alejandro Sabella’s team are no great shakes. They obviously have Messi and the Barcelona forward has been the difference for them so far in Brazil. Stopping him is incredibly difficult, but the Swiss did as well as any team in terms of denying him time and space during their meeting in Sao Paulo. To frustrate a player such as Messi, you have to make sure that when he gets past the first man, a second one is waiting to take the ball off him. Gokhan Inler and Valon Behrami combined perfectly for the Swiss, until the very last moments when Messi was able to thread the ball through to Di María, but I am not convinced that Fellaini and Axel Witsel possess the same discipline to be able to stifle Messi. Fellaini is the kind of player who is liable to earn an early yellow card and that would be disastrous against a player like Messi. But Belgium do have the potential to come out on top in Brasilia and progress to the semi-finals. For that to happen, all of those players who have to rediscover their best form must deliver and give Hazard the platform to make a difference. It will be more difficult for Belgium to play with the same freedom that saw them create, and miss, so many chances against the Americans, though. Kevin de Bruyne, Divock Origi and Lukaku all caused problems against the States with their pace, but Argentina will be better organised and deny the Belgians the time and space they enjoyed in the second-round victory. Wilmots faces a big decision when deciding whether to stick with Origi as centre-forward or restore Lukaku to the team. Origi has a long way to go before being the finished article. He has genuine pace, but is also raw and displayed some wayward finishing by missing many of his good chances against the Americans. I can see why the likes of Liverpool have been linked with him because he is young and has potential, but you cannot ignore his rawness. Lukaku made a difference after replacing Origi against the States, making one goal and scoring another against a tired defence, but whoever Wilmots selects up front, the key to Belgium’s hopes will be Hazard.

Lukaku maintained his form at Everton for the majority of last season, but Hazard and Kompany aside, it has been a while now since the majority of the Belgian players hit the dizzy heights that had us all anticipating great things. As a result, they have struggled to impress in Brazil, but nonetheless they have done well to reach the quarter-finals and secure a meeting with Argentina. But this is where we will find out how good Belgium really are and whether they can live up to expectations by beating a major nation. In reaching the last eight, they have only defeated Algeria, Russia and South Korea. In the second-round tie against the United States, they needed extra time to beat the Americans and almost threw away a 2-0 lead. Argentina will make things much more difficult for Belgium than any of their four World Cup opponents to date, so this is the time when Hazard needs to show the quality he has displayed over the past two years for Chelsea. As Lionel Messi showed by creating the extra-time winner for Ángel di María during Argentina’s laboured second-round victory over Switzerland, great players make the difference when games are tight. Hazard is the only player in the Belgium team capable of producing that moment of magic which can prove the difference between making the semi-finals or going home. He is nowhere near the bracket of greatness which Messi occupies, but he is an exciting player with pace and trickery and impressive strength for a little guy. Hazard has not had a bad World Cup by any means, but he has not produced the moments that many of the other leading creative players have delivered. But if he gets his act together against Argentina, Belgium will have a great chance because Alejandro Sabella’s team are no great shakes. They obviously have Messi and the Barcelona forward has been the difference for them so far in Brazil. Stopping him is incredibly difficult, but the Swiss did as well as any team in terms of denying him time and space during their meeting in Sao Paulo. To frustrate a player such as Messi, you have to make sure that when he gets past the first man, a second one is waiting to take the ball off him. Gokhan Inler and Valon Behrami combined perfectly for the Swiss, until the very last moments when Messi was able to thread the ball through to Di María, but I am not convinced that Fellaini and Axel Witsel possess the same discipline to be able to stifle Messi. Fellaini is the kind of player who is liable to earn an early yellow card and that would be disastrous against a player like Messi. But Belgium do have the potential to come out on top in Brasilia and progress to the semi-finals. For that to happen, all of those players who have to rediscover their best form must deliver and give Hazard the platform to make a difference. It will be more difficult for Belgium to play with the same freedom that saw them create, and miss, so many chances against the Americans, though. Kevin de Bruyne, Divock Origi and Lukaku all caused problems against the States with their pace, but Argentina will be better organised and deny the Belgians the time and space they enjoyed in the second-round victory. Wilmots faces a big decision when deciding whether to stick with Origi as centre-forward or restore Lukaku to the team. Origi has a long way to go before being the finished article. He has genuine pace, but is also raw and displayed some wayward finishing by missing many of his good chances against the Americans. I can see why the likes of Liverpool have been linked with him because he is young and has potential, but you cannot ignore his rawness. Lukaku made a difference after replacing Origi against the States, making one goal and scoring another against a tired defence, but whoever Wilmots selects up front, the key to Belgium’s hopes will be Hazard. In a World Cup quarter-final, it is about top players taking full advantage of tight situations and Hazard is the only one wearing a Belgium shirt who can do that. - We are more than just Messi, claims Sabella - Sabella brings a bit of Yorkshire to Argentina - Argentina v Belgium: match preview	sports
World Cup 2014: Sheffield United and Leeds United remember Argentina manager Alex Sabella – a man bidding for the World Cup - Telegraph	Adjusting to the training methods at Bramall Lane was said to be a particular issue, with Sabella preferring to reserve energy on the eve of matches rather than over-exert on Friday mornings. Sabella adjusted and was a success at Sheffield United, but when the club were relegated in 1980 a £400,000 move to Elland Road followed. At Leeds there is a recollection of an import by now fully immersed in English football culture. Ex-Elland Road team-mate Paul Hart, who went on to become an esteemed coach and manager in his own right at various clubs, is thrilled at how Sabella’s career has progressed. “He was a very talented midfielder with lots of skill. Everyone took to him straight away,” Hart recalls. “It was a very tough transition for anyone to come from Argentina to England at that time. He’d done well at Sheffield United and what I remember of Alex was him being always very professional. I’m so pleased for him that he is doing so well. “One of the reasons everyone took to him instantly at Leeds because he was a genuinely good guy. "He was no trouble to anyone, took to life in this country and showed a great deal of character to come over here to play his football at a time when – apart from the likes of Ardiles at Spurs – it wasn’t so common.” Clues that Sabella would go on to lead one of the game’s superpowers were not plentiful in those days. “It would be difficult to say any of us thought then we would go on to become managers,” Hart said. “It was not something you thought about as players. I would not have considered going into coaching myself at the time but it is credit to Alex he has made such excellent progress. “I can remember in 1996 going to watch Argentina in a friendly against the Republic of Ireland and Alex was the assistant to the great centre-half Daniel Passarella, who was then in charge of the Argentina team. We had a great chat and he presented me with an Argentina jersey which I still treasure.” Sabella left Leeds after a year, unable to cement a permanent place in the side and eager to return to South America where his coaching credentials became more obvious. If the suggestion he was the alternative to Maradona in Sheffield is more myth than reality, it proved a prophecy in his homeland as he took over the national side following the erratic reigns of Diego and Sergio Batista. “He is a coach who transmits tranquillity to the team,” said former Argentina captain Juan Sebastián Verón. Should Sabella become the first Argentina manager since Carlos Bilardo to win the World Cup, the journey from being Maradona-lite to a footballing legend in his own right will be complete. “He has a great chance and I’ll be hoping Argentina do it because of Alex,” said Hart. The parade of club legends decorating the walls in Sheffield and Leeds may not yet have found space for Sabella. Should he achieve his ambition over the next week, the Bramall Lane and Elland Road Hall of Fame will need refurbishing with the image of a World Cup winner. - Maradona: Argentina cannot rely on Messi - We are more than just Messi, claims Sabella - Alan Hansen: Eden Hazard needs to deliver against Argentina - Argentina v Belgium: match preview	sports

France vs Germany, World Cup 2014: live - Telegraph	Here's Henry Winter's match report. Thanks for reading, please join me for Brazil vs Colombia: live (kickoff 9pm BST) 93 mins: Not that they have especially deserved it, but the French suddenly have a chance. The first signs of nerves in the German defence, and they don't clear properly. Here's Benzema in the inside left channel, hard shot at the keeper but never likely to beat Neuer from this angle... the French chance has gone and that's the lot. 91 mins: Fittingly on the 25th anniversary of Seinfeld first airing, Kramer is coming on for the Germans. Kroos off. 90 mins: Germans doing a good, professional, efficient, etc etc etc job of sewing this up, winning fouls when they need to. 89 mins: We're going to have four minutes of extra time. The French know the matches are only an hour and half long, right? 87 mins: Muller skins Evra and Schurrle has a dream chance to finish this. His shot is blocked by Varane, who bravely/accidentally blocks the ball with his gentleman's area. 86 mins: Germany mounting an over-confident attack as Boateng the centre half charges forward. Easy tiger. 84 mins: Giroud's replaced Valbuena. France, again, seem less... I dunno... bovvered than you would expect from a team six minutes away from going home. 83 mins: Germans have a corner, Neuer is on the halfway line. I would LOVE it if all this sweeper-keeper thing ended up with him getting lobbed from distance. Corner half cleared. 80 mins: Ball into the box, nearly disater for the Germans, Hoewedes has headed it at the back of Hummels. Would have been a comedy OG. In fact, it's a corner. The Germans break fast and true, and they're looking at 2-0 here... several men forward, crossed across for Schurrle who has all the time in the world. Ah, he's hit it straight at the keeper. 79 mins: Germany solid, not really attacked much of late, but here's Lahm. He loses it and Schweinsteiger feels obliged to trip up the breaking French midfielder, Griezmann I think. 76 mins: Cheryl Matuidi draws a reasonable save out of Neuer, but realistically he was never going to beat him from the angle. 75 mins: Shame, unlucky France. It's crossed over the box from the right, Benzema plucks it out the air and does pretty well to get a shot away. But he had not, and could not have, seen Balbuena on his left, arriving late in the area and in an even better position. 74 mins: Muller and Ozil cut France open, but the French defence are well back. 72 mins: Valbuena shows great control to pick it up on the inside left but his shot is lacking. 71 mins: Remy on for Cabaye. The French seem a bit.... unruffled. Not been a great urgency about their play. 70 mins: France have runners but Griezmann goes for a silly shot. 69 mins: Koscielny in for Sakho. 68 mins: This exchange. Sake. Jonathan Pearce: "There was an interesting documentary the other night about false nines, have you seen any tactical innovations at this World Cup?" Mark Lawrenson: "No." 66 mins: Klose has run his race, Schurrle comes on. Greg Bee writes: On the subject of J-Lo's shirts (no, not her), surely the obvious candidate as the new Germany manager is Pep-Guard, given that he dressed like Milk Tray Man during the Champs League last season? Azet agrees: "I always love Lowe's fashion style from the beginning. Elegent as always!" 65 mins: There's a lot of jeering in the stadium, Jonathan Pearce reckons it is in protest against goal-line technology Brazil fans unhappy that the game has got a bit cagey. 62 mins: Classy veterans match down this side as Evra crosses but Lahm makes the clearance. Benzema wrongly blown up for hands from the corner. 61 mins: Shades of Toni as Schweinsteiger leaps shoulder first into Valbeuna. Looked worse than it was, I think. 59 mins: Here's Matuidi on the break after a poor header from Boateng. Schewini hacks it out for a corner. Ball's eventually back in but Varane's header is never going to trouble Neuer. 55 mins: Griezmann sends Valbuena through but the ball's overhit. Kroos goes for am ambitious long range effort. P Kovak: Germany will beat france but holland will win the cup Kiran Kulkarni says: I feel Loic Remy could turn out to be a trump card with his pace & dynamism..Deschamps shouldn't wait till 80th minute to bring him on.. Giroud can be given a night off as he is too static & will not make things happen on his own. Alan White writes: Watching on a tiny tv on a French campsite so rooting for France. Germany started 2nd half rather too well. Allez les Bleus!!! 53 mins: Griezmann breaks, it's opening up for the French here, but Khedira knows what he has to do: he drags him to the ground and accepts the yellow card without a murmur. 51 mins: Really good ball forward but Griezmann's control lets him down. 49 mins: A nothing freekick, Valbuena lifts it in quickly, Evra nearly gets on it. Miles offside but the linesman does not flag. Half the ground is in shadow, half in blinding sunlight - maybe he cannot see? 47 mins: Schweinsteiger with a nice judo move on Griezmann, getting his foot behind the Frenchman's calf and using his opponent's own bodyweight to haul him down. I am scoring it an Ippon. Surprisingly, given that this happened in the penalty area, the French don't claim for a foul. 46 mins: France will kick us off. No changes as far as I can see. Good bit of pundity by Rio at half time about Varane got bullied by the German goalscorer, should have been more aggressive and not let Hummels "put his hands on him", which sounded vaguely indecent. Neat start from France. HALF TIME: FRANCE 0 GERMANY 1 Good match, German composure and passing probably just shading it over some nice French movement, but there are spaces behind the German high back line and France, notably through Valbuena, have been able to get in behind a couple of them. Gary Lineker gets off a good one, saying “The German manager was not afraid to leave out a big player – Ruud, have you any experience of that in your own managerial career?” Alan Shearer enjoys the joke. Let's grab a few emails, Craig Sobering, why don't you kick us off? Tough one for me today as these are two of my favorite teams after Holland. Was a bit concerned to hear that much of the German team is suffering from the flu - that will make things tougher in the heat and humidity down there. Considering that and some of the weaker performances from the Germans later in the tournament I think the French are more likely to advance. Hoping for an exciting match whichever way the cards fall. And Soren writes: So far the match plan went just as expected. France attack - when it comes - is really fast, but the German defenders are mostly there. And a header for the lead. No complete fail, as Götze was against Algeria. One half to go for the fourth semifinal in a row - that'd be an academy record! 44 mins: Only going to be a minute of added time. 42 mins: Benzema with a twisty-tosty run after a ball from the highly exciting Pogba, but the shot doesn't measure up. 40 mins: France! That looked a decent shout for a handball. Cheryl Matuidi with the ball from the left, Benzema connects with a header, it hits Hummels in the breadbasket. Yeah no handball actually. 38 mins: Pogba's skinned Schweinsteiger! I think we can all enjoy that. 37 mins: Game slows down, indeed stops, and some players have decided they want a drink. 35 mins: Khedira and Kroos nearly smuggle the ball through a well-packed French line. Muller bursting through. Lawro is in especially miserable form this afternoon, by the way. He's furious that Sami Khedira has been hit in the face by the ball. "Ooh what a shock, man playing football hit in face by football," carps the Preston Pouter. 33 mins: Super save from Neuer, one hander to deny Valbuena from a tight angle, Benzema nearly spoons the follow up over the keeper but there are too many Germans in attendance. A couple of decent corners from France ensue. 32 mins: Germans getting full use of the lovely Maracana grass, Muller the latest to have a little lie down in the French penalty area. And why not? Debuchy was within three feet of him, or even closer. 29 mins: A ball into the France box, Howaaaaaydes has a go at it and the ref seems to be the only one in the stadium who reckons that this is a corner. But a corner it is. No alarm for France. 25 mins: Khedira sends Muller through and Lloris charges out to deny him. 23 mins: Klose is into the box! Debuchy goes with him and might well be grabbing his shirt. If Klose hadn't dived QUITE so theatrically the ref might have given him a pen there. Ridiculous dive. Klose prepares for take-off 22 mins: France build down the right, but Hummels and his defensive colleagues are well aware of the threat Griezmann poses and he is well marshalled. 20 mins: Neat play by the French but not quite with the pace or verve to rattle the Germans at the moment. 15 mins: That goal for Germany has been sandwiched by some really attractive attacking play by France, Valbuena to the fore. GOAL! A good spell of play from the French is rudely curtailed when the Germans win a freekick on the left, thanks to a foolish foul from Pogba. Ball in... Hummels gets the better of Varane at the back post and powers home the header. Excellent delivery from Toni Kroos. France 0 Germany 1 (Hummels 13) 10 mins: Valbuena’s now popped upon the right and Germany clear, just about. Now Antonie Griezmann's turn to make a fine run and his cross is only barely cut out by Hummels 8 mins: Klose and Khedira link up quite well but the ball rolls through to Lloris. He sensibly slows the game down... And out of the bleu France produce a neat bit of play, the busy Valbuena gets in behind the left back Hoewedes I DON'T WANNA HAVE TO DO THE I TOLD YOU SO DANCE BUT I DID SAY THAT MIGHT HAPPEN, JOACHIM and he crosses for Benzema, who probably should have done better 6 mins: France look off the pace, Evra's chopped down Muller. 4 mins: French should ask the ref if he's got a spare ball, Germany won't them have a go with this one. 2 mins: Germany with much of the ball, France hanging back, they've strung five across midfield. Sakho dithers and Muller makes a good run and cross, it's hoofed clear. 1 mins: Germany lose it cheaply but their high-pressing line harries the French before anything can come of it. Lahm indeed at right back. 17.02 Germany will kick off. 17.01 Quite a bit of anti-racism. Now we've got a big banner. Jonathan Pearce worries that the players are having to stand out there in the heat. 30 degrees. Perhaps technophobe Pearce is upset about the newfangled banner. 16.59 Stirring performance of two top-notch anthems. Here are the France team: 16.55 The captains of France and Germany now each read out a statement about how they're all anti-racism, it's to do with a FIFA Anti-Discrimination day. 16.53 All Europeans now, as Basil Fawlty so wisely put it. These English folks are supporting Germany. 16.48 Oh was it Theirry? I missed the start. Baudelaire's 'Elevation', according to a man on the internets. Next up: Alan Shearer reads the works of Sylvia Plath. 16.45 Goodness gracious it's all gone very French over on BBC. Some moody ambient music, a man reciting a poem in Foreign. I expect someone will have a love triangle or fall off their bike or stab themselves in the eye any moment now. 16.42 Funnily enough, you would fancy Neuer for a massive foul coming out the box, wouldn't you? Not necessarily a violent or vicious one, but all that charging out and trying to tackle. And funnily enough, just as I type this, they're talking about it on the telly. "It's high risk football, if it doens't come off it's a red card," says Rio Ferdinand. 16.40 A film, and a discussion about the Toni Schumacher and that foul of fouls. CAn you imagine the internet drama if it happened now? 16.38 These people are showing off their colours. For any readers who don't speak French, the message on their t-shirts reads 'France', which is French for France. 16.30 It's Rio! Yay! And Alan Shearer. Ok. And Shexy Ruud Gullitsh! Great. 16.29 There's a little preview thing in a theatre. Hey if Germany win, they will reach a record fourth consecutive semi final. 16.28 I always get a little frisson during the World Cup while the titles of the TV shows are playing. Who will be on pundit detail? 16.25 Anyway, that's enough tennising. Here comes football. 16.20 "Email that has made me the most jealous" award goes to Richard Piercy, who says: Holidaying in Vegas to celebrate my girlfriends 40th and glued to your match coverage from beside the pool. Going to see Cirque de Soleil later wonder which will have more diving and acrobatics? Oh man, that sounds like a lot of fun. Hope you both have a great time. Remember to drink and gamble irresponsibly. 16.15 First email of the day honour goes to Søren H. Assmann Stuck at work. Won't join the game till at least 15 minutes in. That being said, the lineup gives France credit. The German lineup. Taking out his slowest defender, Mertesacker, moving the fastest, Boateng into the middle, knowing that France scored all of their goals from inside the box this World Cup, shows Löw is actually adjusting to meet France's attack. Don't underestimate Höwedes. He isn't the fastest, but near unbeatable in a direct 1:1, he's there to prevent the pass to the outside and flanks into the box. Which is the exact tactic Germany will use up front - bringing Klose up front instead of the small Götze is putting up a serious header challenge to the France defense, plus another prime assist-giver. If Boateng and Hummels harmonize, and Schweinsteiger and Khedira become the prime couple they were in the last tournament, France will have one hell of a day to get their attack machine going. 16.08 One of the features of Germany's match with Algeria was the goalkeeping of Manuel Neuer, hurtling out of his goal like a big aul mad one. Paul Hayward has the skinny: The tournament's outstanding keeper possesses all the talents of an outfield player and has been likened to the great Franz Beckenbauer A German goalie charging off his line to engage a French attacker is not a happy image after Harald Schumacher’s levelling of Patrick Battiston in 1982. If Manuel Neuer surges out of his goal at the Maracana, the effect will be more Beckenbauer than bulldozer. Joachim Löw, the Germany coach, thinks Neuer could “play in midfield” and Toni Kroos, who fills one of those positions, calls him the team’s “11th outfield player.” In a tournament of “high” German pressure, Bayern Munich’s keeper is reinventing the last line of defence. “This is the class of Manuel Neuer. He can basically play as a player behind the defenders,” Löw said in Rio. “He can basically pass like an outfield player.” Read more of that here, most interesting stuff. 16.02 Talking, as we were a few minutes ago, of betting, Betfair are paying all money back as a free bet, on selected markets, if any of today's quarter finals games go to extra time. See more about that here. You'd have to fancy this France-Germany to go to 120 minutes, surely? 16.00 Here are the brave men and true who will be lining up shortly. 15.57 I'm considerably more interested in the football. Talking of telly, a nice modest tweet from the nice and modest Richard Keys. 15.55 A tennis is happening on BBC TV at the moment, Dimitrov and Djokovic going at it, Rob Bagchi is the man blogging for us. 15.53 Chelsea's Schurrle is a bit unlucky to be on the bench, I reckon. And Arsenal's Ozil can probably count himself on the fortunate side. 15.52 Here are the full teams France: 1-Hugo Lloris; 2-Mathieu Debuchy, 4-Raphael Varane, 5-Mamadou Sakho, 3-Patrice Evra; 6-Yohan Cabaye; 8-Mathieu Valbuena, 14-Blaise Matuidi, 19-Paul Pogba; 10-Karim Benzema, 11-Antoine Griezmann Substitutes: 7-Remy Cabella, 9-Olivier Giroud, 12-Rio Mavuba, 13-Eliaquim Mangala, 15-Bacary Sagna, 16-Stephane Ruffier, 17-Lucas Digne, 18-Moussa Sissoko, 20-Loic Remy, 21-Laurent Koscielny, 22-Morgan Schneiderlin, 23-Mickael Landreau Germany: 1-Manuel Neuer; 20-Jerome Boateng, 5-Mats Hummels, 4-Benedikt Hoewedes; 6-Sami Khedira, 7-Bastian Schweinsteiger, 16-Philipp Lahm, 18-Toni Kroos, 8-Mesut Ozil; 13-Thomas Mueller, 11-Miroslav Klose Substitutes: 2-Kevin Grosskreutz, 3-Matthias Ginter, 9-Andre Schuerrle, 10-Lukas Podolski, 12-Ron-Robert Zieler, 14-Julian Draxler, 15-Erik Durm, 17-Per Mertesacker, 19-Mario Goetze, 21-Shkodran Mustafi, 22-Roman Weidenfeller, 23-Chrisoph Kramer 15.50 Well, assuming that's true, it makes sense. Always seemed odd, to these untutored eyes at least, why he was playing one of the world's best fullbacks in centre midfield, and having two centre-halves playing in the full-back positions. 15.45 Wow, a bit of a curve ball from Loew by the sounds of it... 15.40 Reading Alan Smith's assessement seems to me to bear out what the bookies are saying: Germany around 15/8, France a best-priced 19/10, and the draw in 90 minutes 21/10. in other words, it's ascloseasthis. 15.35 A really excellent preview piece here from Alan Smith (the Arsenal one!) in which he runs the rule over the expected starting XIs. France vs Germany: The players rated head-to-head 15.30 A video for your enjoyment. Joachim Löw is confident despite the illness that has been troubling some of his squad. 15.25 Aside from the Central and Southern American teams, France have been one of the most enjoyable surprises of the tournament so far. So pacy! So lethal in front of goal! So not trying to stab the coach in the back and going on strike! Truly, these are les bonnes temps, for our French friends. 15.20 Afternoon all. Alan Tyers here. Welcome to our live blog of the first quarter final. Two proper big boys of European football, two properly exciting football teams. Hard to see any obvious weaknesses: perhaps the German full-back Howedes, a converted centre-half could be vulnerable to a Frenchman running in behind. The talented Mathieu Debuchy can be positionally supect. But, really, you're nit-picking. Two classy outfits. France vs Germany Estadio Maracana, Rio de Janeiro Kick-off: 17.00 BST TV: BBC ONE Team news France (Possible, 4-2-1-3): Lloris; Debuchy, Varane, Sakho, Evra; Matuidi, Cabaye; Pogba; Valbuena, Benzema, Griezman. Germany (Possible, 4-3-3): Neuer; Hummels, Boateng, Mertesacker, Howedes; Schweinsteiger, Lahm, Kroos; Özil, Müller, Götze. Referee: Nestor Pitana (Argentina). Under-fire Germany face rejuvenated France in Friday's World Cup quarter-final at Rio de Janeiro's iconic Maracana stadium in a clash of two European powerhouses. This represents an acid test for Germany coach Joachim Loew after eight years in charge with his side heavily criticised at home for below-par performances at Brazil 2014. A place in Tuesday's semi-final against either Brazil or Colombia in Belo Horizonte is at stake. "Didier Deschamps has turned France around since 2010 and we're looking forward to another classic," said Loew who took charge after the 2006 World Cup. The German camp has been blighted by illness in the build-up with Loew revealing seven of his squad have suffered with light 'flu symptoms and sore throats. The full squad trained at the Maracana on Thursday and Loew is relishing the "magic" of the knock-out stages, but says a good result takes precedence over a good performance. Their 4-0 hammering of Portugal in their opening group match confirmed their status amongst the world's elite. But having been held to a 2-2 draw by Ghana, then grinding out a 1-0 win over the USA in their final group match, poor finishing saw Germany labour to a 2-1 extra-time win over Algeria in Monday's last 16 clash. Former captains Michael Ballack, Oliver Kahn and Lothar Matthaeus have all questioned Loew's selections with playmaker Mesut Ozil struggling and centre-backs Jerome Boateng and Benedikt Hoewedes being played out of position as wing-backs. Loew has a contract with the German FA (DFB) until June 2016, but a quarter-final exit will put him under pressure to resign despite steering his side to the semi-finals of the last three major tournaments. The Germany boss says his side's best football at Brazil 2014 is still to come. "We have not yet delivered our best possible performances, that is to come still," Loew told a press conference here Thursday. "This isn't some easy-to-figure out computer game and your own team isn't always easy to programme, but you have to find the right combinations. "You either win and stay or lose and go home." In contrast, France have risen steadily under their coach Deschamps and are unrecognisable from their chaotic 2010 campaign in South Africa. With Karim Benzema in top form, France are dreaming of their first World Cup title since their 1998 triumph on home soil, but their focus is solely on Germany. "There is no apprehension or fear. There is no reason for us to feel any," said Deschamps. "Germany are a solid side with lots of experience of this level but this game will be a pleasure for us and we are preparing ourselves as well as possible for it." Honours are even in terms of recent meetings with France claiming a 2-1 win in Bremen in February 2012, while Germany claimed revenge by the exact same scoreline in Paris 12 months later. The French lead the series with 11 wins to Germany's eight in 25 previous meetings. Both sides played down the relevance of their legendary 1982 World Cup semi-final, which Germany won 5-4 on penalties after a dramatic 3-3 extra-time draw. The Seville game attained notoriety when Germany keeper Harald Schumacher shoulder-charged Patrick Battiston, leaving the Frenchman unconscious on the ground. With the media quick to ask whether France can claim some World Cup revenge, both Loew and Deschamps pointed to the fact most of their respective players were not born at the time. Germany should have centre-back Mats Hummels back after missing the Algeria win with flu, while Lukas Podolski is fit again after a thigh strain. There is a question mark over France defender Raphael Varane, who spent the night in hospital with dehydration after Monday's 2-0 win over Nigeria in the last 16. Liverpool defender Mamadou Sakho is fit again after knee problems, while it remains to be seen who Deschamps names as striker between Olivier Giroud or Antoine Griezmann.

Fabrice Muamba seizes his chance after extraordinary journey from political refugee to Premier League - Telegraph	“It’s Africa, isn’t it? That’s the type of continent it is. There is always dramas, wars and stuff. My father was an adviser for the prime minister. Dad was involved in the political situation but had to move away, to come to England.’’ As the rebels moved into Kinshasa, Marcel Muamba had to move quickly, telling the nine-year-old Fabrice that he was just going out. Three years elapsed before they were reunited. “When he moved, he had to help me and mum get to England. If I had stayed, they would have seen us as an easy target to get information from the regime people, to use it against us. My mum, dad and siblings all live in London now.” Muamba has never been back to the land of his birth. Although tensions have eased, he remains suspicious of the reception. So he admitted to being surprised when the DR Congo FA contacted him at Bolton last year, inviting him to represent the country. He sensed a trap. “I just thought it best not to get involved. Because of how my family situation is back home, it is quite difficult for me to go back. They would see me as an easy target, to get rid of me. I have got family but they have had to change their identity in order to be safe. “I can go back but secretly. I’m going in the summer out of curiosity, to see what I might be able to give back. I will have to go back via another country and in that way. Dad won’t go back at all.” What a journey. Muamba will reflect “on how far I have come” when God Save the Queen pipes up on Sunday. “England is my adopted country. People have helped me, welcomed me with open arms and given me this opportunity. I’m earning a more than decent living and leading a comfortable life. I’m very appreciative. “When I look back on the journey, I see how lucky I am. I’m not the most talented footballer but I know what I can do and what I need to do to stay where I am. I just keep myself to myself and enjoy what I have and hopefully move on to better things. "I want to enjoy all life can give to me. What I have experienced is what keeps me going and gets me out of whatever difficulty I face.” Relentless appliance defines him on and off the field. A native Lingala and French speaker, Muamba worked hard to become fluent in English. Determined to maintain his education, he will start an Open University course in accountancy in September. His footballing journey began at Arsenal under Arsène Wenger and now accelerates under Owen Coyle at Bolton. “Owen gets involved and plays with us in training. Arsène doesn’t get involved like that. Owen is more a people’s person. Arsène is just Arsène, very strategic. You have to sit down and talk to him to understand the kind of man he is.” Well trained by Wenger, Steve Bruce at Birmingham City and Coyle, Muamba knows that his footballing journey could run into a substantial roadblock in Herning. “Spain have a very good team, similar to the senior: pass, pass, pass. We have to hit them on the counter. The boys feel fresh and ready to go.” He understood why Wenger stopped Jack Wilshere from attending the Euros for fear of exhaustion. “I met him at Bolton and he was good. He has progressed to be very good. Jack has been awesome this year. He’s not here but we have a bunch of boys chomping at the bit.’’ Some, like Muamba, remember their last under-21 journey in Scandinavia, reaching the Malmo final against the Germans of Mesut Ozil, Sami Khedira and Manuel Neuer. “Before the game we had loads of messages in the dressing room from David Beckham, Steven Gerrard, all the senior boys. Then to come in after being beaten 4-0 ... that changing room was not the best place to be.” Muamba has been in far worse places. He’s been in harm’s way. “It’s been a long journey. To sit here and speak English like this – I’m quite impressed with myself!” Some journey, some man.	sports

Owen is more a people’s person. Arsène is just Arsène, very strategic. You have to sit down and talk to him to understand the kind of man he is.” Well trained by Wenger, Steve Bruce at Birmingham City and Coyle, Muamba knows that his footballing journey could run into a substantial roadblock in Herning. “Spain have a very good team, similar to the senior: pass, pass, pass. We have to hit them on the counter. The boys feel fresh and ready to go.” He understood why Wenger stopped Jack Wilshere from attending the Euros for fear of exhaustion. “I met him at Bolton and he was good. He has progressed to be very good. Jack has been awesome this year. He’s not here but we have a bunch of boys chomping at the bit.’’ Some, like Muamba, remember their last under-21 journey in Scandinavia, reaching the Malmo final against the Germans of Mesut Ozil, Sami Khedira and Manuel Neuer. “Before the game we had loads of messages in the dressing room from David Beckham, Steven Gerrard, all the senior boys. Then to come in after being beaten 4-0 ... that changing room was not the best place to be.” Muamba has been in far worse places. He’s been in harm’s way. “It’s been a long journey. To sit here and speak English like this – I’m quite impressed with myself!” Some journey, some man.	sports

Festivals with children – a handy survival guide - Telegraph	Find one for the whole family: a rocking weekend in Reading may be your nirvana, but it won’t impress your two-year-old. Luckily, child-friendly festivals are springing up all over the country. Shambala in Northamptonshire and Camp Bestival in Dorset have won plaudits in recent years but, if possible, find an event close to home – no one enjoys a long car journey with bored children in the back. Go in a group A fun option is to invite your children’s friends and their parents to join you. The children will have someone to play with, while the adults can take it in turns to have some grown-up time and enjoy a band without distractions. Be organised Once you’ve chosen your festival, and worked out the journey, make a plan for the weekend. Schedule in “must-see” events so you don’t miss them and check what facilities are available on site. For instance, will you need to walk long distances? Are there showers and flushing toilets? Is there a shop for buying emergency essentials? Pack carefully Good camping equipment is vital: warm, dry and comfortable campers will be happy ones – and that means happy, relaxed children. So pack waterproofs as well as summer shorts. And if your child can’t sleep without a favourite toy or blanket, then remember to bring that too. Fun, fun, fun If you’ve planned ahead, you’re already halfway there, but don’t forget to have fun! Leave some space in the car for a bag of dressing-up clothes and keep children occupied with face paints, transfers, bubble wands and sticker books. Then all you need to do is hope and pray for good weather!	sports

Six surprising facts about Volvo - Telegraph	Volvo is a Latin word, meaning “I roll” The Volvo name was established 100 years ago, when the company was founded by Assar Gabrielsson and Gustaf Larson. It was originally for the ball bearing production part of the business at that time. The first Volvo car went into mass production in 1927 and was designed to offer safety and quality – a commitment that remains at the heart of the brand to this day. Volvo takes innovation seriously Think of a feature that is now taken for granted on the modern automobile and the chances are that Volvo had a hand in developing it. The three-point seat belt was invented by Volvo engineer Nils Bohlin in 1959, though Volvo didn’t patent it as it believes that safety is for everyone. The company also pioneered the Lambda Sensor catalytic converter in 1976, underscoring its environmental credentials. It introduced the Side Impact Protection System (SIPS) in the 1990s and has since launched a number of collision-prevention devices, such as City Safety, which monitors other road users and brings the car to a halt if an impact looks likely. For Volvo, comfort is a priority As well as safety, Volvo is renowned for the comfort of its vehicles. It’s all part of the company’s “cool outside, warm inside” design philosophy, which ensures the clean exterior lines of its cars are complemented by luxurious interiors, in which it is a pleasure to spend time. Volvo even worked with orthopaedic surgeons in the 1960s on its seat design. Just ask the people of Kilcullen, in Ireland, whose Town Hall Theatre is fitted out with seats from the S80 luxury saloon. This is thanks to the efforts of local Volvo dealer Pat Dunlea, who saw the seats being used in a theatre at the S80’s launch in Gothenburg, and asked the company to donate them to his local theatre after the event. Volvo readily agreed – ensuring Kilcullen’s residents enjoy their drama from a uniquely comfy vantage point. Volvo makes the earth move – literally To be certain of the strength of its vehicles, Volvo has a highly unusual piece of machinery in its Gothenburg test lab. Originally intended to assess how buildings withstand earthquakes, Volvo has modified it to crash test cars. The company carries out 450 full-scale tests per year, taking up to 10 days to prepare for a full test. Cameras then record 1,000 frames per second and the crash test barrier weighs 800 tonnes. That’s how the company secures its reputation for building the world’s safest vehicles, inspiring confidence among motorists across the globe. Volvo is committed to driver safety Such is Volvo’s commitment to road safety, it has its own Accident Research Team. These specialists have analysed more than 40,000 accidents since 1970, either by visiting their aftermath in person or recreating them in Volvo's test lab. “In consequence,” explains Volvo’s head of business sales, Selwyn Cooper, “we have developed a deep understanding of what actually happens in accidents, and draw on this in designing ever-greater safety systems. This all works towards our target that by 2020, no one will be killed or seriously injured while travelling in one of our new cars.” Also, the Volvo V40 has been awarded the highest score ever by EuroNCAP, making it the safest car produced. Volvos go the distance The highest recorded mileage on a Volvo is three million, which has been clocked up by American Irv Gordon in the P1800 he’s owned since he bought it new in 1966. That’s a lot more than the figure needed to join Volvo’s high mileage club: 150,000 miles gets you bronze membership, 300,000 secures silver, and 500,000 makes you a gold member. In each case, a special badge can be ordered to share your vehicle’s achievement with the world. And of course, the existence of such a club tells you everything you need to know about the durability of Volvo’s vehicles. • By building safe, economical and comfortable cars, Volvo is a natural partner for business users who want to minimise costs and ensure their fleet is in the best possible order at all times.

"It is also important to remember recovery: your body needs the right combination of protein and carbs to help your muscles recover, especially after hitting the hills.” Her target time? “I’m hoping to ideally finish in about six-and-a-half hours, but I think the most important thing is to enjoy the ride and cross the finish line whenever you can.” Get involved Last year the inaugural Prudential RideLondon was such a success that this summer’s event, on August 9-10, 2014, is expected to be even bigger.

Christmas truce 1914 | The First World War centenary - Telegraph	The Christmas Truce of 1914 remains one of the most symbolic events of the Great War “Plugstreet” was far from the only football match played along the silent Western Front on that extraordinary Christmas Eve but it is one that caught the world’s imagination – partly thanks to its position at the epicentre of the fighting, and partly due to the multiple surviving written accounts. The official history of Germany’s 133rd Saxon Regiment describes “caps casually laid down as goals” and Teutonic astonishment that Scottish players were wearing nothing under their kilts. The game ended with a narrow 3-2 German victory, after the football struck a piece of barbed wire. But even that did little to deflate the festive spirit, fuelled by the exchange of British bully beef and rum for German sausages and cognac. Belt buckles, badges and buttons followed suit, along with prolific high-jinks. A German barber gave short-back-and-sides to British “customers” in a crater, while one of his comrades strutted about in a blouse, skirt and top hat taken from an abandoned Belgian home nearby. One British officer wrote to his wife that a further truce had been fixed for New Year’s Day as “the Germans want to see how the photos come out”. Sadly the next ceasefire didn’t materialise until November 1918 – but to many that simply added to the allure of the first. Contemporary commentators were near-unanimous in praising the mutinous actions of the troops, with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle describing it as “one human episode amid the atrocities which have stained the memory of war”. The exceptional events of that day are well documented at Ploegsteert’s 14-18 Experience Interpretation Centre, as is the story of the area’s famous “tunnellers”: specialists who dug deep under enemy lines for months or years at a time in order to destroy them from below. Indeed the “Plugstreet Tunnellers” were credited with a key role in the destruction of nearby Messines Ridge – a major German stronghold since the start of the war. When the enormous pile of explosives they planted was finally detonated under German lines in 1917, it was the biggest series of explosions in history. The bang was heard as far away as 10 Downing Street. The truce began when German soldiers decorated the tops of their trenches with candles and Christmas trees The museum itself, built beneath a great glass pyramid in Ploegsteert Wood, opened in November 2013. Focusing on the experiences of local civilians as well as soldiers from both sides, its semi-underground construction evokes life in the trenches 100 years ago through interactive exhibits. Original, never-before-seen documents are presented in four languages beneath a colossal LED screen detailing the battle. Ploegsteert’s new memorial centre is just one of a number of must-see First World War sites here, at what was once the heart of the infamous Ypres Salient. Within a two-mile radius are no less than 14 Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries, 35 surviving concrete bunkers and command posts, and the ruins of Château Breuvart, which was destroyed during the fighting. A century on, the Christmas Truce of 1914 remains one of the most symbolic events of the Great War: a bright spark of humanity within the darkest conflict of mankind’s history. Afterwards, others such as Edith Cavell and Gabrielle Petit fought to keep that flame alight in occupied Belgium. With centennial events planned to mark the outbreak of the war and a remarkable 20-minute film, The First and the Last, explaining how and why it happened (which you can see at belgiumtheplaceto.be and at youtube.com/watch?v=str6HIaY0-g#t=188), now is the perfect time to celebrate the peace they earned for us. Go to belgiumtheplaceto.be or call 020 7531 0390 for more information A famous face on Plugstreet In December 1915, a young British officer was posted to Plugstreet to take control of the 6th Royal Scots Fusiliers. His name: Lt Col Winston Churchill. Formerly the First Lord of the Admiralty, Churchill, then 41, had departed the British Government following his key role in the disastrous Gallipoli campaign. In his resignation letter, he requested a return to his former calling as a soldier. “I am an officer and I place myself unreservedly at the disposal of the military authorities,” wrote Churchill, “observing that my regiment is in France.” Instead, the future Prime Minister found himself amid the bloody carnage of Wallonia. During five months on the front line, he made a huge impression, primarily due to what one historian describes as his “incessant craving for action”. His idiosyncrasies and unparalleled bravery inspired a fierce loyalty among his own men Known for his near-preposterous fearlessness, Churchill didn’t feel the regiment’s Glengarry bonnet particularly suited him, so instead adopted a French army helmet in the trenches. He would often spend nights crawling on his stomach across No Man’s Land, settling in a hole near the German defences and eavesdropping on their plans. On other evenings, he would liven things up with his own private offensives against the enemy. He would command his men to put out bursts of machine gun fire in the early hours until the shocked Germans, convinced an offensive was commencing, returned fire. Churchill then used this as an excuse to telephone the artillery demanding immediate support – and the heavy shelling of the trenches opposite him. Soon this would escalate into a general flare-up of activity along the entire sector, making him as unpopular with the neighbouring battalions as he was with the enemy. But his idiosyncrasies and unparalleled bravery also inspired a fierce loyalty among his own men. When the 6th and 7th Battalions merged in 1916, Churchill left Plugstreet to return to politics, leaving a disproportionately large amount of stories and disappointed soldiers behind him in Wallonia.

Christmas truce 1914 | The First World War centenary - Telegraph	The Christmas Truce of 1914 remains one of the most symbolic events of the Great War “Plugstreet” was far from the only football match played along the silent Western Front on that extraordinary Christmas Eve but it is one that caught the world’s imagination – partly thanks to its position at the epicentre of the fighting, and partly due to the multiple surviving written accounts. The official history of Germany’s 133rd Saxon Regiment describes “caps casually laid down as goals” and Teutonic astonishment that Scottish players were wearing nothing under their kilts. The game ended with a narrow 3-2 German victory, after the football struck a piece of barbed wire. But even that did little to deflate the festive spirit, fuelled by the exchange of British bully beef and rum for German sausages and cognac. Belt buckles, badges and buttons followed suit, along with prolific high-jinks. A German barber gave short-back-and-sides to British “customers” in a crater, while one of his comrades strutted about in a blouse, skirt and top hat taken from an abandoned Belgian home nearby. One British officer wrote to his wife that a further truce had been fixed for New Year’s Day as “the Germans want to see how the photos come out”. Sadly the next ceasefire didn’t materialise until November 1918 – but to many that simply added to the allure of the first. Contemporary commentators were near-unanimous in praising the mutinous actions of the troops, with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle describing it as “one human episode amid the atrocities which have stained the memory of war”. The exceptional events of that day are well documented at Ploegsteert’s 14-18 Experience Interpretation Centre, as is the story of the area’s famous “tunnellers”: specialists who dug deep under enemy lines for months or years at a time in order to destroy them from below. Indeed the “Plugstreet Tunnellers” were credited with a key role in the destruction of nearby Messines Ridge – a major German stronghold since the start of the war. When the enormous pile of explosives they planted was finally detonated under German lines in 1917, it was the biggest series of explosions in history. The bang was heard as far away as 10 Downing Street. The truce began when German soldiers decorated the tops of their trenches with candles and Christmas trees The museum itself, built beneath a great glass pyramid in Ploegsteert Wood, opened in November 2013. Focusing on the experiences of local civilians as well as soldiers from both sides, its semi-underground construction evokes life in the trenches 100 years ago through interactive exhibits. Original, never-before-seen documents are presented in four languages beneath a colossal LED screen detailing the battle. Ploegsteert’s new memorial centre is just one of a number of must-see First World War sites here, at what was once the heart of the infamous Ypres Salient. Within a two-mile radius are no less than 14 Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries, 35 surviving concrete bunkers and command posts, and the ruins of Château Breuvart, which was destroyed during the fighting. A century on, the Christmas Truce of 1914 remains one of the most symbolic events of the Great War: a bright spark of humanity within the darkest conflict of mankind’s history. Afterwards, others such as Edith Cavell and Gabrielle Petit fought to keep that flame alight in occupied Belgium. With centennial events planned to mark the outbreak of the war and a remarkable 20-minute film, The First and the Last, explaining how and why it happened (which you can see at belgiumtheplaceto.be and at youtube.com/watch?v=str6HIaY0-g#t=188), now is the perfect time to celebrate the peace they earned for us. Go to belgiumtheplaceto.be or call 020 7531 0390 for more information A famous face on Plugstreet In December 1915, a young British officer was posted to Plugstreet to take control of the 6th Royal Scots Fusiliers. His name: Lt Col Winston Churchill. Formerly the First Lord of the Admiralty, Churchill, then 41, had departed the British Government following his key role in the disastrous Gallipoli campaign. In his resignation letter, he requested a return to his former calling as a soldier. “I am an officer and I place myself unreservedly at the disposal of the military authorities,” wrote Churchill, “observing that my regiment is in France.” Instead, the future Prime Minister found himself amid the bloody carnage of Wallonia. During five months on the front line, he made a huge impression, primarily due to what one historian describes as his “incessant craving for action”. His idiosyncrasies and unparalleled bravery inspired a fierce loyalty among his own men Known for his near-preposterous fearlessness, Churchill didn’t feel the regiment’s Glengarry bonnet particularly suited him, so instead adopted a French army helmet in the trenches. He would often spend nights crawling on his stomach across No Man’s Land, settling in a hole near the German defences and eavesdropping on their plans. On other evenings, he would liven things up with his own private offensives against the enemy. He would command his men to put out bursts of machine gun fire in the early hours until the shocked Germans, convinced an offensive was commencing, returned fire. Churchill then used this as an excuse to telephone the artillery demanding immediate support – and the heavy shelling of the trenches opposite him. Soon this would escalate into a general flare-up of activity along the entire sector, making him as unpopular with the neighbouring battalions as he was with the enemy. But his idiosyncrasies and unparalleled bravery also inspired a fierce loyalty among his own men. When the 6th and 7th Battalions merged in 1916, Churchill left Plugstreet to return to politics, leaving a disproportionately large amount of stories and disappointed soldiers behind him in Wallonia.

World Cup 2014 team-by-team guide - Telegraph	Telegraph Sport looks at the 32 teams at World Cup 2014, assesses how they managed to secure qualification, identifes the managers and predicts whether they should be considering their options before or after the tournament. Who will illuminate the tournament and join the pantheon alongside Paolo Rossi, Bobby Moore, Pele, Willie Johnston? (And that Zaire player whose grasp of the laws of the game was somewhat sketchy...) But more than that, the answer to the crucial question of how long you will have to wait for each national anthem to be over is revealed - for example, you can not only make a cup of tea during Uruguay's but also a three-course meal, complete a tax return, whistle the Hallelujah Chorus and learn Serbo-Croat. Those anthems are also boiled down to their pith to give you a flavour of meaning while we also provide a handy guide on how to go native in 32 different ways should you wish to adopt a new team and have a desire to become acquainted with facepaint.

Amy Williams to take on London 2012 cycling route - Telegraph	“I’m really lucky to be based where I am in Bath, surrounded by amazing scenic countryside, and some hills. So when I can, I lose myself down some little country roads and hope that the scenery will distract me from the burning in my legs!” Like thousands of others taking part in the 100-mile cycle, Amy is a little worried about the hills in Surrey, but is confident she will be ready for them come August 10. “Box Hill is the section I am most nervous about,” she continues. “Hill training will be crucial for this event. However, I have been making sure to include some pretty gruelling climbs in training, so I’m hoping it won’t be too much of a shock.” Amy has been taking nutrition seriously, too, and adds: “Before heading off on a long ride it’s important to have had some carbohydrates to fuel your body, and hydration is key to any endurance training. "It is also important to remember recovery: your body needs the right combination of protein and carbs to help your muscles recover, especially after hitting the hills.” Her target time? “I’m hoping to ideally finish in about six-and-a-half hours, but I think the most important thing is to enjoy the ride and cross the finish line whenever you can.” Get involved Last year the inaugural Prudential RideLondon was such a success that this summer’s event, on August 9-10, 2014, is expected to be even bigger.

World Cup stadiums: a venue guide for Brazil 2014 - Telegraph	Local hero... Rivaldo grew up in the city and began his career at local club Santa Cruz before moving on to bigger and better things. At his peak, the forward spent five years in Spain at Barcelona, winning the World and European player of the year award in 1999. He played 74 times for his country. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stadium name: Arena da Amazônia - Manaus Capacity 44,000 How complete is it? Was supposed to be finished in early 2013, but is behind schedule and will not be completed until the spring. Average temperature in June 27.5C Average rainfall in June 84mm Famous for... being situated in the heart of the Amazon rain forest. It is the gateway to the Amazon basin and a popular tourist destination as a result. England manager Roy Hodgson was keen to avoid playing any World Cup 2014 games here as it is so far from team’s Rio De Janeiro base, but likely to be popular with fans possessing a sense of adventure Local hero... Francisco Lima Govinho was a defensive midfielder who spent the majority of his career in Italy, most notably for Roma, but also Bologna and Brescia. Like so many Brazilians, he was good enough to play in one of Europe’s top divisions but never got a game for the national team. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stadium name: Arena Pantanal (Cuiaba) Capacity 43,000 How complete is it? Has been plagued by delays since construction began in 2010 and is still several months away from completion Average temperature in June 24.1C Average rainfall in June 15.5mm Famous for… it is one of Brazil’s hottest cities with temperatures regularly exceeding 40C in the hottest months. Founded in 1727 following the discovery of gold in the area, Cuiaba is situated in the geographical centre of the South American continent, and is also in the middle of Brazilian cattle country, which ensures cowboy hats are a most-have fashion item. Local Hero: Liverpool’s Brazilian international Lucas Leiva was born Dourados, which is a neighbouring town in the state of Mato Grosso. Began his career at Gremio and moved to Anfield for £5m in 2007. A vital member of both club and national side. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stadium name: Arena das Dunas (Natal) Capacity 43,000 How complete is it? It was later than promised but the stadium is built, taking just over two years to finish. Average temperature in June 25C Average rainfall in June 210mm Famous for... a really big tree. The Maior cajueiro do mundo is the biggest cashew tree in the world. Entered into the Guinness Book of Records In 1994 as the tree which covers the largest area, 8,400 square metres, making it larger than most football pitches Local hero.. Marinho Chagas was an early example of a left-back who could defend well but also attack like a winger. Played for Brazil in the 1974 World Cup and won 36 caps. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stadium name: Estádio do Maracanã (Rio de Janeiro) Capacity: 78,838 How complete is it? The renovated stadium was completed last June, when England fans will recall a temporary threat to their friendly in Brazil going ahead as a safety certificate was confirmed. Fifa say everything is in working order now. It will hst the final this summer. Average temperature in June 22°C Average rainfall in June 3.2 inches Famous for...With a population of 6.3 million, Rio conjures images of idyllic beaches, carnivals and a samba beat. The Corcovado and Sugarloaf mountains are among the most visited landmarks on the planet and it will be the destination most fans dream of making their base. Local hero Ronaldo, Romario and Zizinho (described by Pele as the best player he ever saw) are among the many football Gods born in Rio, but for a certain generation Zico, the maestro of the 1982 World Cup, is the definitive Brazilian footballer. He was recently voted third behind Pele and Garrincha as the nation’s greatest. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stadium name: Arena de Itaquera (Sao Paulo) Capacity: 68,000 How complete is it? Following last month’s tragic accident when two workers lost their lives erecting the stadium roof, it is scheduled to be complete by the end of February. However, this may be an ambitious target. Average temperature in June 22°C Average rainfall in June 2.2 inches Famous for...A staggering 20 million people reside in the metropolis of São Paulo, but the startling contrast between rich and poor make the city one of the diverse in the world. It is considered Brazil’s most culturally vibrant city, its restaurants and bistros making it the cuisine capital. Local hero Cafu and Roberto Carlos are among the numerous luminaries who honed their skills on São Paulo’s streets, but it was Arthur Friedenreich, the son of German/African immigrants, who broke through racial barriers at the start of the 20th century. Friedenreich was Brazil’s first black professional footballer. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stadium name: Estadio Mineirao (Belo Horizonte) Capacity: 64,00 How complete is it? The redevelopment of existing stadium (new lower tier, roof extension and internal upgrades) was completed in December, 2012, making this venue one of the best equipped at this stage (according to Fifa). Average temperature in June 25°C Average rainfall in June 0.6 inches Famous for...The peculiar road of Rua do Amendoim, where cars placed in neutral gear go up the sloping street rather than down. It is a tourist curiosity, attributed to the powerful magnetic field in the surrounding area. Belo Horizonte (‘beautiful horizon’) also lists tasting the famous delicacy ‘liver with aubergine’ at Central Market at number one on its list of ’20 things you must do in the city’ . Local hero Tostao, a member of the 1970 World Cup winning team, scored 32 goals in 52 games for what is considered the greatest side there has been. He once scored 47 goals in one game in his schooldays. With 300 career goals to his name, injury forced his retirement at just 25. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stadium name: Arena da Baixada (Curitiba) Capacity: 41, 456 How complete is it? Fifa’s internal reports say it is 83 per cent complete, the pitch causing particular concern. Work is scheduled to be finished for February but this stadium is one of those causing particular worry. Average temperature in June 18°C Average rainfall in June 3.9 inches Famous for…Curitiba is translated from Portuguese as ‘many pine trees’ and has the distinction of being one of the shortest lived capital cities – three days in 1969 courtesy of the reign of the military junta. With its botanic gardens and stylistic architecture, it is regarded one of the prettiest and desirable cities in Brazil to live. Local hero The record goalscorer of Curitiba FC was Duillio Dias, who scored 202 times between 1954-64. Unearthing talent to match those from Rio and São Paulo has proved tricky, but Premier League watchers will be interested to know Manchester United’s ex-midfielder Klebberson started his career with city rivals Atlético Paranaense. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stadium name: Estadio Nacional de Brasilia (Brasilia) Capacity: 70,064 How complete is it? The stadium was completed in May this year, replacing the dismantled Estadio Nacional Mané Garrincha. Average temperature in June: 26C Average rainfall in June: 3 per cent Famous for: The Brazilian capital, Brasilia is the city that claims to have been built in 2,000 days and boasts such historic landmarks as the Cathedral, the National Congress and the Legion of Goodwill Temple. The city is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Local hero: AC Milan forward Kaka was born in the satellite city of Gama and remains arguably Brasilia's most famous export. Began his career at São Paulo before a fee of around £7million in 2003, later moving to Real Madrid. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stadium name: Arena Castelao (Fortaleza) Capacity: 67,037 How complete is it: Fully completed in December 2012, the Castelao is now an all-seater stadium and now has a larger roof and an underground car park. Average temperature in June: 29.6C Average rainfall in June: 16 per cent Famous for: Renowned as one of Brazil's most vibrant cities, Monday nights in Fortaleza have become immortalised by the 'El Pirata' nightclub which was branded "the craziest place on Earth" by the New York Times. Local hero: Bolton Wanderers fans may remember Mario Jardel with a shudder, or a chuckle. Cruelly nicknamed 'Lardel' due to his hefty waistline, the forward only made seven appearances under Sam Allardyce. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stadium name: Arena Fonte Nova - Salvador Capacity: 55,000 How complete is it? The stadium was officially opened in April but a month later a huge segment of the roof collapsed due to torrential overnight rain, but officials are optimistic there will be no problems. Average temperature in June: 26.5C Average rainfall in June: 23.C Famous for: Salvador is known as the capital of happiness in Brazil and hosts the Central do Carnaval, one of the country's most famous annual celebrations. The Fonte Nova appears quite incongrous in the city due to its space-age design. Local hero: Bebeto. The former Brazil international, now 49, was born in Salvador and is revered in the city, named as one of the six ambassadors for the 2014 World Cup. Started his career at tiny Salvador club Vitoria. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stadium name: Estadio Jose Pinheiro Borda (Porto Alegre) Capacity: TBC (est 50,287) How complete is it? The stadium is still under construction and is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Average temperature in June: 19.7C Average rainfall in June: 12 per cent Famous for: The state of Rio Grande do Sul is the homeplace for current Brazil manager Luiz Felipe Scolari and his predecessor Mano Menezes, and also famous for the Gre-Nal, a bitter derby between local enemies Gremio and Internacional. Local hero: Ronaldinho, the 33-year old Brazil forward, was born in Porto Alegre and won the Fifa World Player of the Year Award in 2004 and 2005. Also known as 'Gaucho' to distinguish him from Ronaldo, his former fellow international.	sports

Brazil vs Germany, World Cup 2014: as it happened - Telegraph	Henry Winter's match report: "This was an embarrassment to a famous shirt, a point their furious supporters made splenetically." Paul Hayward: "The indignity of this night will haunt Brazilian football for generations." Let's grab some of your views: Dave Stults, you have the honour: This World Cup has been full of so many shocking moments! If someone would have told me what would have happened in the Group Stages,Costa Rica's triumph, with Suarez, Neymar's injury, and now this catastrophe I wouldn't have believed it! Not for one second! What I don't understand is how Brazilian players could let this happen to them in Brazil! This surely must be the worst moment in Brazilian sport's history. David Luiz at the end of the match Here is Manish Joshi: Is Brazil trying to ensure james rodriguez/columbia doesn't get the golden boot...revenge for Neymar...??!! Sad way to go about it.. It breaks the heart that your sociology analysis is turning out so true...Hope the Brazillian taxpayer will raise questions rather than go about doing the samba...Something like that happened during Commonwealth games here in India..it started a cycle of questions that booted out the Indian National Congress, a 140 years old party, from its 10 year National government.. Chukwunenye Nnebe is one of the first to take a stab at the "why?" My take -- it all starts w/ the coach (Scolari) and then the players. From the 1st whistle of the WC opening match, Brazil has never played a cohesive and united game. Their lack of team play was evident in their close results up until the Germans exposed their weakness. No man-on-man marking, open field for the Germans after the 10th minute to play w/ the ball and get their passing game open, and the open look at the goal ended up in the final result! I've never seen a lackluster and indisciplined effort from the Brazilian players... they were truly an embarassing team to be fielded. No midfield player, no wingers, no creative ball passing, or tactical running... surely, Kaka and Robinho would have brought a difference to the midfield and the attacking forward play. Scolari stumbles AGAIN! Nick Bishop has a dibble: Germany have played exceptionally well and with style, yet they have such a well drilled functionality that they will exploit any weaknesses. Brazil lacked a captain, any urgency or ambition. At 0 3, they were gone and punch drunk. Such was the precision and ruthlessness of the Germans that we were provided a freak scoreline against an insipid team lacking any leaders. Old skool vidiprinter shout-out Here's Søren H. Assmann: Germany is still in shock. Shock and awe. I still wish to hug all those crying Brazilian fans, they can't help it that their team just went tactically for all-out offense against the best counter break team on this planet. Some records: Klose's 16th World Cup goal, all-time record. Germany 222 World Cup goals, now two ahead of Brazil for most goals at World Cups. The 1:0 by Müller was the 2000th goal of the Deutscher Fussball-Bund (DFB) international football game history. And if the scoreline stands, it's the highest defeat of any team in a World Cup semifinal. And the highest defeat for Brazil ever. Brian Doyle had the solution: At 3 nil someone, anyone, ideally the captain, on the Brazil squad should have quickly grabbed his team mates threatened them all and then told them to calm down and regroup. Chapeau to snapper Laurence Griffiths But I think we will give the last word to Karla, who says: Oh my god. This is unbelievable! As a German myself I should probably be more happy about my team winning this game... but.. I'm utterly gobsmacked -- a win really shouldn't feel this bad, should it? This is like watching a train wreck. But well. We're winning...so. I guess: Yay? Hm.. 90+ mins: No futher misery, the referee finally stops the fight. GOAL! Hey! Not so bad! Brazil have a goal. A breakway, for once Germany don't get back in time, and for once the Brazilian forwards show some composure. Oscar is the man who slots it home, good finish. Brazil 1 Germany 7 (Oscar 90) 88 mins: Germany should have had eight, Ozil sent racing clear but he drags his shot just wide. Jonathan Rodriguez: My name is Jonathan Rodriguez and: this is what revenge feels like! When Brazil beat Germany in their home world cup. This is what revenge should look like, as anything but pleasant. 87 mins: Some of these are career low performances. Hulk, the poor bloke is a laughing stock. Ditto Fred. Luiz, well all the bad bits have been in full effect. Marcelo probably the worst of the lot, just wandering up the left wing, missing from his post time and again. In the time it's taken me to type that, he has lost the ball 30 yards from goal and luckily for him Schurrle fails with the cross. And now Marcelo has gone missing and let Lahm in. Literally, two separate horrible mistakes in ten seconds. Bernard has shot wildly over. 85 mins: Good move from Brazil ends with Ramires shooting from outside the box. 84 mins: Brazil playing well in fits and starts. Sounds like John Thiongo is just going to give Russia 2016 a miss altogether. Very sad for Brazil. I sympathize with the Brazilian people because they had high hopes of their team. See you in Qatar 80 mins: Paulinho knocks it down for Marcelo, who shoots a couple of yards wide. Neuer rushes to get the ball to restart. Steady on old chap. "Neuer is programmed to win," says Martin Keown. That was Ivan Drago, wasn't it Martin? Brazil fans now applauding that goal. Whatever gets you through the night at this stage. Robert: Let's get some perspective here, even England beat Brazil in their last friendly. GOAL! Nope. That is the best goal yet. Surging run down the left, inside to Schurrle and he has lashed it home with a magnificent finish. Brazil 0 Germany 7 (Schurrle 79) 76 mins: Marcelo gives it away cheaply. Handbags between Luiz and Muller, the Brazil man looks like he's losing the rag. Red card for the captain would be a fitting final indignity. Ref chills everyone down. Michelle Mcmahon: Germany needs to remember they are guests and have some manners. No more! On the other hand...The German (Shepherd) I live with is strutting. Annoying. Typical. German. He's winning his predictions. 75 mins: Several minutes have elapsed without the Germans scoring, the big losers, so they bring on Julian Draxler - who always sounds like a techno DJ to me. This the musical equivalent of nosebleed gabber at 11am in a Rotterdam shipping container yard. for the Brazil players/fans. The super Khedira is the man who goes off. 70 mins: As to David's question, Brazil's attack has totally sucked, like their defence. I guess that the defensive mistakes are more glaring. 69 mins: Big Phil puts Fred out of his misery, not a green tent job fortunately, but takes him off and brings on Willian. The crowd boo Fred off. Now they boo Fred every time the camera picks him out sitting on the bench. Harsh. David: Alan would you agree that with the terrible defending by Brazil perhaps Thiago Silva is a bigger loss than Neymar? GOAL! Best goal of the lot I think. So patient, so clinical from Germany. Khedira the creator, he plays it into Lahm, who has surged forward up the right. Skipper has the composure to pick out a man in the box and it's Schurrle who has time to place the shot past the keeper. So many of the finishes have been so calm, made to look so easy. Nobody has had to do anything much to take his goal, the Brazil defence just being so out of position. Brazil 0 Germany 6 (Schurrle 69) 68 mins: Dante the first man in the book. 67 mins: Fred has what looks like a brilliant chance but he is off-side. 66 mins: Scheweinsteiger with a raking ball, excellent save from Cesar to cut it out before Schurrle can nick it. 64 mins: Muller, what a player this boy is, down the left, opening Brazil up on the break, crosses and that's only an inch away from finding the free and fabulous Schurrle. Andrew Holgate: In 1954 Austria came from 3-0 down to win 7-5 vs Switzerland, while England and Belgium shared a 4-4 draw. Both record games (goals scored in one game, biggest deficit to win, highest score draw). 63 mins: Maicon reckons he has been brought down in the box. The Germans reckon Maicon should have a yellow for diving. 61 mins: And now Khedira and Muller link up well, the latter curling a fine shot at goal. Excellent save. Juan Carlos Gonzalez-Najera: It's pointless to bring it up now, but again, why is Fred in this team? Surely he cannot be among the best Brazilian attackers in the world? Because if he is, Brazil has a very long road to travel before they can come back for the next cup. 60 mins: Normal service has been resumed, Muller skips around the keeper and that's a heroic dive by Cesar to nick the ball off him. 58 mins: Another chance for Brazil, playing pretty well now, but sadly it falls to Fred who, well, you can guess the rest. Wrong Said Fred. 57 mins: Klose comes off. Not a bad hour's work. Schurrle on Robert Stewart: At current rate of progress Brazil will come fifth in the third place play-off. On a more serious note one cannot help but feel sorry for the Brazilians who have ended up paying for the extravaganza. Let's hope they redeem some pride. 55 mins: Brazil all over the Germans right now. Muller having a magnificent game at front and now back as well, charging back and hurling himself into important tackles. Thulisani: Good Lord, I didnt think missin Neymar wld take Brazil so out of it, I too wish they cld just throw in the towel(s). Funny too earlier today I read an article on 5 reasons why Germany will will, well maybe there is saving face for Brasil coz there was 3reasons they cld hold off Germany too. 53 mins: Paulinho! The sloppy Germans are all over the place, disgraceful, they'll be wanting to raise their game here or, well, they'll only win eight nil. Lofted ball over to Paulinho on the left, he's got time and space. He has to score. He hits it straight at the keeper. Comes back at him but he fails with the follow-up as well. Neuer with the double save. Lamas: I wanted Brazil punished, but not this bad. At least it won't get as bad Australia vs American Samoa. Right? 52 mins: Oh dear. Oh Brazil. They should have scored. Oscar at the fore, they've opened up the Germans and here's Fred with the chance! He just sort of tumbles over, like a sad and dying tree. Jean Sullivan: As a neutral for this match, it is still a nightmare. And just when you want to say that Germany has deserved this blow-out they seem to be thinking it’s fine to push Brazil players over at will. Is there such a thing as a clean game at this stage? 50 mins: Brazil play their best stuff of the match, and Ramires gets to the byline, that's a good effort by Neuer to cut out the cross. Sai: Oh My Gosh!!! I've refreshed my browser after I saw scoreboard changing from Brazil 0 -2 Germany to Brazil 0 -4 Germany. Few minutes later when I saw Brazil 0 -5 Germany, I thought there might virus/spam attack on my browser. I'm in the office on the west coast of USA -I do not know if Germany is prudent or if Brazil is lackadaisical today. 48 mins: Decent start from Brazil, Maicon wit the ball in, Oscar into the box, tries to dink it over the German defender and just runs into him. Ref not buying the penalty claim. 46 mins: Some subs. Fernandinho is the lucky man to be taken off. Paulinho can have a dose. The hapless Hulk comes off for Ramires. For the Germans, Hummels gets a rest and Mertesacker gets his chance. 21.01 Bad news for Brazil fans: the second half is beginning. 22.00 Betting man/woman? Our betting expert Barry writes: "HT in Belo Horizonte and – didn’t think I’d be writing this – in the correct score betting on Betfair six nil Germany is just 4/1, while 7-0 is 9/1" 21.59 Couple more emails. Helle Adamsen You may go all German tonight!!!!!! I just feel sorry for the ordinary Brazilian people who have paid for this extravanza - where has the original Brazilian football gone off to? But give Angela Merkel and her German team a little credit - they reign supreme in Europe!! Sad - maybe, but nice to see Europe still have a touch. I bet the humiliation will be total by the end of the match, but will feel sorry for the Brazilian population, they deserved something better. Anna says: "We are as astonished as you are...they just panicked!! What a shame! Can they go home now?? 21.57 This picture from our German football blogger Randall Hauk HALF TIME BRAZIL 0 GERMANY 5 (AND YES THAT'S FIVE GOALS) Not sure I've seen anything like that. Khedira the pick, a lot of the Germans very good but wow. Brazil. Just utterly awful, so slow, so disorganised, so confused. Feel genuinely sorry for them. Who better than Alan Hansen to assess this defensive misery? "In the annals of time there has never been a game like this, a humiliation like this. It is about four levels below rock bottom. It is embarrassing. David Luiz is the captain and he has abandoned ship. Someone had to hold this unit together and he has gone missing." Oh, Bernard. Let's grab some emails - thanks for writing sorry it's taken a while to get them up. Daniel Forlines: "Don't think Brazil has what it takes to get it done, especially after seeing Muller in the box, WIDE OPEN. Haven't seen a Germany W in the Cup since I was 3. It's overdue!" Tony Gill: "5-0 at the half. Who do you think will be taking the penalties later on?" Andy: "Scotland, it's just like watching Scotland..." And here is Kiran Kulkarni: Is this a joke? Am I watching a Football match being played at Estádio Mineirão, Belo Horizonte or is this a video footage from Playstation? It's 2 am here in India! Am I watching a live football game? Am I dreaming? Please confirm the scoreline :) If this is happening in real world, will you pass my message to Scholari to take moral responsibility & quit at half time? And.. You can take charge of Brazilian Team through Skype or something & restore order on the pitch. 43 mins: BBC commentator: “Joachim Low is strolling around his technical area like a man on a walk through a bluebell wood.” Yeah, that does sound pretty annoying. And German. Brazil have a freekick. The refereeing equivalent of the pity bunk-up. It comes to nowt. 41 mins: A rare chance for Brazil to get out of their own half as Oscar has a run at goal. Stopped by a brick wall of German. Loads and loads of emails coming in, we'll get to them at the half if that is okay. 39 mins: Ozil with a lovely run, it looks for a minute that Brazil are going to be assuming the position once again as Klose and Muller exchange passes, but Dante - he's in a circle of hell alright - manages to get a leg in the way. 37 mins: The Germans are massed on the edge of the Brazil box. Ozil, Kroos, Khedira and the rest all playing neat little passes, looking to slide the knife into the ribs again. Gustavo panics - they're all panicking, to be honest - and hauls down Muller. The Germans fight over the freekick like hyenas who've found an unattended extra large mighty meaty and it's Ozil who gets the chance. He scoops the ball harmlessly over. 36 mins: Poor Brazil. Nearly another hour of this to go. They really should hva a mercy rule. 34 mins: The inquest will go on for a while. At the moment, it is hard to know how to explain this. Brazil just so open. Where the hell are all their players? The Germans break again, four of them at high pace, lucky for Brazil the ball from Kroos (I think) is for once not to a man. 32 mins: Kroos with a shot, it hits Fernandinho in the chest, shades of handball I might add, but the Brazilians are spared that at least. The Germans surround the ref. Just a corner. GOAL! It's five. This is brutal to watch. It's like Brazil have been shot with tranquliser darts and Germany can just walk around them. The Germans nearly at walking pace on the edge of the box, Mesut Ozil and Miroslav Klose exchanging passes, Luiz the latest man to have a nightmare, and Khedira - who has been the main architect of this cathedral of destruction - now has a chance to get on the scoresheet with a clean strike of his own. Brazil 0 Germany 5 (Khedira 29) GOAL! Did I say that was a nightmare? THIS is a nightmare. It's four. Fernandinho has been caught in possession and Brazil have been opened up like a Kinder Egg. Kroos slots the ball home and it's four. Carnage. Brazil 0 Germany 4 (Kroos 26) GOAL! Oh my goodness. Ozil feeds Lahm, the ball comes across from the right. The Germans get a stroke of luck that they don't really need as Thomas Muller has an airshot... that means it just flies to Kroos unmarked at the edge of the box and he hits a hard, crisp, low sho. Three goals. Oh Brazil. This is nightmare. Brazil 0 Germany 3(Kroos 25) GOAL! Oh no. Oh dear. Miroslav Klose has made it two. A ball in from the right, Fernandinho tries to intercept but steps over it. Kroos plays it into the box and Muller makes a lovely little layoff-dummy. It falls to Klose, who hits his shot straight at the keeper. It rebounds straight to him though and Klose doesn't miss a second time. Klose has the all-time World Cup scoring record. Congrats. Brazil 0 Germany 2 (Klose 23) 20 mins: Klose holds it up, holds off his man and shoots at the keeper. I fear for Brazil here. They are so open. 18 mins: Brazil throwing the kitchen sink at the Germans, Marcelo now frees Oscar, who twists in the area and crosses. Just cut out. And the Germans look to break, they look seriously dangerous on the break. 16 mins: Oscar comes deep to pick up the ball and he's slid it through to Marcelo, who bursts into the box and goes down under a challenge from Lahm. It's a wonderful tackle, one of the best you will ever see. The Germans give Marcelo a rub-down for diving, there's a bit of shoving, and the ref steps in. Just a corner. Poor corner. 15 mins: Butch Oscar is the one who might be able to unpick this German defence. 14 mins: Now poor Hulk has hoofed the ball miles into touch. He looks like he would be a useful signing at inside centre, if any rugby union teams are watching. David Lander: With that goal Müller ties 1954 final hero Helmut Rahn on 10 world cuo goals. Rahn took 10 games, Müller a "slow" 12 games 13 mins: Brazil mount a series of spirited forrays in response, but the Germans are well organised, Brian, and they're well back and in numbers. Luiz starts a good counter but Hulk dallies too long on the ball. GOAL! GERMANY! Oh Brazil. Gutting. They've left Muller totally unmarked in the box, this is criminal defending, the winner of the Golden Boot in the last cup, the opposition's most lethal finisher... just left to his own devices near the back post to sidefoot the ball into the net. Shocker. "I would be embarrassed if I gave my opposite number that sort of space," says Martin Keown. Brazil 1 Germany 0 (Muller 11) 10 mins: Khedira's finding a lot space to break forward on the inside right cahnnel. He's won a corner. 9 mins: Open game, Muller putting Marcelo under big pressure, lucky for Brazil's dodgy full back the ref reckons the German fouled him. Nidhin writes: Hi I am Nidhin. I still believe Brazil will win today's match.....Brazilian supporter from India. 7 mins: Khedira opens Brazil up! Cross comes all the way across the area, dangerously, and Muller spots Khedira free in the area, he connects with a crisp drive that, luckily for Brazil, hits Toni Kroos in the badonkadonk. 5 mins: Hectic start, Brazil playing with drive and heart but not much composure. Big challenges from both teams in the centre. The first crunchy foul is not far away. 3 mins: Excellent surging start from Brazil, the crowd roaring them on, Luiz frees Hulk with a fine ball and Neuer has to look sharp to cut out the cross. Carlos asks: Can you ask Indra Beharry (just emailed you on the live blog) whether she knows Corporal Beharry that won a V.C. medal? I believe Corporal Beharry came from the Carribean. 2 mins: The Germans clear that, not after the ref has had a word with Fernandinho for trampling on the keeper's feet. Marcelo has a shot from distance, not too far wide. 1 mins: Here we go. The Germans kick off, but they have lost it quickly. The crowd roar. Fernandinho has won an early corner down the right. 20.59 And the Germans. 20.58 Here are the Brazil XI. 20.57 Still, wonderful performance of the anthem. 20.56 Brazil line up. David Luiz and Julio Cesar is holding up Neymar's shirt! Come off it. This is surely too much? He's not dead! Is he? He's not dead, right? 20.55 Germany's splendid national anthem. I think I hear a few whistles. Nothing like England fans 'welcoming' an opponent but a hostile atmosphere nonetheless. 20.52 Hope for Brazil's sake they've got another generous ref. If they go down to ten then the Germans will cut them apart. 20.46 An email from Indra Beharry. Hi Indra! Hi my name is Indra. I live in Trinidad and Tobago. I've been following the matches and am supporting Germany to win the cup. I love their style of play in my opinion they are the only team that shows team spirit and professionalism in their game They got discipline. And David Jane writes: I strongly believe that Germany is going to win this game and meet Netherland on the finals. 20.45 It's not hard to see why Gary has been universally acclaimed as British football's most insightful pundit. 20.42 So Bernard is the replacement for Neymar. A chance to shine for Bernard. The Day of the Bernard. Sorry. It's hard to take seriously. And I speak as an Alan, not exactly a cool name in its own right. 20.40 Heh. I enjoyed this from Manuel Lagos: This game has all the ingredients of an epic story. The Brazilians with their belief in God and the spirit world against the Germans and their belief in technology and the evil mythical machine God. The Federation vs The Borg. Humans vs Na'vi. Rocky vs Drago. Oh who will win? 20.37 BREAKING NEWS NEVER MIND THIS WORLD CUP RUBBISH: EVERTON HAVE SIGNED GARETH BARRY 20.34 Rio Ferdinand keeps it nice and simple. "They have lost their two best players. Can David Luiz come in and control that back four? And without Neymar, who can provide the flair?" Meanwhile, CZ writes: Germany should win based on the code of football. Their first choice is just to play. Not to injure. I have a really big suggestion for you. Do you think you can write an article and make some fuss about "line-technology "? Since we already have goal technology and proven to be a success , I think line tech is next. I have seen too many offsides called incorrectly and these calls really did affect the outcome. Some teams won and some lost just because of bad off side calling. Thanks! 20.34 C Alberto, obvs. 20.33 The images are so familiar, so beloved. I guarantee you will guess the goal from this terrible blurry grab. 20.30 Right then. Eyes down, look in. 20.24 Oh God they've all got Neymar caps on. 20.20 Refreshed and refuelled by some landfill-grade sushi, I am back. Readers, who is going to win this football match and why? I really need to know. 20.08 Anyway. Enough GCSE sociology. Who is playing in this football match? Brazil: Julio Cesar, Maicon, Dante, Luiz, Marcelo, Gustavo, Fernandinho, Hulk, Oscar, Bernard, Fred. Subs: Jefferson, Dani Alves, Paulinho, Maxwell, Henrique, Ramires, Hernanes, Willian, Jo, Victor. Germany: Neuer, Lahm, Boateng, Hummels, Howedes, Schweinsteiger, Khedira, Muller, Kroos, Ozil, Klose. Subs: Zieler, Grosskreutz, Ginter, Schurrle, Podolski, Draxler, Durm, Mertesacker, Gotze, Kramer, Weidenfeller. Referee: Marco Rodriguez (Mexico) 20.03 I guess it's hard to think of anything other than sport that could unite a huge developing nation. Actually, not a sport. A star sportsman. Actual sport is too unpredictable and complex. Loving a sportsman though, well that's an easy get for even the most socially excluded person. But my God the pressure and the weight of expectation and the unreasonable demands. Sachin Tendulkar might know how Neymar feels, but I bet there's not many others who do. Nobody in the West, I think. I mean, sure, Wayne Rooney is under pressure, but only the very saddest of the sad in England take it as seriously as all that. 20.00 I'm not saying "it's only a game." We're all far too into sport to say something that glib and shallow. But, you know, it is only a game. When you think of the corruption, the inequality, the poverty... and the huge pressure heaped on these young men to distract everyone from it. It's a wonder they don't all go quite mad. 19.58 This is the beef with Brazil, then, I think. This bit. "I will have my heart on the field to help these players and Neymar’s heart will be out there too." It all feels very overblown, almost unsustainably so, the hysteria and the hype. He's a footballer, a very good one, who has been injured and will miss the match. He's not dead. He's not crippled. He's not, also, living in a shack and being beat up by the police. The mania of Brazil, which we used to patronisingly go "Oh ho ho ho, samaba football, aren't they passionate, phwoar look at that girl in the bikini..." It feels somehow a bit slick now, a bit Disney, given all the problems in the country. Keep smiling and don't look at the poor people, Majesty. Bread and circuses, and all that. 19.55 Here is Paul Hayward's preview of the match. Brazil are trying to surf to the World Cup final on emotion. “I will have my heart on the field to help these players and Neymar’s heart will be out there too,” said Thiago Silva, the host nation’s captain whose appeal against suspension failed on the eve of their semi-final with Germany. Silva, who called Juan Camilo Zuniga’s challenge on Neymar in the Colombia game a “coward” tackle, will watch from the sidelines in Belo Horizonte but has seized the role of rabble rouser and cheerleader. “This is a derby in world football and everyone wants to watch this match,” he said. If Brazil’s fans seem overcome with feeling, try listening to the coaching staff and players. “We will not have Neymar but we have another 22 players who have been hand-picked because they are special,” said Luiz Felipe Scolari, Brazil’s coach. “I have a fantastic group of players. I’m sure that we are going to play for us, for Neymar, but also for the goal of reaching the final.” When Brazil score at this World Cup the noise from the fireworks is more sonic boom than bonfire night. The skies crash and shake. These turbo-pyrotechnics express not only the people’s love but an edge of aggression that also shows in the team’s increasingly robust play. 19.48 Are you of a betting persuasion? If you fancy Brazil to do it, they're generally around 10/11 to qualify and the Germans basically evens. To win in 90 minutes, the Brazils are 7/4 and Joachim Low's lot are about 2/1. The draw priced around 9/4. On Betfair it’s money back as a free bet if the match goes to Extra Time. All Semi-Final Games. All Customers. Selected Markets 19.46 An email from Nic. Germany look faster every time I watch them play. I do not think Brazil can keep up with them. On the other side, Argentina, with their "suspect" defense and "very average" team apart from Messi, have only given up three goals this tournament, two to a very athletic Nigeria. (Although I will concede that they have also scored the fewest goals of the teams remaining.) And while their final two games should indeed be their most challenging of the tournament, Lionel & Company continue to produce exactly what is needed. Argentina are the only squad remaining to win every game thus far (without needing a penalty shootout), and they have won each game by exactly one goal. From earlier, thank you for assuming the less dubious implication of "bracket", the word used in the USA for the tree diagram of a tournament's elimination stage -- to be filled out before the tournament and compared with those of one's peers for taunting, shaming and often betting purposes. I will be more judicious in my attempts to avoid cross-cultural perversions going forward. 19.45 In reply to the question above, "who will win tonight?", Ainar writes: I will give it to Germany. Very generous of you, Ainar. Wait. You're not like a match-fixing overlord or something? 19.40 Ha. On the subject of the Neymask... 19.32 The Telegraph's Alan Smith has here run the rule over the men who will likely be starting tonight. Do you agree with his assessment of the key match-ups? 19.30 So no Nemyar for Brazil. We'll talk about the sad and serious implications of that in a bit, I guess. But meanwhile... Here are the men who might replace him, via Project Babb. 19.28 Maybe I have just seen too many horror films. 19.27 Those Prince William and Kate oneswere pretty terrifying, too. 19.25 None more creepy than a sportsman mask. This is the worst I have seen since Andrew Flintoff. (Foreign chums - he was an England cricketer). I give you, with all apologies, THE NEYMASK. 19.20 Digging this stat. 19.15 An email arrives from Muhammad Waleed: Microsoft has had used a specially designed software which assess Teams' overall record and some other information to predict results, which astoundingly proved to be right. My recommendation would be to use any FIFA game and it would produce the same result at cheap cost. Lastly, My prediction is Germany. Doesn't sound as outrageous as those anticipating brazil's win? Funnily enough, Muhammad, we've had some of our top experts working on JUST SUCH A PROJECT. Here is our Digital World Cup, with Thom Gibbs and JJ Bull. 19.10 Telegraph star man Henry Winter has done a Google hangout, in which our Germany and Brazil columnists Randall Hauk (@odroku) and Allen Chahad (@allenchahad), preview the match, including the options open to head coach Luis Felipe Scolari and the threat posed by free-scoring Thomas Muller. Have a butcher's here. 19.00 Splendid stuff. And as if that were not enough, how about this. It's a team of David Luizs. Of David Luizes. Of David Luizi. Anyway. You know what I mean. Actually, you won't know what I mean until you click on its full magnificence. Check it out on our Project Babb website. Brazilian sports website Globo Esporte have found an ingenious way for the world’s office-workers to waste time before Brazil v Germany kicks off, by giving them the chance to add any face they like to the unique hairline of one David Luiz. Here’s our David Luiz XI. An attacking lineup, perhaps, but marshalled well by Roy Keane and, erm, David Luiz at the back, in front of the safe hands of (yes, indeed) Sideshow Bob. James Rodriguez’s attacking instincts at left-back would be complemented by Louise’s eternally defensive instincts on the right side of defence. Up front, a delighted-looking Wayne Rooney forms a formidable partnership with Lionel Messi and Robin van Persie. Here's a sneak peek of the horror that lies ahead once you click. Don't say I didn't warn you. 18.55 I have been trawling the highways and byways of the internet, so you don't have to, and here are some of the best pre-game things that I have found. First up, and this is quite splendid, it's the Manic Street Preachers hit song Motorcycle Emptiness with its lyrics changed to incorporate the names of various German players. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you.... Mertesacker Emptiness. 18.50 Our first email of the evening comes from Nic Chimenti, who says: If Germany and Argentina win today and tomorrow, I successfully picked the final game and should win my bracket. This proves, as always, that picking your bracket at the last minute without analyzing the teams always produces better results. I am assuming bracket is some sort of American betting thing rather than London slang for cocaine, but good luck to Nic in his venture. Who do you think is going to win? 18.45 Evening all. Alan Tyers here. And World Cup semi-finals here! How exciting. A fascinating match in store as Brazil take on Germany. If you'd asked most neutrals before the tournament who they would want to win a semi out of these two, the response would surely have been utterly one-sided: Brasiiiiiiillll. And yet, it feels as if something has changed, over this World Cup. The cliche of sex, sand, samba and soccer was already wearing a little thin, but this particular team's pragmatic, hard-tackling approach has surely blown that away for a generation. The likes of Paulinho, Fernandinho, Hulk and Thiago Silva seem more Stoke than Samba, and without Neymar, there aren't many in this team who you would put in anything like the class of previous wearers of the famous yellow shirt. Function has totally trumped finesse. But if you want to talk about cliches, how about the efficient Germans? It would be stretching a point to call them a loveable team, but the clever probing of Ozil, the glorious free-running of Muller and the passing of Kroos can be a delight to watch. Not saying they would be a popular winner tonight, but in terms of footballing merit they are, to this neutral at least, more deserving than Brazil. Estadio Mineirao, Belo Horizonte Kick-off: 21.00 BST TV: BBC ONE. Today Football Columnist Henry Winter, together with Germany and Brazil columnists Randall Hauk (@odroku) and Allen Chahad (@allenchahad), discussed the options open to head coach Luis Felipe Scolari and the threat posed by free-scoring Thomas Muller. And who they think will win the match. Emotions are running high in Minas Gerais. Will the ice-cool Teutons vanquish the hot-blooded samba kings? Team news Brazil (Possible, 4-2-3-1): Cesar; Maicon, Luiz, Dante, Marcelo; Gustavo, Fernandinho; Willian, Oscar, Hulk; Fred. Germany (Possible, 4-3-3): Neuer; Lahm, Hummels, Boateng, Höwedes; Khedira, Schweinsteiger, Kroos; Özil, Müller, Götze. Referee: Marco Rodríguez (Mexico). Joachim Loew expects his Germany side to face a battle against tough-tackling Brazil when football's titans clash in Tuesday's World Cup semi-final with the host nation desperate to win the title for injured superstar Neymar. Germany want to avenge their 2002 final defeat to Brazil by knocking the hosts out in Belo Horizonte to reach Sunday's final in Rio de Janeiro. Brazil's quest to win a sixth title on the home soil, meanwhile, has been dealt a huge blow as they will not only be missing top scorer Neymar, but also suspended captain Thiago Silva after his appeal against the booking he received in the quarter-final win over Colombia was rejected on Monday. Neymar suffered a fractured vertebra towards the end of his side's bruising 2-1 win over the Colombians on Friday. Brazil paid the price for their rough treatment handed out to James Rodriguez as Colombia met fire-with-fire before Juan Zuniga's challenge on Neymar left the Selecao star in hospital. The hosts committed a tournament high 31 fouls against their fellow South Americans and Loew is hoping Mexican referee Marco Rodriguez, who missed Luis Suarez's bite on Giorgio Chiellini early in the competition, doesn't allow the game to get out of hand. "I hope the referee Rodriguez will clamp down, because I have seen in the last few matches that Brazil's physical energy is going beyond of what we see in Europe," said Loew. "If the games had been played in Europe, none of the 22 players would have finished the matches." Brazil boss Luiz Felipe Scolari admitted his side's passage to the last four hadn't been in the image of his country's once famed 'Jogo Bonito' style, but insisted winning on home soil was the most important thing. "We are doing everything step-by-step, not always in the most beautiful way but we are getting closer to playing the final at home and so everything is as scheduled." And Scolari has urged his squad to use Neymar's absence as an extra motivating factor. "The way Neymar spoke to the players made them understand that he had done his share and now we need to do our share. "Myself, the other players, all the Brazilian people. This match is very important, it could take us to the final. "We are playing for our country, it is everything we imagined and dreamed of, and also for Neymar." Willian is one of the prime candidates to replace Neymar and the Chelsea midfielder insists Brazil still have the quality to overcome the Germans. "We know the quality that we have. We are all very sad at losing him but we are now even stronger after what happened and we can continue to pursue our dream." Remarkably for two World Cup powerhouses with 24 semi-final appearances between them, this will be just their second meeting in the competition after the 2002 final. "It's an honour and a challenge to play against the hosts, but it have would be better to play Brazil in the final," said German midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger. "It doesn't matter how much experience you have, to play the hosts in this football-crazy country is something special." With Silva suspended, Germany are expected to meet a familiar face in centre-back Dante, which could help both sides, according to his Bayern Munich team-mate Schweinsteiger. "I hope he starts, we know him very well and know his strengths and weaknesses, but he also knows how we play," said Schweinsteiger. Germany are desperate to end their 24-year wait for a fourth World Cup title, while Loew's side are determined to avoid a defeat which would mean the third-place play-off - for the third consecutive time. "I really do not need that, that's something I want to rule out," joked captain Philipp Lahm, who was on losing teams in semi-finals at the 2006 and 2010 World Cup finals.

Brazil vs Germany, World Cup 2014: as it happened - Telegraph	Henry Winter's match report: "This was an embarrassment to a famous shirt, a point their furious supporters made splenetically." Paul Hayward: "The indignity of this night will haunt Brazilian football for generations." Let's grab some of your views: Dave Stults, you have the honour: This World Cup has been full of so many shocking moments! If someone would have told me what would have happened in the Group Stages,Costa Rica's triumph, with Suarez, Neymar's injury, and now this catastrophe I wouldn't have believed it! Not for one second! What I don't understand is how Brazilian players could let this happen to them in Brazil! This surely must be the worst moment in Brazilian sport's history. David Luiz at the end of the match Here is Manish Joshi: Is Brazil trying to ensure james rodriguez/columbia doesn't get the golden boot...revenge for Neymar...??!! Sad way to go about it.. It breaks the heart that your sociology analysis is turning out so true...Hope the Brazillian taxpayer will raise questions rather than go about doing the samba...Something like that happened during Commonwealth games here in India..it started a cycle of questions that booted out the Indian National Congress, a 140 years old party, from its 10 year National government.. Chukwunenye Nnebe is one of the first to take a stab at the "why?" My take -- it all starts w/ the coach (Scolari) and then the players. From the 1st whistle of the WC opening match, Brazil has never played a cohesive and united game. Their lack of team play was evident in their close results up until the Germans exposed their weakness. No man-on-man marking, open field for the Germans after the 10th minute to play w/ the ball and get their passing game open, and the open look at the goal ended up in the final result! I've never seen a lackluster and indisciplined effort from the Brazilian players... they were truly an embarassing team to be fielded. No midfield player, no wingers, no creative ball passing, or tactical running... surely, Kaka and Robinho would have brought a difference to the midfield and the attacking forward play. Scolari stumbles AGAIN! Nick Bishop has a dibble: Germany have played exceptionally well and with style, yet they have such a well drilled functionality that they will exploit any weaknesses. Brazil lacked a captain, any urgency or ambition. At 0 3, they were gone and punch drunk. Such was the precision and ruthlessness of the Germans that we were provided a freak scoreline against an insipid team lacking any leaders. Old skool vidiprinter shout-out Here's Søren H. Assmann: Germany is still in shock. Shock and awe. I still wish to hug all those crying Brazilian fans, they can't help it that their team just went tactically for all-out offense against the best counter break team on this planet. Some records: Klose's 16th World Cup goal, all-time record. Germany 222 World Cup goals, now two ahead of Brazil for most goals at World Cups. The 1:0 by Müller was the 2000th goal of the Deutscher Fussball-Bund (DFB) international football game history. And if the scoreline stands, it's the highest defeat of any team in a World Cup semifinal. And the highest defeat for Brazil ever. Brian Doyle had the solution: At 3 nil someone, anyone, ideally the captain, on the Brazil squad should have quickly grabbed his team mates threatened them all and then told them to calm down and regroup. Chapeau to snapper Laurence Griffiths But I think we will give the last word to Karla, who says: Oh my god. This is unbelievable! As a German myself I should probably be more happy about my team winning this game... but.. I'm utterly gobsmacked -- a win really shouldn't feel this bad, should it? This is like watching a train wreck. But well. We're winning...so. I guess: Yay? Hm.. 90+ mins: No futher misery, the referee finally stops the fight. GOAL! Hey! Not so bad! Brazil have a goal. A breakway, for once Germany don't get back in time, and for once the Brazilian forwards show some composure. Oscar is the man who slots it home, good finish. Brazil 1 Germany 7 (Oscar 90) 88 mins: Germany should have had eight, Ozil sent racing clear but he drags his shot just wide. Jonathan Rodriguez: My name is Jonathan Rodriguez and: this is what revenge feels like! When Brazil beat Germany in their home world cup. This is what revenge should look like, as anything but pleasant. 87 mins: Some of these are career low performances. Hulk, the poor bloke is a laughing stock. Ditto Fred. Luiz, well all the bad bits have been in full effect. Marcelo probably the worst of the lot, just wandering up the left wing, missing from his post time and again. In the time it's taken me to type that, he has lost the ball 30 yards from goal and luckily for him Schurrle fails with the cross. And now Marcelo has gone missing and let Lahm in. Literally, two separate horrible mistakes in ten seconds. Bernard has shot wildly over. 85 mins: Good move from Brazil ends with Ramires shooting from outside the box. 84 mins: Brazil playing well in fits and starts. Sounds like John Thiongo is just going to give Russia 2016 a miss altogether. Very sad for Brazil. I sympathize with the Brazilian people because they had high hopes of their team. See you in Qatar 80 mins: Paulinho knocks it down for Marcelo, who shoots a couple of yards wide. Neuer rushes to get the ball to restart. Steady on old chap. "Neuer is programmed to win," says Martin Keown. That was Ivan Drago, wasn't it Martin? Brazil fans now applauding that goal. Whatever gets you through the night at this stage. Robert: Let's get some perspective here, even England beat Brazil in their last friendly. GOAL! Nope. That is the best goal yet. Surging run down the left, inside to Schurrle and he has lashed it home with a magnificent finish. Brazil 0 Germany 7 (Schurrle 79) 76 mins: Marcelo gives it away cheaply. Handbags between Luiz and Muller, the Brazil man looks like he's losing the rag. Red card for the captain would be a fitting final indignity. Ref chills everyone down. Michelle Mcmahon: Germany needs to remember they are guests and have some manners. No more! On the other hand...The German (Shepherd) I live with is strutting. Annoying. Typical. German. He's winning his predictions. 75 mins: Several minutes have elapsed without the Germans scoring, the big losers, so they bring on Julian Draxler - who always sounds like a techno DJ to me. This the musical equivalent of nosebleed gabber at 11am in a Rotterdam shipping container yard. for the Brazil players/fans. The super Khedira is the man who goes off. 70 mins: As to David's question, Brazil's attack has totally sucked, like their defence. I guess that the defensive mistakes are more glaring. 69 mins: Big Phil puts Fred out of his misery, not a green tent job fortunately, but takes him off and brings on Willian. The crowd boo Fred off. Now they boo Fred every time the camera picks him out sitting on the bench. Harsh. David: Alan would you agree that with the terrible defending by Brazil perhaps Thiago Silva is a bigger loss than Neymar? GOAL! Best goal of the lot I think. So patient, so clinical from Germany. Khedira the creator, he plays it into Lahm, who has surged forward up the right. Skipper has the composure to pick out a man in the box and it's Schurrle who has time to place the shot past the keeper. So many of the finishes have been so calm, made to look so easy. Nobody has had to do anything much to take his goal, the Brazil defence just being so out of position. Brazil 0 Germany 6 (Schurrle 69) 68 mins: Dante the first man in the book. 67 mins: Fred has what looks like a brilliant chance but he is off-side. 66 mins: Scheweinsteiger with a raking ball, excellent save from Cesar to cut it out before Schurrle can nick it. 64 mins: Muller, what a player this boy is, down the left, opening Brazil up on the break, crosses and that's only an inch away from finding the free and fabulous Schurrle. Andrew Holgate: In 1954 Austria came from 3-0 down to win 7-5 vs Switzerland, while England and Belgium shared a 4-4 draw. Both record games (goals scored in one game, biggest deficit to win, highest score draw). 63 mins: Maicon reckons he has been brought down in the box. The Germans reckon Maicon should have a yellow for diving. 61 mins: And now Khedira and Muller link up well, the latter curling a fine shot at goal. Excellent save. Juan Carlos Gonzalez-Najera: It's pointless to bring it up now, but again, why is Fred in this team? Surely he cannot be among the best Brazilian attackers in the world? Because if he is, Brazil has a very long road to travel before they can come back for the next cup. 60 mins: Normal service has been resumed, Muller skips around the keeper and that's a heroic dive by Cesar to nick the ball off him. 58 mins: Another chance for Brazil, playing pretty well now, but sadly it falls to Fred who, well, you can guess the rest. Wrong Said Fred. 57 mins: Klose comes off. Not a bad hour's work. Schurrle on Robert Stewart: At current rate of progress Brazil will come fifth in the third place play-off. On a more serious note one cannot help but feel sorry for the Brazilians who have ended up paying for the extravaganza. Let's hope they redeem some pride. 55 mins: Brazil all over the Germans right now. Muller having a magnificent game at front and now back as well, charging back and hurling himself into important tackles. Thulisani: Good Lord, I didnt think missin Neymar wld take Brazil so out of it, I too wish they cld just throw in the towel(s). Funny too earlier today I read an article on 5 reasons why Germany will will, well maybe there is saving face for Brasil coz there was 3reasons they cld hold off Germany too. 53 mins: Paulinho! The sloppy Germans are all over the place, disgraceful, they'll be wanting to raise their game here or, well, they'll only win eight nil. Lofted ball over to Paulinho on the left, he's got time and space. He has to score. He hits it straight at the keeper. Comes back at him but he fails with the follow-up as well. Neuer with the double save. Lamas: I wanted Brazil punished, but not this bad. At least it won't get as bad Australia vs American Samoa. Right? 52 mins: Oh dear. Oh Brazil. They should have scored. Oscar at the fore, they've opened up the Germans and here's Fred with the chance! He just sort of tumbles over, like a sad and dying tree. Jean Sullivan: As a neutral for this match, it is still a nightmare. And just when you want to say that Germany has deserved this blow-out they seem to be thinking it’s fine to push Brazil players over at will. Is there such a thing as a clean game at this stage? 50 mins: Brazil play their best stuff of the match, and Ramires gets to the byline, that's a good effort by Neuer to cut out the cross. Sai: Oh My Gosh!!! I've refreshed my browser after I saw scoreboard changing from Brazil 0 -2 Germany to Brazil 0 -4 Germany. Few minutes later when I saw Brazil 0 -5 Germany, I thought there might virus/spam attack on my browser. I'm in the office on the west coast of USA -I do not know if Germany is prudent or if Brazil is lackadaisical today. 48 mins: Decent start from Brazil, Maicon wit the ball in, Oscar into the box, tries to dink it over the German defender and just runs into him. Ref not buying the penalty claim. 46 mins: Some subs. Fernandinho is the lucky man to be taken off. Paulinho can have a dose. The hapless Hulk comes off for Ramires. For the Germans, Hummels gets a rest and Mertesacker gets his chance. 21.01 Bad news for Brazil fans: the second half is beginning. 22.00 Betting man/woman? Our betting expert Barry writes: "HT in Belo Horizonte and – didn’t think I’d be writing this – in the correct score betting on Betfair six nil Germany is just 4/1, while 7-0 is 9/1" 21.59 Couple more emails. Helle Adamsen You may go all German tonight!!!!!! I just feel sorry for the ordinary Brazilian people who have paid for this extravanza - where has the original Brazilian football gone off to? But give Angela Merkel and her German team a little credit - they reign supreme in Europe!! Sad - maybe, but nice to see Europe still have a touch. I bet the humiliation will be total by the end of the match, but will feel sorry for the Brazilian population, they deserved something better. Anna says: "We are as astonished as you are...they just panicked!! What a shame! Can they go home now?? 21.57 This picture from our German football blogger Randall Hauk HALF TIME BRAZIL 0 GERMANY 5 (AND YES THAT'S FIVE GOALS) Not sure I've seen anything like that. Khedira the pick, a lot of the Germans very good but wow. Brazil. Just utterly awful, so slow, so disorganised, so confused. Feel genuinely sorry for them. Who better than Alan Hansen to assess this defensive misery? "In the annals of time there has never been a game like this, a humiliation like this. It is about four levels below rock bottom. It is embarrassing. David Luiz is the captain and he has abandoned ship. Someone had to hold this unit together and he has gone missing." Oh, Bernard. Let's grab some emails - thanks for writing sorry it's taken a while to get them up. Daniel Forlines: "Don't think Brazil has what it takes to get it done, especially after seeing Muller in the box, WIDE OPEN. Haven't seen a Germany W in the Cup since I was 3. It's overdue!" Tony Gill: "5-0 at the half. Who do you think will be taking the penalties later on?" Andy: "Scotland, it's just like watching Scotland..." And here is Kiran Kulkarni: Is this a joke? Am I watching a Football match being played at Estádio Mineirão, Belo Horizonte or is this a video footage from Playstation? It's 2 am here in India! Am I watching a live football game? Am I dreaming? Please confirm the scoreline :) If this is happening in real world, will you pass my message to Scholari to take moral responsibility & quit at half time? And.. You can take charge of Brazilian Team through Skype or something & restore order on the pitch. 43 mins: BBC commentator: “Joachim Low is strolling around his technical area like a man on a walk through a bluebell wood.” Yeah, that does sound pretty annoying. And German. Brazil have a freekick. The refereeing equivalent of the pity bunk-up. It comes to nowt. 41 mins: A rare chance for Brazil to get out of their own half as Oscar has a run at goal. Stopped by a brick wall of German. Loads and loads of emails coming in, we'll get to them at the half if that is okay. 39 mins: Ozil with a lovely run, it looks for a minute that Brazil are going to be assuming the position once again as Klose and Muller exchange passes, but Dante - he's in a circle of hell alright - manages to get a leg in the way. 37 mins: The Germans are massed on the edge of the Brazil box. Ozil, Kroos, Khedira and the rest all playing neat little passes, looking to slide the knife into the ribs again. Gustavo panics - they're all panicking, to be honest - and hauls down Muller. The Germans fight over the freekick like hyenas who've found an unattended extra large mighty meaty and it's Ozil who gets the chance. He scoops the ball harmlessly over. 36 mins: Poor Brazil. Nearly another hour of this to go. They really should hva a mercy rule. 34 mins: The inquest will go on for a while. At the moment, it is hard to know how to explain this. Brazil just so open. Where the hell are all their players? The Germans break again, four of them at high pace, lucky for Brazil the ball from Kroos (I think) is for once not to a man. 32 mins: Kroos with a shot, it hits Fernandinho in the chest, shades of handball I might add, but the Brazilians are spared that at least. The Germans surround the ref. Just a corner. GOAL! It's five. This is brutal to watch. It's like Brazil have been shot with tranquliser darts and Germany can just walk around them. The Germans nearly at walking pace on the edge of the box, Mesut Ozil and Miroslav Klose exchanging passes, Luiz the latest man to have a nightmare, and Khedira - who has been the main architect of this cathedral of destruction - now has a chance to get on the scoresheet with a clean strike of his own. Brazil 0 Germany 5 (Khedira 29) GOAL! Did I say that was a nightmare? THIS is a nightmare. It's four. Fernandinho has been caught in possession and Brazil have been opened up like a Kinder Egg. Kroos slots the ball home and it's four. Carnage. Brazil 0 Germany 4 (Kroos 26) GOAL! Oh my goodness. Ozil feeds Lahm, the ball comes across from the right. The Germans get a stroke of luck that they don't really need as Thomas Muller has an airshot... that means it just flies to Kroos unmarked at the edge of the box and he hits a hard, crisp, low sho. Three goals. Oh Brazil. This is nightmare. Brazil 0 Germany 3(Kroos 25) GOAL! Oh no. Oh dear. Miroslav Klose has made it two. A ball in from the right, Fernandinho tries to intercept but steps over it. Kroos plays it into the box and Muller makes a lovely little layoff-dummy. It falls to Klose, who hits his shot straight at the keeper. It rebounds straight to him though and Klose doesn't miss a second time. Klose has the all-time World Cup scoring record. Congrats. Brazil 0 Germany 2 (Klose 23) 20 mins: Klose holds it up, holds off his man and shoots at the keeper. I fear for Brazil here. They are so open. 18 mins: Brazil throwing the kitchen sink at the Germans, Marcelo now frees Oscar, who twists in the area and crosses. Just cut out. And the Germans look to break, they look seriously dangerous on the break. 16 mins: Oscar comes deep to pick up the ball and he's slid it through to Marcelo, who bursts into the box and goes down under a challenge from Lahm. It's a wonderful tackle, one of the best you will ever see. The Germans give Marcelo a rub-down for diving, there's a bit of shoving, and the ref steps in. Just a corner. Poor corner. 15 mins: Butch Oscar is the one who might be able to unpick this German defence. 14 mins: Now poor Hulk has hoofed the ball miles into touch. He looks like he would be a useful signing at inside centre, if any rugby union teams are watching. David Lander: With that goal Müller ties 1954 final hero Helmut Rahn on 10 world cuo goals. Rahn took 10 games, Müller a "slow" 12 games 13 mins: Brazil mount a series of spirited forrays in response, but the Germans are well organised, Brian, and they're well back and in numbers. Luiz starts a good counter but Hulk dallies too long on the ball. GOAL! GERMANY! Oh Brazil. Gutting. They've left Muller totally unmarked in the box, this is criminal defending, the winner of the Golden Boot in the last cup, the opposition's most lethal finisher... just left to his own devices near the back post to sidefoot the ball into the net. Shocker. "I would be embarrassed if I gave my opposite number that sort of space," says Martin Keown. Brazil 1 Germany 0 (Muller 11) 10 mins: Khedira's finding a lot space to break forward on the inside right cahnnel. He's won a corner. 9 mins: Open game, Muller putting Marcelo under big pressure, lucky for Brazil's dodgy full back the ref reckons the German fouled him. Nidhin writes: Hi I am Nidhin. I still believe Brazil will win today's match.....Brazilian supporter from India. 7 mins: Khedira opens Brazil up! Cross comes all the way across the area, dangerously, and Muller spots Khedira free in the area, he connects with a crisp drive that, luckily for Brazil, hits Toni Kroos in the badonkadonk. 5 mins: Hectic start, Brazil playing with drive and heart but not much composure. Big challenges from both teams in the centre. The first crunchy foul is not far away. 3 mins: Excellent surging start from Brazil, the crowd roaring them on, Luiz frees Hulk with a fine ball and Neuer has to look sharp to cut out the cross. Carlos asks: Can you ask Indra Beharry (just emailed you on the live blog) whether she knows Corporal Beharry that won a V.C. medal? I believe Corporal Beharry came from the Carribean. 2 mins: The Germans clear that, not after the ref has had a word with Fernandinho for trampling on the keeper's feet. Marcelo has a shot from distance, not too far wide. 1 mins: Here we go. The Germans kick off, but they have lost it quickly. The crowd roar. Fernandinho has won an early corner down the right. 20.59 And the Germans. 20.58 Here are the Brazil XI. 20.57 Still, wonderful performance of the anthem. 20.56 Brazil line up. David Luiz and Julio Cesar is holding up Neymar's shirt! Come off it. This is surely too much? He's not dead! Is he? He's not dead, right? 20.55 Germany's splendid national anthem. I think I hear a few whistles. Nothing like England fans 'welcoming' an opponent but a hostile atmosphere nonetheless. 20.52 Hope for Brazil's sake they've got another generous ref. If they go down to ten then the Germans will cut them apart. 20.46 An email from Indra Beharry. Hi Indra! Hi my name is Indra. I live in Trinidad and Tobago. I've been following the matches and am supporting Germany to win the cup. I love their style of play in my opinion they are the only team that shows team spirit and professionalism in their game They got discipline. And David Jane writes: I strongly believe that Germany is going to win this game and meet Netherland on the finals. 20.45 It's not hard to see why Gary has been universally acclaimed as British football's most insightful pundit. 20.42 So Bernard is the replacement for Neymar. A chance to shine for Bernard. The Day of the Bernard. Sorry. It's hard to take seriously. And I speak as an Alan, not exactly a cool name in its own right. 20.40 Heh. I enjoyed this from Manuel Lagos: This game has all the ingredients of an epic story. The Brazilians with their belief in God and the spirit world against the Germans and their belief in technology and the evil mythical machine God. The Federation vs The Borg. Humans vs Na'vi. Rocky vs Drago. Oh who will win? 20.37 BREAKING NEWS NEVER MIND THIS WORLD CUP RUBBISH: EVERTON HAVE SIGNED GARETH BARRY 20.34 Rio Ferdinand keeps it nice and simple. "They have lost their two best players. Can David Luiz come in and control that back four? And without Neymar, who can provide the flair?" Meanwhile, CZ writes: Germany should win based on the code of football. Their first choice is just to play. Not to injure. I have a really big suggestion for you. Do you think you can write an article and make some fuss about "line-technology "? Since we already have goal technology and proven to be a success , I think line tech is next. I have seen too many offsides called incorrectly and these calls really did affect the outcome. Some teams won and some lost just because of bad off side calling. Thanks! 20.34 C Alberto, obvs. 20.33 The images are so familiar, so beloved. I guarantee you will guess the goal from this terrible blurry grab. 20.30 Right then. Eyes down, look in. 20.24 Oh God they've all got Neymar caps on. 20.20 Refreshed and refuelled by some landfill-grade sushi, I am back. Readers, who is going to win this football match and why? I really need to know. 20.08 Anyway. Enough GCSE sociology. Who is playing in this football match? Brazil: Julio Cesar, Maicon, Dante, Luiz, Marcelo, Gustavo, Fernandinho, Hulk, Oscar, Bernard, Fred. Subs: Jefferson, Dani Alves, Paulinho, Maxwell, Henrique, Ramires, Hernanes, Willian, Jo, Victor. Germany: Neuer, Lahm, Boateng, Hummels, Howedes, Schweinsteiger, Khedira, Muller, Kroos, Ozil, Klose. Subs: Zieler, Grosskreutz, Ginter, Schurrle, Podolski, Draxler, Durm, Mertesacker, Gotze, Kramer, Weidenfeller. Referee: Marco Rodriguez (Mexico) 20.03 I guess it's hard to think of anything other than sport that could unite a huge developing nation. Actually, not a sport. A star sportsman. Actual sport is too unpredictable and complex. Loving a sportsman though, well that's an easy get for even the most socially excluded person. But my God the pressure and the weight of expectation and the unreasonable demands. Sachin Tendulkar might know how Neymar feels, but I bet there's not many others who do. Nobody in the West, I think. I mean, sure, Wayne Rooney is under pressure, but only the very saddest of the sad in England take it as seriously as all that. 20.00 I'm not saying "it's only a game." We're all far too into sport to say something that glib and shallow. But, you know, it is only a game. When you think of the corruption, the inequality, the poverty... and the huge pressure heaped on these young men to distract everyone from it. It's a wonder they don't all go quite mad. 19.58 This is the beef with Brazil, then, I think. This bit. "I will have my heart on the field to help these players and Neymar’s heart will be out there too." It all feels very overblown, almost unsustainably so, the hysteria and the hype. He's a footballer, a very good one, who has been injured and will miss the match. He's not dead. He's not crippled. He's not, also, living in a shack and being beat up by the police. The mania of Brazil, which we used to patronisingly go "Oh ho ho ho, samaba football, aren't they passionate, phwoar look at that girl in the bikini..." It feels somehow a bit slick now, a bit Disney, given all the problems in the country. Keep smiling and don't look at the poor people, Majesty. Bread and circuses, and all that. 19.55 Here is Paul Hayward's preview of the match. Brazil are trying to surf to the World Cup final on emotion. “I will have my heart on the field to help these players and Neymar’s heart will be out there too,” said Thiago Silva, the host nation’s captain whose appeal against suspension failed on the eve of their semi-final with Germany. Silva, who called Juan Camilo Zuniga’s challenge on Neymar in the Colombia game a “coward” tackle, will watch from the sidelines in Belo Horizonte but has seized the role of rabble rouser and cheerleader. “This is a derby in world football and everyone wants to watch this match,” he said. If Brazil’s fans seem overcome with feeling, try listening to the coaching staff and players. “We will not have Neymar but we have another 22 players who have been hand-picked because they are special,” said Luiz Felipe Scolari, Brazil’s coach. “I have a fantastic group of players. I’m sure that we are going to play for us, for Neymar, but also for the goal of reaching the final.” When Brazil score at this World Cup the noise from the fireworks is more sonic boom than bonfire night. The skies crash and shake. These turbo-pyrotechnics express not only the people’s love but an edge of aggression that also shows in the team’s increasingly robust play. 19.48 Are you of a betting persuasion? If you fancy Brazil to do it, they're generally around 10/11 to qualify and the Germans basically evens. To win in 90 minutes, the Brazils are 7/4 and Joachim Low's lot are about 2/1. The draw priced around 9/4. On Betfair it’s money back as a free bet if the match goes to Extra Time. All Semi-Final Games. All Customers. Selected Markets 19.46 An email from Nic. Germany look faster every time I watch them play. I do not think Brazil can keep up with them. On the other side, Argentina, with their "suspect" defense and "very average" team apart from Messi, have only given up three goals this tournament, two to a very athletic Nigeria. (Although I will concede that they have also scored the fewest goals of the teams remaining.) And while their final two games should indeed be their most challenging of the tournament, Lionel & Company continue to produce exactly what is needed. Argentina are the only squad remaining to win every game thus far (without needing a penalty shootout), and they have won each game by exactly one goal. From earlier, thank you for assuming the less dubious implication of "bracket", the word used in the USA for the tree diagram of a tournament's elimination stage -- to be filled out before the tournament and compared with those of one's peers for taunting, shaming and often betting purposes. I will be more judicious in my attempts to avoid cross-cultural perversions going forward. 19.45 In reply to the question above, "who will win tonight?", Ainar writes: I will give it to Germany. Very generous of you, Ainar. Wait. You're not like a match-fixing overlord or something? 19.40 Ha. On the subject of the Neymask... 19.32 The Telegraph's Alan Smith has here run the rule over the men who will likely be starting tonight. Do you agree with his assessment of the key match-ups? 19.30 So no Nemyar for Brazil. We'll talk about the sad and serious implications of that in a bit, I guess. But meanwhile... Here are the men who might replace him, via Project Babb. 19.28 Maybe I have just seen too many horror films. 19.27 Those Prince William and Kate oneswere pretty terrifying, too. 19.25 None more creepy than a sportsman mask. This is the worst I have seen since Andrew Flintoff. (Foreign chums - he was an England cricketer). I give you, with all apologies, THE NEYMASK. 19.20 Digging this stat. 19.15 An email arrives from Muhammad Waleed: Microsoft has had used a specially designed software which assess Teams' overall record and some other information to predict results, which astoundingly proved to be right. My recommendation would be to use any FIFA game and it would produce the same result at cheap cost. Lastly, My prediction is Germany. Doesn't sound as outrageous as those anticipating brazil's win? Funnily enough, Muhammad, we've had some of our top experts working on JUST SUCH A PROJECT. Here is our Digital World Cup, with Thom Gibbs and JJ Bull. 19.10 Telegraph star man Henry Winter has done a Google hangout, in which our Germany and Brazil columnists Randall Hauk (@odroku) and Allen Chahad (@allenchahad), preview the match, including the options open to head coach Luis Felipe Scolari and the threat posed by free-scoring Thomas Muller. Have a butcher's here. 19.00 Splendid stuff. And as if that were not enough, how about this. It's a team of David Luizs. Of David Luizes. Of David Luizi. Anyway. You know what I mean. Actually, you won't know what I mean until you click on its full magnificence. Check it out on our Project Babb website. Brazilian sports website Globo Esporte have found an ingenious way for the world’s office-workers to waste time before Brazil v Germany kicks off, by giving them the chance to add any face they like to the unique hairline of one David Luiz. Here’s our David Luiz XI. An attacking lineup, perhaps, but marshalled well by Roy Keane and, erm, David Luiz at the back, in front of the safe hands of (yes, indeed) Sideshow Bob. James Rodriguez’s attacking instincts at left-back would be complemented by Louise’s eternally defensive instincts on the right side of defence. Up front, a delighted-looking Wayne Rooney forms a formidable partnership with Lionel Messi and Robin van Persie. Here's a sneak peek of the horror that lies ahead once you click. Don't say I didn't warn you. 18.55 I have been trawling the highways and byways of the internet, so you don't have to, and here are some of the best pre-game things that I have found. First up, and this is quite splendid, it's the Manic Street Preachers hit song Motorcycle Emptiness with its lyrics changed to incorporate the names of various German players. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you.... Mertesacker Emptiness. 18.50 Our first email of the evening comes from Nic Chimenti, who says: If Germany and Argentina win today and tomorrow, I successfully picked the final game and should win my bracket. This proves, as always, that picking your bracket at the last minute without analyzing the teams always produces better results. I am assuming bracket is some sort of American betting thing rather than London slang for cocaine, but good luck to Nic in his venture. Who do you think is going to win? 18.45 Evening all. Alan Tyers here. And World Cup semi-finals here! How exciting. A fascinating match in store as Brazil take on Germany. If you'd asked most neutrals before the tournament who they would want to win a semi out of these two, the response would surely have been utterly one-sided: Brasiiiiiiillll. And yet, it feels as if something has changed, over this World Cup. The cliche of sex, sand, samba and soccer was already wearing a little thin, but this particular team's pragmatic, hard-tackling approach has surely blown that away for a generation. The likes of Paulinho, Fernandinho, Hulk and Thiago Silva seem more Stoke than Samba, and without Neymar, there aren't many in this team who you would put in anything like the class of previous wearers of the famous yellow shirt. Function has totally trumped finesse. But if you want to talk about cliches, how about the efficient Germans? It would be stretching a point to call them a loveable team, but the clever probing of Ozil, the glorious free-running of Muller and the passing of Kroos can be a delight to watch. Not saying they would be a popular winner tonight, but in terms of footballing merit they are, to this neutral at least, more deserving than Brazil. Estadio Mineirao, Belo Horizonte Kick-off: 21.00 BST TV: BBC ONE. Today Football Columnist Henry Winter, together with Germany and Brazil columnists Randall Hauk (@odroku) and Allen Chahad (@allenchahad), discussed the options open to head coach Luis Felipe Scolari and the threat posed by free-scoring Thomas Muller. And who they think will win the match. Emotions are running high in Minas Gerais. Will the ice-cool Teutons vanquish the hot-blooded samba kings? Team news Brazil (Possible, 4-2-3-1): Cesar; Maicon, Luiz, Dante, Marcelo; Gustavo, Fernandinho; Willian, Oscar, Hulk; Fred. Germany (Possible, 4-3-3): Neuer; Lahm, Hummels, Boateng, Höwedes; Khedira, Schweinsteiger, Kroos; Özil, Müller, Götze. Referee: Marco Rodríguez (Mexico). Joachim Loew expects his Germany side to face a battle against tough-tackling Brazil when football's titans clash in Tuesday's World Cup semi-final with the host nation desperate to win the title for injured superstar Neymar. Germany want to avenge their 2002 final defeat to Brazil by knocking the hosts out in Belo Horizonte to reach Sunday's final in Rio de Janeiro. Brazil's quest to win a sixth title on the home soil, meanwhile, has been dealt a huge blow as they will not only be missing top scorer Neymar, but also suspended captain Thiago Silva after his appeal against the booking he received in the quarter-final win over Colombia was rejected on Monday. Neymar suffered a fractured vertebra towards the end of his side's bruising 2-1 win over the Colombians on Friday. Brazil paid the price for their rough treatment handed out to James Rodriguez as Colombia met fire-with-fire before Juan Zuniga's challenge on Neymar left the Selecao star in hospital. The hosts committed a tournament high 31 fouls against their fellow South Americans and Loew is hoping Mexican referee Marco Rodriguez, who missed Luis Suarez's bite on Giorgio Chiellini early in the competition, doesn't allow the game to get out of hand. "I hope the referee Rodriguez will clamp down, because I have seen in the last few matches that Brazil's physical energy is going beyond of what we see in Europe," said Loew. "If the games had been played in Europe, none of the 22 players would have finished the matches." Brazil boss Luiz Felipe Scolari admitted his side's passage to the last four hadn't been in the image of his country's once famed 'Jogo Bonito' style, but insisted winning on home soil was the most important thing. "We are doing everything step-by-step, not always in the most beautiful way but we are getting closer to playing the final at home and so everything is as scheduled." And Scolari has urged his squad to use Neymar's absence as an extra motivating factor. "The way Neymar spoke to the players made them understand that he had done his share and now we need to do our share. "Myself, the other players, all the Brazilian people. This match is very important, it could take us to the final. "We are playing for our country, it is everything we imagined and dreamed of, and also for Neymar." Willian is one of the prime candidates to replace Neymar and the Chelsea midfielder insists Brazil still have the quality to overcome the Germans. "We know the quality that we have. We are all very sad at losing him but we are now even stronger after what happened and we can continue to pursue our dream." Remarkably for two World Cup powerhouses with 24 semi-final appearances between them, this will be just their second meeting in the competition after the 2002 final. "It's an honour and a challenge to play against the hosts, but it have would be better to play Brazil in the final," said German midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger. "It doesn't matter how much experience you have, to play the hosts in this football-crazy country is something special." With Silva suspended, Germany are expected to meet a familiar face in centre-back Dante, which could help both sides, according to his Bayern Munich team-mate Schweinsteiger. "I hope he starts, we know him very well and know his strengths and weaknesses, but he also knows how we play," said Schweinsteiger. Germany are desperate to end their 24-year wait for a fourth World Cup title, while Loew's side are determined to avoid a defeat which would mean the third-place play-off - for the third consecutive time. "I really do not need that, that's something I want to rule out," joked captain Philipp Lahm, who was on losing teams in semi-finals at the 2006 and 2010 World Cup finals.

Brazil vs Germany, World Cup 2014: as it happened - Telegraph	Henry Winter's match report: "This was an embarrassment to a famous shirt, a point their furious supporters made splenetically." Paul Hayward: "The indignity of this night will haunt Brazilian football for generations." Let's grab some of your views: Dave Stults, you have the honour: This World Cup has been full of so many shocking moments! If someone would have told me what would have happened in the Group Stages,Costa Rica's triumph, with Suarez, Neymar's injury, and now this catastrophe I wouldn't have believed it! Not for one second! What I don't understand is how Brazilian players could let this happen to them in Brazil! This surely must be the worst moment in Brazilian sport's history. David Luiz at the end of the match Here is Manish Joshi: Is Brazil trying to ensure james rodriguez/columbia doesn't get the golden boot...revenge for Neymar...??!! Sad way to go about it.. It breaks the heart that your sociology analysis is turning out so true...Hope the Brazillian taxpayer will raise questions rather than go about doing the samba...Something like that happened during Commonwealth games here in India..it started a cycle of questions that booted out the Indian National Congress, a 140 years old party, from its 10 year National government.. Chukwunenye Nnebe is one of the first to take a stab at the "why?" My take -- it all starts w/ the coach (Scolari) and then the players. From the 1st whistle of the WC opening match, Brazil has never played a cohesive and united game. Their lack of team play was evident in their close results up until the Germans exposed their weakness. No man-on-man marking, open field for the Germans after the 10th minute to play w/ the ball and get their passing game open, and the open look at the goal ended up in the final result! I've never seen a lackluster and indisciplined effort from the Brazilian players... they were truly an embarassing team to be fielded. No midfield player, no wingers, no creative ball passing, or tactical running... surely, Kaka and Robinho would have brought a difference to the midfield and the attacking forward play. Scolari stumbles AGAIN! Nick Bishop has a dibble: Germany have played exceptionally well and with style, yet they have such a well drilled functionality that they will exploit any weaknesses. Brazil lacked a captain, any urgency or ambition. At 0 3, they were gone and punch drunk. Such was the precision and ruthlessness of the Germans that we were provided a freak scoreline against an insipid team lacking any leaders. Old skool vidiprinter shout-out Here's Søren H. Assmann: Germany is still in shock. Shock and awe. I still wish to hug all those crying Brazilian fans, they can't help it that their team just went tactically for all-out offense against the best counter break team on this planet. Some records: Klose's 16th World Cup goal, all-time record. Germany 222 World Cup goals, now two ahead of Brazil for most goals at World Cups. The 1:0 by Müller was the 2000th goal of the Deutscher Fussball-Bund (DFB) international football game history. And if the scoreline stands, it's the highest defeat of any team in a World Cup semifinal. And the highest defeat for Brazil ever. Brian Doyle had the solution: At 3 nil someone, anyone, ideally the captain, on the Brazil squad should have quickly grabbed his team mates threatened them all and then told them to calm down and regroup. Chapeau to snapper Laurence Griffiths But I think we will give the last word to Karla, who says: Oh my god. This is unbelievable! As a German myself I should probably be more happy about my team winning this game... but.. I'm utterly gobsmacked -- a win really shouldn't feel this bad, should it? This is like watching a train wreck. But well. We're winning...so. I guess: Yay? Hm.. 90+ mins: No futher misery, the referee finally stops the fight. GOAL! Hey! Not so bad! Brazil have a goal. A breakway, for once Germany don't get back in time, and for once the Brazilian forwards show some composure. Oscar is the man who slots it home, good finish. Brazil 1 Germany 7 (Oscar 90) 88 mins: Germany should have had eight, Ozil sent racing clear but he drags his shot just wide. Jonathan Rodriguez: My name is Jonathan Rodriguez and: this is what revenge feels like! When Brazil beat Germany in their home world cup. This is what revenge should look like, as anything but pleasant. 87 mins: Some of these are career low performances. Hulk, the poor bloke is a laughing stock. Ditto Fred. Luiz, well all the bad bits have been in full effect. Marcelo probably the worst of the lot, just wandering up the left wing, missing from his post time and again. In the time it's taken me to type that, he has lost the ball 30 yards from goal and luckily for him Schurrle fails with the cross. And now Marcelo has gone missing and let Lahm in. Literally, two separate horrible mistakes in ten seconds. Bernard has shot wildly over. 85 mins: Good move from Brazil ends with Ramires shooting from outside the box. 84 mins: Brazil playing well in fits and starts. Sounds like John Thiongo is just going to give Russia 2016 a miss altogether. Very sad for Brazil. I sympathize with the Brazilian people because they had high hopes of their team. See you in Qatar 80 mins: Paulinho knocks it down for Marcelo, who shoots a couple of yards wide. Neuer rushes to get the ball to restart. Steady on old chap. "Neuer is programmed to win," says Martin Keown. That was Ivan Drago, wasn't it Martin? Brazil fans now applauding that goal. Whatever gets you through the night at this stage. Robert: Let's get some perspective here, even England beat Brazil in their last friendly. GOAL! Nope. That is the best goal yet. Surging run down the left, inside to Schurrle and he has lashed it home with a magnificent finish. Brazil 0 Germany 7 (Schurrle 79) 76 mins: Marcelo gives it away cheaply. Handbags between Luiz and Muller, the Brazil man looks like he's losing the rag. Red card for the captain would be a fitting final indignity. Ref chills everyone down. Michelle Mcmahon: Germany needs to remember they are guests and have some manners. No more! On the other hand...The German (Shepherd) I live with is strutting. Annoying. Typical. German. He's winning his predictions. 75 mins: Several minutes have elapsed without the Germans scoring, the big losers, so they bring on Julian Draxler - who always sounds like a techno DJ to me. This the musical equivalent of nosebleed gabber at 11am in a Rotterdam shipping container yard. for the Brazil players/fans. The super Khedira is the man who goes off. 70 mins: As to David's question, Brazil's attack has totally sucked, like their defence. I guess that the defensive mistakes are more glaring. 69 mins: Big Phil puts Fred out of his misery, not a green tent job fortunately, but takes him off and brings on Willian. The crowd boo Fred off. Now they boo Fred every time the camera picks him out sitting on the bench. Harsh. David: Alan would you agree that with the terrible defending by Brazil perhaps Thiago Silva is a bigger loss than Neymar? GOAL! Best goal of the lot I think. So patient, so clinical from Germany. Khedira the creator, he plays it into Lahm, who has surged forward up the right. Skipper has the composure to pick out a man in the box and it's Schurrle who has time to place the shot past the keeper. So many of the finishes have been so calm, made to look so easy. Nobody has had to do anything much to take his goal, the Brazil defence just being so out of position. Brazil 0 Germany 6 (Schurrle 69) 68 mins: Dante the first man in the book. 67 mins: Fred has what looks like a brilliant chance but he is off-side. 66 mins: Scheweinsteiger with a raking ball, excellent save from Cesar to cut it out before Schurrle can nick it. 64 mins: Muller, what a player this boy is, down the left, opening Brazil up on the break, crosses and that's only an inch away from finding the free and fabulous Schurrle. Andrew Holgate: In 1954 Austria came from 3-0 down to win 7-5 vs Switzerland, while England and Belgium shared a 4-4 draw. Both record games (goals scored in one game, biggest deficit to win, highest score draw). 63 mins: Maicon reckons he has been brought down in the box. The Germans reckon Maicon should have a yellow for diving. 61 mins: And now Khedira and Muller link up well, the latter curling a fine shot at goal. Excellent save. Juan Carlos Gonzalez-Najera: It's pointless to bring it up now, but again, why is Fred in this team? Surely he cannot be among the best Brazilian attackers in the world? Because if he is, Brazil has a very long road to travel before they can come back for the next cup. 60 mins: Normal service has been resumed, Muller skips around the keeper and that's a heroic dive by Cesar to nick the ball off him. 58 mins: Another chance for Brazil, playing pretty well now, but sadly it falls to Fred who, well, you can guess the rest. Wrong Said Fred. 57 mins: Klose comes off. Not a bad hour's work. Schurrle on Robert Stewart: At current rate of progress Brazil will come fifth in the third place play-off. On a more serious note one cannot help but feel sorry for the Brazilians who have ended up paying for the extravaganza. Let's hope they redeem some pride. 55 mins: Brazil all over the Germans right now. Muller having a magnificent game at front and now back as well, charging back and hurling himself into important tackles. Thulisani: Good Lord, I didnt think missin Neymar wld take Brazil so out of it, I too wish they cld just throw in the towel(s). Funny too earlier today I read an article on 5 reasons why Germany will will, well maybe there is saving face for Brasil coz there was 3reasons they cld hold off Germany too. 53 mins: Paulinho! The sloppy Germans are all over the place, disgraceful, they'll be wanting to raise their game here or, well, they'll only win eight nil. Lofted ball over to Paulinho on the left, he's got time and space. He has to score. He hits it straight at the keeper. Comes back at him but he fails with the follow-up as well. Neuer with the double save. Lamas: I wanted Brazil punished, but not this bad. At least it won't get as bad Australia vs American Samoa. Right? 52 mins: Oh dear. Oh Brazil. They should have scored. Oscar at the fore, they've opened up the Germans and here's Fred with the chance! He just sort of tumbles over, like a sad and dying tree. Jean Sullivan: As a neutral for this match, it is still a nightmare. And just when you want to say that Germany has deserved this blow-out they seem to be thinking it’s fine to push Brazil players over at will. Is there such a thing as a clean game at this stage? 50 mins: Brazil play their best stuff of the match, and Ramires gets to the byline, that's a good effort by Neuer to cut out the cross. Sai: Oh My Gosh!!! I've refreshed my browser after I saw scoreboard changing from Brazil 0 -2 Germany to Brazil 0 -4 Germany. Few minutes later when I saw Brazil 0 -5 Germany, I thought there might virus/spam attack on my browser. I'm in the office on the west coast of USA -I do not know if Germany is prudent or if Brazil is lackadaisical today. 48 mins: Decent start from Brazil, Maicon wit the ball in, Oscar into the box, tries to dink it over the German defender and just runs into him. Ref not buying the penalty claim. 46 mins: Some subs. Fernandinho is the lucky man to be taken off. Paulinho can have a dose. The hapless Hulk comes off for Ramires. For the Germans, Hummels gets a rest and Mertesacker gets his chance. 21.01 Bad news for Brazil fans: the second half is beginning. 22.00 Betting man/woman? Our betting expert Barry writes: "HT in Belo Horizonte and – didn’t think I’d be writing this – in the correct score betting on Betfair six nil Germany is just 4/1, while 7-0 is 9/1" 21.59 Couple more emails. Helle Adamsen You may go all German tonight!!!!!! I just feel sorry for the ordinary Brazilian people who have paid for this extravanza - where has the original Brazilian football gone off to? But give Angela Merkel and her German team a little credit - they reign supreme in Europe!! Sad - maybe, but nice to see Europe still have a touch. I bet the humiliation will be total by the end of the match, but will feel sorry for the Brazilian population, they deserved something better. Anna says: "We are as astonished as you are...they just panicked!! What a shame! Can they go home now?? 21.57 This picture from our German football blogger Randall Hauk HALF TIME BRAZIL 0 GERMANY 5 (AND YES THAT'S FIVE GOALS) Not sure I've seen anything like that. Khedira the pick, a lot of the Germans very good but wow. Brazil. Just utterly awful, so slow, so disorganised, so confused. Feel genuinely sorry for them. Who better than Alan Hansen to assess this defensive misery? "In the annals of time there has never been a game like this, a humiliation like this. It is about four levels below rock bottom. It is embarrassing. David Luiz is the captain and he has abandoned ship. Someone had to hold this unit together and he has gone missing." Oh, Bernard. Let's grab some emails - thanks for writing sorry it's taken a while to get them up. Daniel Forlines: "Don't think Brazil has what it takes to get it done, especially after seeing Muller in the box, WIDE OPEN. Haven't seen a Germany W in the Cup since I was 3. It's overdue!" Tony Gill: "5-0 at the half. Who do you think will be taking the penalties later on?" Andy: "Scotland, it's just like watching Scotland..." And here is Kiran Kulkarni: Is this a joke? Am I watching a Football match being played at Estádio Mineirão, Belo Horizonte or is this a video footage from Playstation? It's 2 am here in India! Am I watching a live football game? Am I dreaming? Please confirm the scoreline :) If this is happening in real world, will you pass my message to Scholari to take moral responsibility & quit at half time? And.. You can take charge of Brazilian Team through Skype or something & restore order on the pitch. 43 mins: BBC commentator: “Joachim Low is strolling around his technical area like a man on a walk through a bluebell wood.” Yeah, that does sound pretty annoying. And German. Brazil have a freekick. The refereeing equivalent of the pity bunk-up. It comes to nowt. 41 mins: A rare chance for Brazil to get out of their own half as Oscar has a run at goal. Stopped by a brick wall of German. Loads and loads of emails coming in, we'll get to them at the half if that is okay. 39 mins: Ozil with a lovely run, it looks for a minute that Brazil are going to be assuming the position once again as Klose and Muller exchange passes, but Dante - he's in a circle of hell alright - manages to get a leg in the way. 37 mins: The Germans are massed on the edge of the Brazil box. Ozil, Kroos, Khedira and the rest all playing neat little passes, looking to slide the knife into the ribs again. Gustavo panics - they're all panicking, to be honest - and hauls down Muller. The Germans fight over the freekick like hyenas who've found an unattended extra large mighty meaty and it's Ozil who gets the chance. He scoops the ball harmlessly over. 36 mins: Poor Brazil. Nearly another hour of this to go. They really should hva a mercy rule. 34 mins: The inquest will go on for a while. At the moment, it is hard to know how to explain this. Brazil just so open. Where the hell are all their players? The Germans break again, four of them at high pace, lucky for Brazil the ball from Kroos (I think) is for once not to a man. 32 mins: Kroos with a shot, it hits Fernandinho in the chest, shades of handball I might add, but the Brazilians are spared that at least. The Germans surround the ref. Just a corner. GOAL! It's five. This is brutal to watch. It's like Brazil have been shot with tranquliser darts and Germany can just walk around them. The Germans nearly at walking pace on the edge of the box, Mesut Ozil and Miroslav Klose exchanging passes, Luiz the latest man to have a nightmare, and Khedira - who has been the main architect of this cathedral of destruction - now has a chance to get on the scoresheet with a clean strike of his own. Brazil 0 Germany 5 (Khedira 29) GOAL! Did I say that was a nightmare? THIS is a nightmare. It's four. Fernandinho has been caught in possession and Brazil have been opened up like a Kinder Egg. Kroos slots the ball home and it's four. Carnage. Brazil 0 Germany 4 (Kroos 26) GOAL! Oh my goodness. Ozil feeds Lahm, the ball comes across from the right. The Germans get a stroke of luck that they don't really need as Thomas Muller has an airshot... that means it just flies to Kroos unmarked at the edge of the box and he hits a hard, crisp, low sho. Three goals. Oh Brazil. This is nightmare. Brazil 0 Germany 3(Kroos 25) GOAL! Oh no. Oh dear. Miroslav Klose has made it two. A ball in from the right, Fernandinho tries to intercept but steps over it. Kroos plays it into the box and Muller makes a lovely little layoff-dummy. It falls to Klose, who hits his shot straight at the keeper. It rebounds straight to him though and Klose doesn't miss a second time. Klose has the all-time World Cup scoring record. Congrats. Brazil 0 Germany 2 (Klose 23) 20 mins: Klose holds it up, holds off his man and shoots at the keeper. I fear for Brazil here. They are so open. 18 mins: Brazil throwing the kitchen sink at the Germans, Marcelo now frees Oscar, who twists in the area and crosses. Just cut out. And the Germans look to break, they look seriously dangerous on the break. 16 mins: Oscar comes deep to pick up the ball and he's slid it through to Marcelo, who bursts into the box and goes down under a challenge from Lahm. It's a wonderful tackle, one of the best you will ever see. The Germans give Marcelo a rub-down for diving, there's a bit of shoving, and the ref steps in. Just a corner. Poor corner. 15 mins: Butch Oscar is the one who might be able to unpick this German defence. 14 mins: Now poor Hulk has hoofed the ball miles into touch. He looks like he would be a useful signing at inside centre, if any rugby union teams are watching. David Lander: With that goal Müller ties 1954 final hero Helmut Rahn on 10 world cuo goals. Rahn took 10 games, Müller a "slow" 12 games 13 mins: Brazil mount a series of spirited forrays in response, but the Germans are well organised, Brian, and they're well back and in numbers. Luiz starts a good counter but Hulk dallies too long on the ball. GOAL! GERMANY! Oh Brazil. Gutting. They've left Muller totally unmarked in the box, this is criminal defending, the winner of the Golden Boot in the last cup, the opposition's most lethal finisher... just left to his own devices near the back post to sidefoot the ball into the net. Shocker. "I would be embarrassed if I gave my opposite number that sort of space," says Martin Keown. Brazil 1 Germany 0 (Muller 11) 10 mins: Khedira's finding a lot space to break forward on the inside right cahnnel. He's won a corner. 9 mins: Open game, Muller putting Marcelo under big pressure, lucky for Brazil's dodgy full back the ref reckons the German fouled him. Nidhin writes: Hi I am Nidhin. I still believe Brazil will win today's match.....Brazilian supporter from India. 7 mins: Khedira opens Brazil up! Cross comes all the way across the area, dangerously, and Muller spots Khedira free in the area, he connects with a crisp drive that, luckily for Brazil, hits Toni Kroos in the badonkadonk. 5 mins: Hectic start, Brazil playing with drive and heart but not much composure. Big challenges from both teams in the centre. The first crunchy foul is not far away. 3 mins: Excellent surging start from Brazil, the crowd roaring them on, Luiz frees Hulk with a fine ball and Neuer has to look sharp to cut out the cross. Carlos asks: Can you ask Indra Beharry (just emailed you on the live blog) whether she knows Corporal Beharry that won a V.C. medal? I believe Corporal Beharry came from the Carribean. 2 mins: The Germans clear that, not after the ref has had a word with Fernandinho for trampling on the keeper's feet. Marcelo has a shot from distance, not too far wide. 1 mins: Here we go. The Germans kick off, but they have lost it quickly. The crowd roar. Fernandinho has won an early corner down the right. 20.59 And the Germans. 20.58 Here are the Brazil XI. 20.57 Still, wonderful performance of the anthem. 20.56 Brazil line up. David Luiz and Julio Cesar is holding up Neymar's shirt! Come off it. This is surely too much? He's not dead! Is he? He's not dead, right? 20.55 Germany's splendid national anthem. I think I hear a few whistles. Nothing like England fans 'welcoming' an opponent but a hostile atmosphere nonetheless. 20.52 Hope for Brazil's sake they've got another generous ref. If they go down to ten then the Germans will cut them apart. 20.46 An email from Indra Beharry. Hi Indra! Hi my name is Indra. I live in Trinidad and Tobago. I've been following the matches and am supporting Germany to win the cup. I love their style of play in my opinion they are the only team that shows team spirit and professionalism in their game They got discipline. And David Jane writes: I strongly believe that Germany is going to win this game and meet Netherland on the finals. 20.45 It's not hard to see why Gary has been universally acclaimed as British football's most insightful pundit. 20.42 So Bernard is the replacement for Neymar. A chance to shine for Bernard. The Day of the Bernard. Sorry. It's hard to take seriously. And I speak as an Alan, not exactly a cool name in its own right. 20.40 Heh. I enjoyed this from Manuel Lagos: This game has all the ingredients of an epic story. The Brazilians with their belief in God and the spirit world against the Germans and their belief in technology and the evil mythical machine God. The Federation vs The Borg. Humans vs Na'vi. Rocky vs Drago. Oh who will win? 20.37 BREAKING NEWS NEVER MIND THIS WORLD CUP RUBBISH: EVERTON HAVE SIGNED GARETH BARRY 20.34 Rio Ferdinand keeps it nice and simple. "They have lost their two best players. Can David Luiz come in and control that back four? And without Neymar, who can provide the flair?" Meanwhile, CZ writes: Germany should win based on the code of football. Their first choice is just to play. Not to injure. I have a really big suggestion for you. Do you think you can write an article and make some fuss about "line-technology "? Since we already have goal technology and proven to be a success , I think line tech is next. I have seen too many offsides called incorrectly and these calls really did affect the outcome. Some teams won and some lost just because of bad off side calling. Thanks! 20.34 C Alberto, obvs. 20.33 The images are so familiar, so beloved. I guarantee you will guess the goal from this terrible blurry grab. 20.30 Right then. Eyes down, look in. 20.24 Oh God they've all got Neymar caps on. 20.20 Refreshed and refuelled by some landfill-grade sushi, I am back. Readers, who is going to win this football match and why? I really need to know. 20.08 Anyway. Enough GCSE sociology. Who is playing in this football match? Brazil: Julio Cesar, Maicon, Dante, Luiz, Marcelo, Gustavo, Fernandinho, Hulk, Oscar, Bernard, Fred. Subs: Jefferson, Dani Alves, Paulinho, Maxwell, Henrique, Ramires, Hernanes, Willian, Jo, Victor. Germany: Neuer, Lahm, Boateng, Hummels, Howedes, Schweinsteiger, Khedira, Muller, Kroos, Ozil, Klose. Subs: Zieler, Grosskreutz, Ginter, Schurrle, Podolski, Draxler, Durm, Mertesacker, Gotze, Kramer, Weidenfeller. Referee: Marco Rodriguez (Mexico) 20.03 I guess it's hard to think of anything other than sport that could unite a huge developing nation. Actually, not a sport. A star sportsman. Actual sport is too unpredictable and complex. Loving a sportsman though, well that's an easy get for even the most socially excluded person. But my God the pressure and the weight of expectation and the unreasonable demands. Sachin Tendulkar might know how Neymar feels, but I bet there's not many others who do. Nobody in the West, I think. I mean, sure, Wayne Rooney is under pressure, but only the very saddest of the sad in England take it as seriously as all that. 20.00 I'm not saying "it's only a game." We're all far too into sport to say something that glib and shallow. But, you know, it is only a game. When you think of the corruption, the inequality, the poverty... and the huge pressure heaped on these young men to distract everyone from it. It's a wonder they don't all go quite mad. 19.58 This is the beef with Brazil, then, I think. This bit. "I will have my heart on the field to help these players and Neymar’s heart will be out there too." It all feels very overblown, almost unsustainably so, the hysteria and the hype. He's a footballer, a very good one, who has been injured and will miss the match. He's not dead. He's not crippled. He's not, also, living in a shack and being beat up by the police. The mania of Brazil, which we used to patronisingly go "Oh ho ho ho, samaba football, aren't they passionate, phwoar look at that girl in the bikini..." It feels somehow a bit slick now, a bit Disney, given all the problems in the country. Keep smiling and don't look at the poor people, Majesty. Bread and circuses, and all that. 19.55 Here is Paul Hayward's preview of the match. Brazil are trying to surf to the World Cup final on emotion. “I will have my heart on the field to help these players and Neymar’s heart will be out there too,” said Thiago Silva, the host nation’s captain whose appeal against suspension failed on the eve of their semi-final with Germany. Silva, who called Juan Camilo Zuniga’s challenge on Neymar in the Colombia game a “coward” tackle, will watch from the sidelines in Belo Horizonte but has seized the role of rabble rouser and cheerleader. “This is a derby in world football and everyone wants to watch this match,” he said. If Brazil’s fans seem overcome with feeling, try listening to the coaching staff and players. “We will not have Neymar but we have another 22 players who have been hand-picked because they are special,” said Luiz Felipe Scolari, Brazil’s coach. “I have a fantastic group of players. I’m sure that we are going to play for us, for Neymar, but also for the goal of reaching the final.” When Brazil score at this World Cup the noise from the fireworks is more sonic boom than bonfire night. The skies crash and shake. These turbo-pyrotechnics express not only the people’s love but an edge of aggression that also shows in the team’s increasingly robust play. 19.48 Are you of a betting persuasion? If you fancy Brazil to do it, they're generally around 10/11 to qualify and the Germans basically evens. To win in 90 minutes, the Brazils are 7/4 and Joachim Low's lot are about 2/1. The draw priced around 9/4. On Betfair it’s money back as a free bet if the match goes to Extra Time. All Semi-Final Games. All Customers. Selected Markets 19.46 An email from Nic. Germany look faster every time I watch them play. I do not think Brazil can keep up with them. On the other side, Argentina, with their "suspect" defense and "very average" team apart from Messi, have only given up three goals this tournament, two to a very athletic Nigeria. (Although I will concede that they have also scored the fewest goals of the teams remaining.) And while their final two games should indeed be their most challenging of the tournament, Lionel & Company continue to produce exactly what is needed. Argentina are the only squad remaining to win every game thus far (without needing a penalty shootout), and they have won each game by exactly one goal. From earlier, thank you for assuming the less dubious implication of "bracket", the word used in the USA for the tree diagram of a tournament's elimination stage -- to be filled out before the tournament and compared with those of one's peers for taunting, shaming and often betting purposes. I will be more judicious in my attempts to avoid cross-cultural perversions going forward. 19.45 In reply to the question above, "who will win tonight?", Ainar writes: I will give it to Germany. Very generous of you, Ainar. Wait. You're not like a match-fixing overlord or something? 19.40 Ha. On the subject of the Neymask... 19.32 The Telegraph's Alan Smith has here run the rule over the men who will likely be starting tonight. Do you agree with his assessment of the key match-ups? 19.30 So no Nemyar for Brazil. We'll talk about the sad and serious implications of that in a bit, I guess. But meanwhile... Here are the men who might replace him, via Project Babb. 19.28 Maybe I have just seen too many horror films. 19.27 Those Prince William and Kate oneswere pretty terrifying, too. 19.25 None more creepy than a sportsman mask. This is the worst I have seen since Andrew Flintoff. (Foreign chums - he was an England cricketer). I give you, with all apologies, THE NEYMASK. 19.20 Digging this stat. 19.15 An email arrives from Muhammad Waleed: Microsoft has had used a specially designed software which assess Teams' overall record and some other information to predict results, which astoundingly proved to be right. My recommendation would be to use any FIFA game and it would produce the same result at cheap cost. Lastly, My prediction is Germany. Doesn't sound as outrageous as those anticipating brazil's win? Funnily enough, Muhammad, we've had some of our top experts working on JUST SUCH A PROJECT. Here is our Digital World Cup, with Thom Gibbs and JJ Bull. 19.10 Telegraph star man Henry Winter has done a Google hangout, in which our Germany and Brazil columnists Randall Hauk (@odroku) and Allen Chahad (@allenchahad), preview the match, including the options open to head coach Luis Felipe Scolari and the threat posed by free-scoring Thomas Muller. Have a butcher's here. 19.00 Splendid stuff. And as if that were not enough, how about this. It's a team of David Luizs. Of David Luizes. Of David Luizi. Anyway. You know what I mean. Actually, you won't know what I mean until you click on its full magnificence. Check it out on our Project Babb website. Brazilian sports website Globo Esporte have found an ingenious way for the world’s office-workers to waste time before Brazil v Germany kicks off, by giving them the chance to add any face they like to the unique hairline of one David Luiz. Here’s our David Luiz XI. An attacking lineup, perhaps, but marshalled well by Roy Keane and, erm, David Luiz at the back, in front of the safe hands of (yes, indeed) Sideshow Bob. James Rodriguez’s attacking instincts at left-back would be complemented by Louise’s eternally defensive instincts on the right side of defence. Up front, a delighted-looking Wayne Rooney forms a formidable partnership with Lionel Messi and Robin van Persie. Here's a sneak peek of the horror that lies ahead once you click. Don't say I didn't warn you. 18.55 I have been trawling the highways and byways of the internet, so you don't have to, and here are some of the best pre-game things that I have found. First up, and this is quite splendid, it's the Manic Street Preachers hit song Motorcycle Emptiness with its lyrics changed to incorporate the names of various German players. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you.... Mertesacker Emptiness. 18.50 Our first email of the evening comes from Nic Chimenti, who says: If Germany and Argentina win today and tomorrow, I successfully picked the final game and should win my bracket. This proves, as always, that picking your bracket at the last minute without analyzing the teams always produces better results. I am assuming bracket is some sort of American betting thing rather than London slang for cocaine, but good luck to Nic in his venture. Who do you think is going to win? 18.45 Evening all. Alan Tyers here. And World Cup semi-finals here! How exciting. A fascinating match in store as Brazil take on Germany. If you'd asked most neutrals before the tournament who they would want to win a semi out of these two, the response would surely have been utterly one-sided: Brasiiiiiiillll. And yet, it feels as if something has changed, over this World Cup. The cliche of sex, sand, samba and soccer was already wearing a little thin, but this particular team's pragmatic, hard-tackling approach has surely blown that away for a generation. The likes of Paulinho, Fernandinho, Hulk and Thiago Silva seem more Stoke than Samba, and without Neymar, there aren't many in this team who you would put in anything like the class of previous wearers of the famous yellow shirt. Function has totally trumped finesse. But if you want to talk about cliches, how about the efficient Germans? It would be stretching a point to call them a loveable team, but the clever probing of Ozil, the glorious free-running of Muller and the passing of Kroos can be a delight to watch. Not saying they would be a popular winner tonight, but in terms of footballing merit they are, to this neutral at least, more deserving than Brazil. Estadio Mineirao, Belo Horizonte Kick-off: 21.00 BST TV: BBC ONE. Today Football Columnist Henry Winter, together with Germany and Brazil columnists Randall Hauk (@odroku) and Allen Chahad (@allenchahad), discussed the options open to head coach Luis Felipe Scolari and the threat posed by free-scoring Thomas Muller. And who they think will win the match. Emotions are running high in Minas Gerais. Will the ice-cool Teutons vanquish the hot-blooded samba kings? Team news Brazil (Possible, 4-2-3-1): Cesar; Maicon, Luiz, Dante, Marcelo; Gustavo, Fernandinho; Willian, Oscar, Hulk; Fred. Germany (Possible, 4-3-3): Neuer; Lahm, Hummels, Boateng, Höwedes; Khedira, Schweinsteiger, Kroos; Özil, Müller, Götze. Referee: Marco Rodríguez (Mexico). Joachim Loew expects his Germany side to face a battle against tough-tackling Brazil when football's titans clash in Tuesday's World Cup semi-final with the host nation desperate to win the title for injured superstar Neymar. Germany want to avenge their 2002 final defeat to Brazil by knocking the hosts out in Belo Horizonte to reach Sunday's final in Rio de Janeiro. Brazil's quest to win a sixth title on the home soil, meanwhile, has been dealt a huge blow as they will not only be missing top scorer Neymar, but also suspended captain Thiago Silva after his appeal against the booking he received in the quarter-final win over Colombia was rejected on Monday. Neymar suffered a fractured vertebra towards the end of his side's bruising 2-1 win over the Colombians on Friday. Brazil paid the price for their rough treatment handed out to James Rodriguez as Colombia met fire-with-fire before Juan Zuniga's challenge on Neymar left the Selecao star in hospital. The hosts committed a tournament high 31 fouls against their fellow South Americans and Loew is hoping Mexican referee Marco Rodriguez, who missed Luis Suarez's bite on Giorgio Chiellini early in the competition, doesn't allow the game to get out of hand. "I hope the referee Rodriguez will clamp down, because I have seen in the last few matches that Brazil's physical energy is going beyond of what we see in Europe," said Loew. "If the games had been played in Europe, none of the 22 players would have finished the matches." Brazil boss Luiz Felipe Scolari admitted his side's passage to the last four hadn't been in the image of his country's once famed 'Jogo Bonito' style, but insisted winning on home soil was the most important thing. "We are doing everything step-by-step, not always in the most beautiful way but we are getting closer to playing the final at home and so everything is as scheduled." And Scolari has urged his squad to use Neymar's absence as an extra motivating factor. "The way Neymar spoke to the players made them understand that he had done his share and now we need to do our share. "Myself, the other players, all the Brazilian people. This match is very important, it could take us to the final. "We are playing for our country, it is everything we imagined and dreamed of, and also for Neymar." Willian is one of the prime candidates to replace Neymar and the Chelsea midfielder insists Brazil still have the quality to overcome the Germans. "We know the quality that we have. We are all very sad at losing him but we are now even stronger after what happened and we can continue to pursue our dream." Remarkably for two World Cup powerhouses with 24 semi-final appearances between them, this will be just their second meeting in the competition after the 2002 final. "It's an honour and a challenge to play against the hosts, but it have would be better to play Brazil in the final," said German midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger. "It doesn't matter how much experience you have, to play the hosts in this football-crazy country is something special." With Silva suspended, Germany are expected to meet a familiar face in centre-back Dante, which could help both sides, according to his Bayern Munich team-mate Schweinsteiger. "I hope he starts, we know him very well and know his strengths and weaknesses, but he also knows how we play," said Schweinsteiger. Germany are desperate to end their 24-year wait for a fourth World Cup title, while Loew's side are determined to avoid a defeat which would mean the third-place play-off - for the third consecutive time. "I really do not need that, that's something I want to rule out," joked captain Philipp Lahm, who was on losing teams in semi-finals at the 2006 and 2010 World Cup finals.

World Cup 2014: Premier League players fail to make Fifa / Castrol Index team of the tournament so far - Telegraph	There have been some impressive displays in between the sticks over the past month, but Claudio Bravo, the Chilean goalkeeper, is apparently the No1 No1, with a 9.26 Castrol Index rating. Earlier in the tournament the 31-year-old's £9.7-million move to Barcelona from Real Sociedad was announced. The rest of the team are largely made up of Real Madrid and Bayern Munich players. French defender Raphaël Varane, 21, has been selected at right-back after scoring an average score of 9.7, and his Spanish club team-mates in the Castrol Index side include Angel di Maria (9.46) and Karim Benzema (9.79). Representatives from Bayern include Xherdan Shaquri (9.32), Toni Kroos (9.28) and Arjen Robben (9.59) – though there is no place for four-goal Thomas Müller. Paris St Germain have two players in the Castrol Index XI, with Brazilians Thiago Silva (9.66) and David Luiz (9.56) – selected at left-back – making the grade. There is also space for James Rodríguez (9.74), the Colombian playmaker who is currently the tournament's top scorer with six, and speculation is rife that he will soon move from Monaco to Real Madrid. And Mats Hummels, the Borussia Dortmund centre-back, makes the side, scoring 9.63. In actual fact, the top-rated Premier League player in the Castrol Index is 10th-placed Jan Vertonghen. The Tottenham full-back has impressed for Belgium, especially when rampaging forward, but his 9.48 rating is not enough to make the final XI. Manchester United striker Robin van Persie is the next highest Premier League performer (9.26), in 20th, followed by Vincent Kompany (27th with 9.14) and Mesut Ozil (29th with 9.1)	sports

West Ham test waters with £9.5m move for Ukraine international Yevhen Konoplyanka - Telegraph	Dnipro are likely to insist that Konoplyanka’s buy-out clause is met before giving permission to Sullivan and Gold to open negotiations with the player. Konoplyanka looked set to move to Anfield during the January transfer window after Liverpool agreed to meet the winger’s release clause, but multi-millionaire Kolomoyskyi refused to sign the necessary paperwork. The actions of Kolomoyski put Liverpool off reviving their interest in Konoplyanka this summer and the Anfield club have since signed Adam Lallana and Lazar Markovic. West Ham’s London rivals Tottenham also bid for Konoplyanka in January, but Spurs are yet to show any sign of making a renewed offer. Konoplyanka wants to move to England this summer and West Ham will attempt to convince the 24-year-old they can match his ambition if they can agree a fee with Dnipro. In September 2012, Konoplyanka scored a long-rage goal for Ukraine in the 1-1 draw against England at Wembley in World Cup qualifying. He is the star of his national team, netting eight times in 36 appearances. West Ham, meanwhile, have completed the signing of the 19-year-old son of Gus Poyet, Diego, from Charlton.	sports

World Cup 2014: Ray Whelan, British director of Fifa hospitality partner released from custody - Telegraph	“Match will continue to fully support all police investigations, which we firmly believe will fully exonerate Ray. “In the meantime, Ray Whelan, as well as the rest of the Match personnel will continue to work on our operational areas of responsibility in order to deliver a successful 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil.” The World Cup ticketing scandal is another embarrassment for Fifa, which has also been dogged by numerous other corruption allegations. Whelan was arrested at Rio de Janeiro’s luxurious Copacabana Palace Hotel, the official accommodation of Fifa president Sepp Blatter and other senior figures at the organisation. Blatter’s nephew, Philippe, also heads one of Match’s shareholders, Swiss-based Infront Sports. A French-Algerian suspect, Mohamadou Lamine Fofana, was initially thought to be responsible for the ticket scheme after he was among 11 people arrested last week in Rio and Sao Paulo. But suspicions moved toward an individual at Match, which sells deluxe World Cup ticket packages that include private suites at stadiums and gourmet catering. Police claimed Whelan gave VIP tickets to Fofana that were originally for sponsors, non-governmental organisations and relatives of players but were sold on illegally with the help of travel agencies and football contacts. A search of his hotel room found 82 tickets for World Cup matches, including Sunday’s final, as well as around £600 in cash. Chief investigating officer Fabio Barucke said: “Whelan denied negotiating tickets with the Franco-Algerian Mohamadou Lamine Fofana during the World Cup, but we have proof. We have 900 [intercepted] calls between the two during the tournament.” The investigation is looking into another seven suspects, but Barucke did not give more details.	sports
World Cup 2014: Premier League players fail to make Fifa / Castrol Index team of the tournament so far - Telegraph	There have been some impressive displays in between the sticks over the past month, but Claudio Bravo, the Chilean goalkeeper, is apparently the No1 No1, with a 9.26 Castrol Index rating. Earlier in the tournament the 31-year-old's £9.7-million move to Barcelona from Real Sociedad was announced. The rest of the team are largely made up of Real Madrid and Bayern Munich players. French defender Raphaël Varane, 21, has been selected at right-back after scoring an average score of 9.7, and his Spanish club team-mates in the Castrol Index side include Angel di Maria (9.46) and Karim Benzema (9.79). Representatives from Bayern include Xherdan Shaquri (9.32), Toni Kroos (9.28) and Arjen Robben (9.59) – though there is no place for four-goal Thomas Müller. Paris St Germain have two players in the Castrol Index XI, with Brazilians Thiago Silva (9.66) and David Luiz (9.56) – selected at left-back – making the grade. There is also space for James Rodríguez (9.74), the Colombian playmaker who is currently the tournament's top scorer with six, and speculation is rife that he will soon move from Monaco to Real Madrid. And Mats Hummels, the Borussia Dortmund centre-back, makes the side, scoring 9.63. In actual fact, the top-rated Premier League player in the Castrol Index is 10th-placed Jan Vertonghen. The Tottenham full-back has impressed for Belgium, especially when rampaging forward, but his 9.48 rating is not enough to make the final XI. Manchester United striker Robin van Persie is the next highest Premier League performer (9.26), in 20th, followed by Vincent Kompany (27th with 9.14) and Mesut Ozil (29th with 9.1)	sports

Neymar is injured and out of the World Cup but don't suspend Colombia's Juan Zúñiga, says Jose Mourinho - Telegraph	However, Chelsea manager Mourinho insists that the defender was right to pressurise Neymar, Brazil's danger man. "Players like Neymar if you are not aggressive, if you don’t tackle, if you don’t put yourself in a situation where the player feels you are there the player feels very very comfortable and he can win the game for his team, so of course Zúñiga went there for a contact," said the Portuguese. "He went there to stop him and maybe we can use the word, ‘dare to scare him’ but he was not there with the intention to break he was not there to hurt the way he did. So this time I agree that it makes no sense to punish a situation like that. Zúñiga, in my opinion, was oppressing the situation from behind where the player is going to try to be obviously aggressive." The 51-year-old suggested that there have been many more "dangerous situations" in the World Cup, compared to Zúñiga's challenge, in which two French players have escaped punishment. “For me the two most dangerous situations where [Mamadou] Sakho against Ecuador in the corner where he had an elbow in the face of an Ecuador player and the other one was [Blaise] Matuidi – I think he broke [Nigerian] Ogenyi Onazi's leg – these are the two really nasty actions that are difficult to except that a player is to get out of without a punishment." With three Chelsea players – Oscar, Ramires and Willian – likely to feature for Brazil on Tuesday night Mourinho will be keenly watching their semi-final match against Germany. And he thinks the hosts will have the edge over the Europeans, despite Neymar being sidelined. “You know I think the strength of Brazil you can’t stop, because the strength of Brazil is their mentality, is their approach, is their heart and that’s why I think, even without Neymar, Brazil have the team to compete with Germany and to fight to be in the final," he continued. "I don’t think Germany has to fear but Germany has to cope with a real team, a team that is not playing great football but a team that is there to win the competition and a great desire to fight to the limits and these Germany cannot stop. Can German football be enough to beat this profile of the Brazilian team? Let’s see but I think it’s a game between two big teams, one is based on their football, their tactical organisation, on their approach to have the ball and try to control the game and to have the initiative and the other side a team where the emotion is the big quality.“ Mourinho has urged Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari – a former Stamford Bridge manager – to utilise playmaker Oscar in the absence of Neymar. "I think Oscar is playing now in a position where Oscar is not Oscar and the position where Oscar is Oscar is the position where Neymar is playing now," he said. "Oscar was pushed out to the right side for Neymar to play in that position with freedom behind the striker and that’s the position where Oscar likes more to play. At the same time Willian is a better player coming from the sides in my opinion, with Oscar as a Number 10, playing in front of the two midfield players.” And the Chelsea manager also praised the perfomances of a former Blues player, Dutch winger Arjen Robben. "You have Robben fighting in an unbelievable way and leading his team, and for me this is fantastic, this is absolutely fantastic. Robben is a big player, he is not a kid anymore. He is 30-years old, it is probably his last World Cup in the maximum of his potential and Robben is showing everything he has showed during his career, the quality he has, but at the same time he is showing a physical condition and mental condition that we have to say is really amazing and I’m happy for him because he’s a very good guy.” Jose Mourinho is an exclusive analyst for Yahoo’s worldwide football coverage, www.yahoo.co.uk/worldcup is the only place to read all his expert opinions during the FIFA World Cup 2014.	sports
West Ham test waters with £9.5m move for Ukraine international Yevhen Konoplyanka - Telegraph	Dnipro are likely to insist that Konoplyanka’s buy-out clause is met before giving permission to Sullivan and Gold to open negotiations with the player. Konoplyanka looked set to move to Anfield during the January transfer window after Liverpool agreed to meet the winger’s release clause, but multi-millionaire Kolomoyskyi refused to sign the necessary paperwork. The actions of Kolomoyski put Liverpool off reviving their interest in Konoplyanka this summer and the Anfield club have since signed Adam Lallana and Lazar Markovic. West Ham’s London rivals Tottenham also bid for Konoplyanka in January, but Spurs are yet to show any sign of making a renewed offer. Konoplyanka wants to move to England this summer and West Ham will attempt to convince the 24-year-old they can match his ambition if they can agree a fee with Dnipro. In September 2012, Konoplyanka scored a long-rage goal for Ukraine in the 1-1 draw against England at Wembley in World Cup qualifying. He is the star of his national team, netting eight times in 36 appearances. West Ham, meanwhile, have completed the signing of the 19-year-old son of Gus Poyet, Diego, from Charlton.	sports

Manchester City's Joe Hart faces competition for No 1 jersey from goalkeeper Willy Caballero - Telegraph	One of the main reasons for that has been the lack of a genuine rival for him at City, but Caballero, who cost around £6m, will not have left Spain merely to sit on the bench and offer him company in training. “This is a new challenge and a new league for me,” Caballero told the club’s official website. “I have been doing well in previous years and my goal is to go on and hopefully perform at the same level for City. “I know I am coming to a big club with a very good goalkeeper. City already have a great goalkeeper in Joe Hart, but I will try and compete for the number one spot. I will do my best in the training sessions. “I am very happy and really looking forward to the start of pre-season and performing well to help the team.” Caballero, who has signed a three-year contract, is City’s third signing of the summer after the £12m purchase of Fernando from Porto and Bacary Sagna’s free transfer from Arsenal. They are also hoping to complete a deal to sign French centre-back Eliaquim Mangala from Porto. There are, however, question marks surrounding striker Álvaro Negredo’s future at the club. The Spaniard is a transfer target for Atletico Madrid who lost their main centre forward, Diego Costa, to Chelsea this summer. Negredo, who was a success in his first season at the Etihad Stadium, could be sold if his £25m valuation is met.	sports
Brazil v Germany: Dante more than capable replacement for Thiago Silva, say both sets of semi-finalists - Telegraph	Watching from the bench could lead to future employment as a coach. “I think now I'm getting older, it's coming closer and closer,’’ said Thiago, 29. “I had great coaches in my life, so you learn a bit with each one of them. Even now, playing abroad (with Paris St-Germain), you learn in different schools of football and take a little bit with you. “I've already started on memorising techniques. As a footballer, I can't end my career and walk away from the game. I'm shy, so it's difficult speaking up, but I'll work on that. People like Felipao make you think about things.’’ Luis Felipe Scolari felt that Dante, and Wolfsburg’s Luiz Gustavo, could supply useful information on the Germans. “They're important about our opponents: how they play, which side they like to run, what are their strengths and weaknesses,’’ said Scolari. “Dante still plays at Bayern. He and Luiz tell us about how they play.’’ Scolari’s German counterpart, Joachim Loew, described Dante as “an excellent player”, adding: “Dante won't deliver a bad match against Germany.’’ Loew was aware of the size of the task. “There are 200m Brazilians here cheering for their team,’’ said the German coach. “The tournament has unleashed energy on the team. But we are self-assured. We know what we can deliver. If we tap into our tactical abilities, we have a good chance. “I realised that, after Spain left, we'd be No 1 in the Fifa rankings, but that's just statistics. They're not relevant. We're concentrating on this match. The energy I've seen in the team remains outstanding. The team is totally focused. The energy is there. Those players who played against France had to go to the limit, so we've been trying to regenerate and recuperate them. I just hope the players are full of new energy. They feel well.’’	sports

Neymar could still play in World Cup for Brazil according to medical analysis by specialist Michael Davison - Telegraph	Last weekend Brazil held its collective breath as they waited to hear the injury status of their footballing talisman, Neymar. The publicly issued prognosis confirmed everyone’s worst fears and he was ruled out of the rest of the World Cup. Yet, despite the Brazilian Football Confederation’s statement to the contrary, there is perhaps some light at the end of the tournament tunnel for the player. Considering that the injury does not require surgery and there is precedent, it may not be that fanciful, if Brazil beat Germany, that he could play some part in the final on Sunday. Pain will be the limiting factor for the player’s involvement. In the world of football medicine this diagnosis is slightly vague, and for many experts outside the immediate care of the player it is their belief that it is almost certain to be a new acute transverse process fracture. A transverse process fracture is quite a rare injury and usually results from a sudden extreme twisting or side bending movement. As in this case it can also occur due to a direct impact, although muscle in that area normally cushions the blow. Due to the location of the fracture it is unlikely to cause any instability of the spine or any damage to the spinal cord. For now, a brace will keep the spine straight to allow healing of the bone. The other diagnosis is an old injury, such as a pars defect, that has been discovered on imaging. Often players will carry injuries without symptoms, and it is only when scanned are they discovered. In rugby so-called trunk tackling is legal and these injuries are more common. Players can miss six to eight weeks of competitive action, but others do not miss a game. Pain is the guide. If it is then a transverse process fracture or an old injury, then the pain that the player feels is the obstacle to playing. In this instance there would be no long-term adverse outcome. Considering the circumstances Brazil would likely administer a local anaesthetic, then fitness test him and if he can run and kick with a manageable level of pain then he would be available for selection. Certainly his natural adrenaline would also act as huge painkiller for a World Cup final.

He is 30-years old, it is probably his last World Cup in the maximum of his potential and Robben is showing everything he has showed during his career, the quality he has, but at the same time he is showing a physical condition and mental condition that we have to say is really amazing and I’m happy for him because he’s a very good guy.” Jose Mourinho is an exclusive analyst for Yahoo’s worldwide football coverage, www.yahoo.co.uk/worldcup is the only place to read all his expert opinions during the FIFA World Cup 2014.	sports
Neymar could still play in World Cup for Brazil according to medical analysis by specialist Michael Davison - Telegraph	Last weekend Brazil held its collective breath as they waited to hear the injury status of their footballing talisman, Neymar. The publicly issued prognosis confirmed everyone’s worst fears and he was ruled out of the rest of the World Cup. Yet, despite the Brazilian Football Confederation’s statement to the contrary, there is perhaps some light at the end of the tournament tunnel for the player. Considering that the injury does not require surgery and there is precedent, it may not be that fanciful, if Brazil beat Germany, that he could play some part in the final on Sunday. Pain will be the limiting factor for the player’s involvement. In the world of football medicine this diagnosis is slightly vague, and for many experts outside the immediate care of the player it is their belief that it is almost certain to be a new acute transverse process fracture. A transverse process fracture is quite a rare injury and usually results from a sudden extreme twisting or side bending movement. As in this case it can also occur due to a direct impact, although muscle in that area normally cushions the blow. Due to the location of the fracture it is unlikely to cause any instability of the spine or any damage to the spinal cord. For now, a brace will keep the spine straight to allow healing of the bone. The other diagnosis is an old injury, such as a pars defect, that has been discovered on imaging. Often players will carry injuries without symptoms, and it is only when scanned are they discovered. In rugby so-called trunk tackling is legal and these injuries are more common. Players can miss six to eight weeks of competitive action, but others do not miss a game. Pain is the guide. If it is then a transverse process fracture or an old injury, then the pain that the player feels is the obstacle to playing. In this instance there would be no long-term adverse outcome. Considering the circumstances Brazil would likely administer a local anaesthetic, then fitness test him and if he can run and kick with a manageable level of pain then he would be available for selection. Certainly his natural adrenaline would also act as huge painkiller for a World Cup final.

Manchester City's Joe Hart faces competition for No 1 jersey from goalkeeper Willy Caballero - Telegraph	One of the main reasons for that has been the lack of a genuine rival for him at City, but Caballero, who cost around £6m, will not have left Spain merely to sit on the bench and offer him company in training. “This is a new challenge and a new league for me,” Caballero told the club’s official website. “I have been doing well in previous years and my goal is to go on and hopefully perform at the same level for City. “I know I am coming to a big club with a very good goalkeeper. City already have a great goalkeeper in Joe Hart, but I will try and compete for the number one spot. I will do my best in the training sessions. “I am very happy and really looking forward to the start of pre-season and performing well to help the team.” Caballero, who has signed a three-year contract, is City’s third signing of the summer after the £12m purchase of Fernando from Porto and Bacary Sagna’s free transfer from Arsenal. They are also hoping to complete a deal to sign French centre-back Eliaquim Mangala from Porto. There are, however, question marks surrounding striker Álvaro Negredo’s future at the club. The Spaniard is a transfer target for Atletico Madrid who lost their main centre forward, Diego Costa, to Chelsea this summer. Negredo, who was a success in his first season at the Etihad Stadium, could be sold if his £25m valuation is met.	sports

Germany immune to 'ugly' criticisms ahead of World Cup semi-final against Brazil - Telegraph	Hence, when victory is assumed, you are left with picking at the edges of how a victory is achieved, which is what ZDF reporter Boris Bückler did in his post-match interview with Germany central defender Per Mertesacker, asking Arsenal’s “Big Friendly German” whether die Nationalmannschaft wouldn’t seek to deliver some “wow factor” similar to that displayed in South Africa against England and Argentina en route to the semi-finals. “What do you want here,” was Mertesacker’s not-entirely friendly retort. “Do you want a successful World Cup, or that we should again be eliminated but have played attractively? We have progressed and are ‘super happy’.” Mertesacker did not seem entirely “super happy,” nor that friendly, now that I think on it. The response among Germany’s fans was overwhelmingly supportive of Mertesacker, perhaps having an unintended consequence of forcing the nit-picking high-expectation set to reconsider how harshly they have judged the Joachim Löw-era German national team. More importantly, however, it seems to have given the players themselves a bit of a rallying point for the remainder of the tournament. “If other teams in other countries [win] like that, then it is dismissed as clever,” began Thomas Müller in his defence of his team-mate’s statement as well as his team’s results-oriented approach. “I don’t want to become world champion and afterwards stand up to apologise, saying, ‘Sorry that we won the final with just one goal’.” So, here we have it. Germany are playing a well-organised, high-possession game designed to limit the opposition's opportunities to exploit their primary weakness – defending fast counter-attacks – and they are doing it just effectively enough to find themselves facing the nation with the most World Cup titles playing in front of their own football-crazy fans as hosts of the tournament. Should Germany manage to squeeze out yet another ugly victory to eliminate their short-handed hosts and reach the final … well, just be happy. And definitely do not wait around for an apology.	sports

Brazil v Germany: Dante more than capable replacement for Thiago Silva, say both sets of semi-finalists - Telegraph	Watching from the bench could lead to future employment as a coach. “I think now I'm getting older, it's coming closer and closer,’’ said Thiago, 29. “I had great coaches in my life, so you learn a bit with each one of them. Even now, playing abroad (with Paris St-Germain), you learn in different schools of football and take a little bit with you. “I've already started on memorising techniques. As a footballer, I can't end my career and walk away from the game. I'm shy, so it's difficult speaking up, but I'll work on that. People like Felipao make you think about things.’’ Luis Felipe Scolari felt that Dante, and Wolfsburg’s Luiz Gustavo, could supply useful information on the Germans. “They're important about our opponents: how they play, which side they like to run, what are their strengths and weaknesses,’’ said Scolari. “Dante still plays at Bayern. He and Luiz tell us about how they play.’’ Scolari’s German counterpart, Joachim Loew, described Dante as “an excellent player”, adding: “Dante won't deliver a bad match against Germany.’’ Loew was aware of the size of the task. “There are 200m Brazilians here cheering for their team,’’ said the German coach. “The tournament has unleashed energy on the team. But we are self-assured. We know what we can deliver. If we tap into our tactical abilities, we have a good chance. “I realised that, after Spain left, we'd be No 1 in the Fifa rankings, but that's just statistics. They're not relevant. We're concentrating on this match. The energy I've seen in the team remains outstanding. The team is totally focused. The energy is there. Those players who played against France had to go to the limit, so we've been trying to regenerate and recuperate them. I just hope the players are full of new energy. They feel well.’’	sports

World Cup 2014: Ray Whelan, British director of Fifa hospitality partner, arrested in ticket touting probe - Telegraph	Whelan is not a Fifa employee but has become well known in recent years in connection with the governing body through Match, a division of Byrom plc, which is based at Cheadle in Cheshire. Match announced earlier that it had blocked sales to four companies following the seizure of tickets by Brazilian police. The four companies are Atlanta Sportif, whose chief executive was one of those arrested in Rio last week, Reliance Industries Ltd, Jet Set Sports and Pamodzi. Jet Set is based in New Jersey, Reliance is one of India’s biggest companies, and Padmodzi is based in Nigeria. A statement from Match read: “Following... the arrest of Lamine Fofana, CEO of Atlanta Sportif, engaging in illegal resales, Match Hospitality has cancelled all hospitality packages purchased by Atlanta Sportif for the remaining matches of the 2014 Fifa World Cup. Pending further investigations, Match Hospitality will block the packages of Reliance Industries Ltd, Jet Set Sports and Pamodzi. The customers and agents mentioned above are to co-operate with Match Hospitality by helping the authorities with their enquiries regarding the hospitality packages with their names on them found in Mr Fofana’s possession, failing which, Match Hospitality will cancel their tickets for the semi-final and the final too.” Police said last week that Fofana had connections with Fifa or Match and that the original source of the tickets to be sold illegally at hugely inflated prices was “someone higher up”. Match is the main provider of hospitality packages for the World Cup and paid $240 million (£140 million) for the exclusive rights to sell corporate hospitality at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups. Blatter’s nephew, Philippe Blatter, is the president of a company which is a shareholder in Match. Re-selling World Cup tickets for profit is illegal in Brazil and against Fifa rules. Police said they had information from 50,000 phone calls they tapped during their touting investigation. Fifa said yesterday it had provided officers with lists of telephone numbers for its staff and that of its service providers, which included Match. Of the more than three million tickets for the tournament, 445,500 were allocated to Match, according to Fifa, whose ticketing regulations dictate that any unsold or unused corporate hospitality tickets should be returned, to be made available to the public. Police estimated last week that the touting ring was ­making £263,000 per game by re-selling tickets. - Joy, heartbreak and outright terror of World Cup penalty shootouts - Ranking the World Cup teams from 1 to 32 - The best images from the World Cup	sports
England players should follow Roma's Ashley Cole abroad - Telegraph	We are trying to learn from the success other national teams have had, but just like learning a foreign language, the best way to understand things up is live and work in a country where it is spoken. We need more of our youngsters to have the same sort of professional hunger that has attracted Cole to move to Rome, rather than a lucrative wind-down before retirement in the USA or the Middle East, as others have done in recent years. Cole will have to learn far more than Italian in Rome. He will have to learn to train and play as the Italians do. He will be a better player for it. It is just a shame he waited for so long, until the moment his international career was over, to break free from the Premier League’s gold incrusted chains. Football is the same game played all over the world, but it is done so in many different styles. No matter how enlightened the coaching, our young players still grow up in an English environment where certain strengths are forged and traditional styles of play developed. All England’s players know is our way of doing things and it puts us at a disadvantage. The English style has been mastered by others, yet we seem naïve when it comes to coping with theirs. The speed and frenetic nature of our club football is no surprise, everyone knows how best to defend against crosses and rapid wide men, physical confrontations hold no fear and our tactics are well known, as are the best ways to counter them. When the Premier League restarts in a blaze of hype next month, you will see players from all over the globe lining up for English clubs. Sometimes foreign imports do not settle, sometimes it can take them more than a season to adapt, but the best ones eventually thrive and take that knowledge back with them to their international teams. There are many issues with English football, none of which are going to be solved solely by a 33-year-old full back signing for Roma, but Cole - who has left Chelsea - has highlighted the damagingly insular nature of our football. There was a time when our best players were lured abroad to earn more money, but the Premier League is the richest in the world. For the vast majority of our home-grown players there is nothing to be gained financially, unless you cost £80 million like Gareth Bale, from playing in Spain, Italy or Germany. In turn, when European clubs see the ludicrous sum of money Manchester United have just paid for Luke Shaw, a promising teenager with just one impressive season in the Premier League behind him, they will scoff at the prices quoted for England internationals. You pay more for a good English player, not because they are better than foreign alternatives, but because they are rare and fans still tend to crave them. The appeal, though, is therefore restricted to the clubs on this small island of ours. Nobody else is interested in paying the inflated fees. English players play in England and the best of the rest join them. That should not be a source of pride, it should be a cause for concern. Sending promising youngsters on loan to foreign clubs would be a step in the right direction, but hopefully others will have noted Cole’s decision and recognised the benefits of following suit. David Beckham was the last Englishman to enjoy success as a player abroad, but he was a superstar name for Real Madrid to add to their roster. There are plenty of English players who would jump at the chance to play for Real or Barcelona, but they need to realise, as Cole has done, that there are other big clubs on the continent worth playing for. You do not need to turn your back on home comforts forever, but if more of our best players were willing to look abroad, our national team would be, if not automatically stronger, certainly more savvy, streetwise and adaptable.	sports

Alfredo di Stéfano: A true titan of the game, regarded by many as its greatest ever exponent - Telegraph	“My greatest memory is when Aberdeen beat Real Madrid in the Cup Winners’ Cup final in 1983 and he was the (Real Madrid) coach at the time. I was honoured to be in the same (game) as Real Madrid, and to come up against Di Stéfano was an incredible experience for me. What I did was in respect to him was I got a bottle of Scottish malt whisky and gave it to him the night before the match. The two teams have an opportunity to train on the pitch of the venue for the final. We were second, they were first. And when they came off I said, ‘Mr Di Stéfano, I’d like to give you this gift.’ And he was taken aback. "He didn’t realise what I was saying, of course – I don’t speak Spanish, he doesn’t speak English – but there was an accord there. You knew he was grateful. They had household names but Aberdeen were a team on the rise. They were all brought up by Aberdeen (and were) all Scottish lads. It was an amazing achievement. After the game, he was very, very generous. He said, ‘Aberdeen have a team that money can’t buy – a soul and a family spirit. You couldn’t say any more in terms of praise of a football team. I thought it was very, very generous of him. “A few times that we played Real Madrid over the years, he was always at the game and he was always at the reception. He was at United for 50 years of the Munich Air Disaster. He came along with the Real Madrid players. They had played Manchester United in the semi-final the year before and then played them after the Munich Air Disaster in 1958. So he was always in the focus of Real Madrid, no matter where they went. He was 88 years of age, he’s had a fantastic life, and I’m really proud to have been associated with him in a small way.” Ferguson, incidentally, later pitched his wits against Di Stéfano, when the two met in management in the 1983 European Cup-Winners’ Cup final, when the Scot was in charge of Aberdeen, and the great man in the Real Madrid dug out. That Ferguson – who presented Di Stéfano with a bottle of whisky before the game – came out on top was a moment of personal satisfaction unsurpassed in his career. And for Di Stéfano it was a moment of crushing disappointment: in that season as Madrid’s coach he recorded a quadruple of second places. Di Stéfano was defined by his association with Real Madrid. When he died he was the club’s honorary president. But were it for the head of the Spanish FA in 1954, he would have been the first – and perhaps only – footballer in history to have been shared. Both Barcelona and Madrid were attempting to bring him from Colombia, where he had settled after a series of footballers’ strikes had driven him from his homeland in Argentina. The compromise suggested by the official was that the two clubs both employ him: he would play one season for one, then the next for the other. There has long been dark mutterings from Barcelona that it was the hand of General Franco who stymied such a bizarre compromise and steered Di Stéfano to Madrid, the team the dictator favoured. After Franco’s death, Di Stéfano long baulked at the association between the club and the fascist, insisting his influence there was exaggerated. Besides, the signing was likely to have been the handiwork of Santiago Bernabéu, the guiding light at Madrid, who managed to outflank his Catalan rivals and sign the player. What a coup it was. Alongside the Hungarian Ferenc Puskas, Di Stéfano dominated the early days of European club competition. One of only two players to play in every one of Madrid’s five opening European victories, his elegance, his intelligence, his precision was instrumental in their success. He was voted European footballer of the year in 1957 and 1959, and remained the most prolific marksman in the European Cup until the turn of the century, when finally overtaken by Raul. Sadly, he could not match such statistics in the international game. Which is largely why he did not figure as prominently in the wider British football imagination as he deserved. In a fit of pique, Argentina boycotted the 1950 World Cup in Brazil because they had not been asked to host it. They were still in a strop and stayed away from the 1954 tournament too. Fed up with the politics back home, Di Stéfano then turned out for Colombia when he was playing his club football there, but even with him in their number, they were not a side of any great distinction. And although, like a 1950s Diego Costa, he switched allegiance to Spain, through residential qualification, his new country did not make it to the 1958 finals.

Despite the gaping hole in his international CV, when France Football magazine named its top players of the 20th century, Di Stéfano was fourth, behind only Pele, Maradona and Johann Cruyff.

Alfredo di Stéfano: A true titan of the game, regarded by many as its greatest ever exponent - Telegraph	“My greatest memory is when Aberdeen beat Real Madrid in the Cup Winners’ Cup final in 1983 and he was the (Real Madrid) coach at the time. I was honoured to be in the same (game) as Real Madrid, and to come up against Di Stéfano was an incredible experience for me. What I did was in respect to him was I got a bottle of Scottish malt whisky and gave it to him the night before the match. The two teams have an opportunity to train on the pitch of the venue for the final. We were second, they were first. And when they came off I said, ‘Mr Di Stéfano, I’d like to give you this gift.’ And he was taken aback. "He didn’t realise what I was saying, of course – I don’t speak Spanish, he doesn’t speak English – but there was an accord there. You knew he was grateful. They had household names but Aberdeen were a team on the rise. They were all brought up by Aberdeen (and were) all Scottish lads. It was an amazing achievement. After the game, he was very, very generous. He said, ‘Aberdeen have a team that money can’t buy – a soul and a family spirit. You couldn’t say any more in terms of praise of a football team. I thought it was very, very generous of him. “A few times that we played Real Madrid over the years, he was always at the game and he was always at the reception. He was at United for 50 years of the Munich Air Disaster. He came along with the Real Madrid players. They had played Manchester United in the semi-final the year before and then played them after the Munich Air Disaster in 1958. So he was always in the focus of Real Madrid, no matter where they went. He was 88 years of age, he’s had a fantastic life, and I’m really proud to have been associated with him in a small way.” Ferguson, incidentally, later pitched his wits against Di Stéfano, when the two met in management in the 1983 European Cup-Winners’ Cup final, when the Scot was in charge of Aberdeen, and the great man in the Real Madrid dug out. That Ferguson – who presented Di Stéfano with a bottle of whisky before the game – came out on top was a moment of personal satisfaction unsurpassed in his career. And for Di Stéfano it was a moment of crushing disappointment: in that season as Madrid’s coach he recorded a quadruple of second places. Di Stéfano was defined by his association with Real Madrid. When he died he was the club’s honorary president. But were it for the head of the Spanish FA in 1954, he would have been the first – and perhaps only – footballer in history to have been shared. Both Barcelona and Madrid were attempting to bring him from Colombia, where he had settled after a series of footballers’ strikes had driven him from his homeland in Argentina. The compromise suggested by the official was that the two clubs both employ him: he would play one season for one, then the next for the other. There has long been dark mutterings from Barcelona that it was the hand of General Franco who stymied such a bizarre compromise and steered Di Stéfano to Madrid, the team the dictator favoured. After Franco’s death, Di Stéfano long baulked at the association between the club and the fascist, insisting his influence there was exaggerated. Besides, the signing was likely to have been the handiwork of Santiago Bernabéu, the guiding light at Madrid, who managed to outflank his Catalan rivals and sign the player. What a coup it was. Alongside the Hungarian Ferenc Puskas, Di Stéfano dominated the early days of European club competition. One of only two players to play in every one of Madrid’s five opening European victories, his elegance, his intelligence, his precision was instrumental in their success. He was voted European footballer of the year in 1957 and 1959, and remained the most prolific marksman in the European Cup until the turn of the century, when finally overtaken by Raul. Sadly, he could not match such statistics in the international game. Which is largely why he did not figure as prominently in the wider British football imagination as he deserved. In a fit of pique, Argentina boycotted the 1950 World Cup in Brazil because they had not been asked to host it. They were still in a strop and stayed away from the 1954 tournament too.

England players should follow Roma's Ashley Cole abroad - Telegraph	We are trying to learn from the success other national teams have had, but just like learning a foreign language, the best way to understand things up is live and work in a country where it is spoken. We need more of our youngsters to have the same sort of professional hunger that has attracted Cole to move to Rome, rather than a lucrative wind-down before retirement in the USA or the Middle East, as others have done in recent years. Cole will have to learn far more than Italian in Rome. He will have to learn to train and play as the Italians do. He will be a better player for it. It is just a shame he waited for so long, until the moment his international career was over, to break free from the Premier League’s gold incrusted chains. Football is the same game played all over the world, but it is done so in many different styles. No matter how enlightened the coaching, our young players still grow up in an English environment where certain strengths are forged and traditional styles of play developed. All England’s players know is our way of doing things and it puts us at a disadvantage. The English style has been mastered by others, yet we seem naïve when it comes to coping with theirs. The speed and frenetic nature of our club football is no surprise, everyone knows how best to defend against crosses and rapid wide men, physical confrontations hold no fear and our tactics are well known, as are the best ways to counter them. When the Premier League restarts in a blaze of hype next month, you will see players from all over the globe lining up for English clubs. Sometimes foreign imports do not settle, sometimes it can take them more than a season to adapt, but the best ones eventually thrive and take that knowledge back with them to their international teams. There are many issues with English football, none of which are going to be solved solely by a 33-year-old full back signing for Roma, but Cole - who has left Chelsea - has highlighted the damagingly insular nature of our football. There was a time when our best players were lured abroad to earn more money, but the Premier League is the richest in the world. For the vast majority of our home-grown players there is nothing to be gained financially, unless you cost £80 million like Gareth Bale, from playing in Spain, Italy or Germany. In turn, when European clubs see the ludicrous sum of money Manchester United have just paid for Luke Shaw, a promising teenager with just one impressive season in the Premier League behind him, they will scoff at the prices quoted for England internationals. You pay more for a good English player, not because they are better than foreign alternatives, but because they are rare and fans still tend to crave them. The appeal, though, is therefore restricted to the clubs on this small island of ours. Nobody else is interested in paying the inflated fees. English players play in England and the best of the rest join them. That should not be a source of pride, it should be a cause for concern. Sending promising youngsters on loan to foreign clubs would be a step in the right direction, but hopefully others will have noted Cole’s decision and recognised the benefits of following suit. David Beckham was the last Englishman to enjoy success as a player abroad, but he was a superstar name for Real Madrid to add to their roster. There are plenty of English players who would jump at the chance to play for Real or Barcelona, but they need to realise, as Cole has done, that there are other big clubs on the continent worth playing for. You do not need to turn your back on home comforts forever, but if more of our best players were willing to look abroad, our national team would be, if not automatically stronger, certainly more savvy, streetwise and adaptable.	sports
World Cup 2014: Ray Whelan, British director of Fifa hospitality partner, arrested in ticket touting probe - Telegraph	Whelan is not a Fifa employee but has become well known in recent years in connection with the governing body through Match, a division of Byrom plc, which is based at Cheadle in Cheshire. Match announced earlier that it had blocked sales to four companies following the seizure of tickets by Brazilian police. The four companies are Atlanta Sportif, whose chief executive was one of those arrested in Rio last week, Reliance Industries Ltd, Jet Set Sports and Pamodzi. Jet Set is based in New Jersey, Reliance is one of India’s biggest companies, and Padmodzi is based in Nigeria. A statement from Match read: “Following... the arrest of Lamine Fofana, CEO of Atlanta Sportif, engaging in illegal resales, Match Hospitality has cancelled all hospitality packages purchased by Atlanta Sportif for the remaining matches of the 2014 Fifa World Cup. Pending further investigations, Match Hospitality will block the packages of Reliance Industries Ltd, Jet Set Sports and Pamodzi. The customers and agents mentioned above are to co-operate with Match Hospitality by helping the authorities with their enquiries regarding the hospitality packages with their names on them found in Mr Fofana’s possession, failing which, Match Hospitality will cancel their tickets for the semi-final and the final too.” Police said last week that Fofana had connections with Fifa or Match and that the original source of the tickets to be sold illegally at hugely inflated prices was “someone higher up”. Match is the main provider of hospitality packages for the World Cup and paid $240 million (£140 million) for the exclusive rights to sell corporate hospitality at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups. Blatter’s nephew, Philippe Blatter, is the president of a company which is a shareholder in Match. Re-selling World Cup tickets for profit is illegal in Brazil and against Fifa rules. Police said they had information from 50,000 phone calls they tapped during their touting investigation. Fifa said yesterday it had provided officers with lists of telephone numbers for its staff and that of its service providers, which included Match. Of the more than three million tickets for the tournament, 445,500 were allocated to Match, according to Fifa, whose ticketing regulations dictate that any unsold or unused corporate hospitality tickets should be returned, to be made available to the public. Police estimated last week that the touting ring was ­making £263,000 per game by re-selling tickets. - Joy, heartbreak and outright terror of World Cup penalty shootouts - Ranking the World Cup teams from 1 to 32 - The best images from the World Cup	sports

World Cup 2014: Wesley Sneijder hails Holland's Arjen Robben ahead of semi-final clash with Argentina - Telegraph	Holland will train in Sao Paulo on Tuesday with a growing sense of confidence that after losing three World Cup finals it could the Oranje’s turn to finally win the trophy. Dirk Kuyt, who has been a versatile member of Louis van Gaal’s team, echoed remarks from captain Robin van Persie who said it was not “a dream” to face Argentina at this stage. The “dream”, Van Persie said, was to “hold the World Cup”. “It’s great to be among the top four countries in the world,” Kuyt said. “ And if you look at the names in the semi-finals, Brazil, Argentina, Germany and the Netherlands, that’s where you want to be, where you want to deliver. We want to measure ourselves against the best and beat the best. We want to just beat Argentina -and then bring the World Cup home.” The countries famously faced each other in the 1978 final, which Argentina hosted and won 3-1, and more recently in 2006 in the group stages of the tournament which ended in a goalless draw. “In 2006 in Germany it was very different,” said Kuyt, who, along with Sneijder, played in that game. “It was at a time when we were both already qualified. Now it is all or nothing. I think it’s a great tournament so far. The football, the atmosphere in Brazil, the brilliant games and the way we won the duels: beautiful. And now we compete with Argentina. “I understand that there are 40,000 Argentinians who will be in the stadium. I love that. Against Chile and Mexico, our fans were in the minority. Hostility gives us strength.” Such confidence may be new-born for the Dutch with Fifa defending the fact that Van Gaal’s squad had to quit their team base in Rio de Janeiro on Monday – because they had only booked it until then. The Dutch have occupied the Caesar Park Hotel, which overlooks Ipanema beach, and only signed a contract until July 7. The hotel will now be used by Fifa and its army of corporate sponsors for the final with the Dutch, should they win the semi-final, having to use another hotel. “Fifa is not throwing them out of the hotel,” Fifa spokesman Delia Fisher maintained. “They signed a contract directly with the hotel and their decision was July 7 – that was the date they decided to end their team base camp.” But then neither is Fifa prepared to step aside to allow the Dutch to stay. There is relief for the Argentines that they have reached their first semi-final since 1990 and ended what had become 24 years not of hurt but of shame. Coach Alejandro Sabella has looked less tense following Saturday’s quarter-final victory over Belgium as reaching the last four was a minimum requirement. Sabella will have to cope without Ángel Di María for the semi-final with the Argentine football federation officially ruling out the Real Madrid winger on Monday following the thigh injury he picked up against Belgium. The coach is unlikely to recall Sergio Agüero, who is still struggling with fitness, so is expected to turn to either former Liverpool midfielder Maxi Rodríguez or Enzo Pérez. - Joy, heartbreak and outright terror of World Cup penalty shootouts - Ranking the World Cup teams from 1 to 32 - The best images from the World Cup	sports

FA acknowledging importance of futsal as a development tool in wake of England's early World Cup departure - Telegraph	Neymar is a devotee. So was Pele growing up. Xavi and Andrés Iniesta honed their admired technique partly through futsal. “If you look at the background of many top Spanish and Brazilian players it was part of their player-development programme,’’ continued Levett. “Xavi and Iniesta talk about it being the key tool to helping them play in tight spaces and being comfortable receiving the ball when marked or when outnumbered.” Futsal-inspired goals have graced great occasions. “There was a goal from Ronaldinho when he was at Barcelona against Chelsea in the Champions League a few years back [2005], a toe punt from 20 yards, that everyone here criticised for bad technique,’’ laughed Levett. Ronaldinho’s finish culminated a shimmying run and was fully intended, being from the futsal canon. Many English observers were simply not aware of futsal techniques. The style has been seen at this World Cup. “Oscar scored in the first game for Brazil [against Croatia] with a similar finish, shooting early with the toe and not allowing the goalkeeper to get set and ready,’’ Levett said. Fernandinho scored with a toe-punt against Cameroon. In Wednesday’s Sao Paulo semi between Argentina and Holland, fans can admire how Lionel Messi’s futsal past helped shape his brilliant present. Now the English are becoming believers. “We are fairly new to the scene – we started about 2005 – seeing as the game has been around since the 1930s,’’ added Levett, “but as a version of five-a-side we used to play one with an inflated tennis ball, no overhead height rules and the ability to smash people against walls! The rest of the world learn to play in tight areas and when under pressure. “There is a lot of correlation between top-ranked football teams and top-ranked futsal teams but it’s not an exact science. Germany, for example, have less background in futsal than us but there are professional leagues in Italy and Spain. The Premier League have introduced festivals and tournaments for younger age groups over the last four years as part of the games programme for academies too.’’ Futsal can play a significant role in England’s future. “Is it the panacea?’’ asked Levett. “No. Is it part of the solution? Absolutely. It is seen as a major part of the development programme moving forwards. There are more and more youth leagues now running this as their winter option for grass-roots football such as in Shropshire, Hull and Sheffield, and I can only see it growing.” Good. More futsal in schools should also be a target. Germany's secret weapon rejected by England The Germans’ formidable stamina in this World Cup is partly due to a secret weapon turned down by England because the Football Association felt it had insufficient time to test it properly. The CoolingGlove, an $1,800 (£1,050) mitt designed by Stanford University scientists that pumps iced water around the hand, is donned by players in the dressing room at half-time, immediately reducing their temperatures. This prevents the onset of cramp, according to Trevor Steven, the former England international who took the CoreControl product to the FA. “I talked to Dave Reddin [the FA’s head of performance services],’’ Steven said. “This would have cost them $30,000. We didn’t get it to them soon enough. They wanted more time to look at it. I was disappointed but I totally understand. “The Germans have had it for 18 months. The Germans bought 20 units, they’ve been using it, and it did not surprise me that in the France v Germany [quarter-final] game, the top five distances were covered by German players. “I’m seeing it in their dressing room; it’s not just for decoration. You don’t get cramp with this. You reboot your system at half-time. It cools you from the inside, rather than the outside with air-conditioning in the dressing room which is only superficial in bringing your heat down. “It’s not going to make England a better footballing team but small details are important. In Mexico in 1986, it was incredibly hot and we just had cold towels wrapped round our heads at half-time.” Incomparable Ingham will be missed On a journey back from Europe with Arsenal once, the club’s press officer was looking for a distinguished commentator travelling with the party. “Mike Ingham, Mike Ingham,’’ she called, to which everyone replied “Mike Ingham for a horse”. To which someone else added: “Seems like a fair swap.’’ Ingham, though, is incomparable and the BBC airwaves will be a poorer place when he retires after Sunday’s World Cup final. Ingham, a passionate Derby County fan who needs little encouragement to reminisce about Kevin Hector’s debut, is one of the great broadcasters because he accelerates his delivery in time with a move’s climax when too many commentators kick too soon. His eloquence, knowledge and balance in his judgments also make Mike Ingham MBE incomparable in the broadcasting kingdom. - Joy, heartbreak and outright terror of World Cup penalty shootouts - Ranking the World Cup teams from 1 to 32 - The best images from the World Cup	sports

Alfredo di Stéfano: A true titan of the game, regarded by many as its greatest ever exponent - Telegraph	“My greatest memory is when Aberdeen beat Real Madrid in the Cup Winners’ Cup final in 1983 and he was the (Real Madrid) coach at the time. I was honoured to be in the same (game) as Real Madrid, and to come up against Di Stéfano was an incredible experience for me. What I did was in respect to him was I got a bottle of Scottish malt whisky and gave it to him the night before the match. The two teams have an opportunity to train on the pitch of the venue for the final. We were second, they were first. And when they came off I said, ‘Mr Di Stéfano, I’d like to give you this gift.’ And he was taken aback. "He didn’t realise what I was saying, of course – I don’t speak Spanish, he doesn’t speak English – but there was an accord there. You knew he was grateful. They had household names but Aberdeen were a team on the rise. They were all brought up by Aberdeen (and were) all Scottish lads. It was an amazing achievement. After the game, he was very, very generous. He said, ‘Aberdeen have a team that money can’t buy – a soul and a family spirit. You couldn’t say any more in terms of praise of a football team. I thought it was very, very generous of him. “A few times that we played Real Madrid over the years, he was always at the game and he was always at the reception. He was at United for 50 years of the Munich Air Disaster. He came along with the Real Madrid players. They had played Manchester United in the semi-final the year before and then played them after the Munich Air Disaster in 1958. So he was always in the focus of Real Madrid, no matter where they went. He was 88 years of age, he’s had a fantastic life, and I’m really proud to have been associated with him in a small way.” Ferguson, incidentally, later pitched his wits against Di Stéfano, when the two met in management in the 1983 European Cup-Winners’ Cup final, when the Scot was in charge of Aberdeen, and the great man in the Real Madrid dug out. That Ferguson – who presented Di Stéfano with a bottle of whisky before the game – came out on top was a moment of personal satisfaction unsurpassed in his career. And for Di Stéfano it was a moment of crushing disappointment: in that season as Madrid’s coach he recorded a quadruple of second places. Di Stéfano was defined by his association with Real Madrid. When he died he was the club’s honorary president. But were it for the head of the Spanish FA in 1954, he would have been the first – and perhaps only – footballer in history to have been shared. Both Barcelona and Madrid were attempting to bring him from Colombia, where he had settled after a series of footballers’ strikes had driven him from his homeland in Argentina. The compromise suggested by the official was that the two clubs both employ him: he would play one season for one, then the next for the other. There has long been dark mutterings from Barcelona that it was the hand of General Franco who stymied such a bizarre compromise and steered Di Stéfano to Madrid, the team the dictator favoured. After Franco’s death, Di Stéfano long baulked at the association between the club and the fascist, insisting his influence there was exaggerated. Besides, the signing was likely to have been the handiwork of Santiago Bernabéu, the guiding light at Madrid, who managed to outflank his Catalan rivals and sign the player. What a coup it was. Alongside the Hungarian Ferenc Puskas, Di Stéfano dominated the early days of European club competition. One of only two players to play in every one of Madrid’s five opening European victories, his elegance, his intelligence, his precision was instrumental in their success. He was voted European footballer of the year in 1957 and 1959, and remained the most prolific marksman in the European Cup until the turn of the century, when finally overtaken by Raul. Sadly, he could not match such statistics in the international game. Which is largely why he did not figure as prominently in the wider British football imagination as he deserved. In a fit of pique, Argentina boycotted the 1950 World Cup in Brazil because they had not been asked to host it. They were still in a strop and stayed away from the 1954 tournament too. Fed up with the politics back home, Di Stéfano then turned out for Colombia when he was playing his club football there, but even with him in their number, they were not a side of any great distinction. And although, like a 1950s Diego Costa, he switched allegiance to Spain, through residential qualification, his new country did not make it to the 1958 finals. When his adopted nation finally made it through in 1962, largely through his prompting, he was injured in the weeks leading up to the tournament. Despite the gaping hole in his international CV, when France Football magazine named its top players of the 20th century, Di Stéfano was fourth, behind only Pele, Maradona and Johann Cruyff. It is a legitimate assessment: if Martin Peters was a player 10 years ahead of his time, Di Stéfano was playing a good half century ahead of himself. On hearing the news of his passing, Rodney Marsh suggested this was the original false number nine, long before the tactic was invented. Deceptive, elusive, impossible to predict, his ability to find space in the most crowded of attacking positions was material in itself for investigation by Stephen Hawking. Charlton was not making it up: this was one of football’s true titans. - Alfredo Di Stefano - obituary - Di Stefano's greatest moments	sports

England players should follow Roma's Ashley Cole abroad - Telegraph	We are trying to learn from the success other national teams have had, but just like learning a foreign language, the best way to understand things up is live and work in a country where it is spoken. We need more of our youngsters to have the same sort of professional hunger that has attracted Cole to move to Rome, rather than a lucrative wind-down before retirement in the USA or the Middle East, as others have done in recent years. Cole will have to learn far more than Italian in Rome. He will have to learn to train and play as the Italians do. He will be a better player for it. It is just a shame he waited for so long, until the moment his international career was over, to break free from the Premier League’s gold incrusted chains. Football is the same game played all over the world, but it is done so in many different styles. No matter how enlightened the coaching, our young players still grow up in an English environment where certain strengths are forged and traditional styles of play developed. All England’s players know is our way of doing things and it puts us at a disadvantage. The English style has been mastered by others, yet we seem naïve when it comes to coping with theirs. The speed and frenetic nature of our club football is no surprise, everyone knows how best to defend against crosses and rapid wide men, physical confrontations hold no fear and our tactics are well known, as are the best ways to counter them. When the Premier League restarts in a blaze of hype next month, you will see players from all over the globe lining up for English clubs. Sometimes foreign imports do not settle, sometimes it can take them more than a season to adapt, but the best ones eventually thrive and take that knowledge back with them to their international teams. There are many issues with English football, none of which are going to be solved solely by a 33-year-old full back signing for Roma, but Cole - who has left Chelsea - has highlighted the damagingly insular nature of our football. There was a time when our best players were lured abroad to earn more money, but the Premier League is the richest in the world. For the vast majority of our home-grown players there is nothing to be gained financially, unless you cost £80 million like Gareth Bale, from playing in Spain, Italy or Germany. In turn, when European clubs see the ludicrous sum of money Manchester United have just paid for Luke Shaw, a promising teenager with just one impressive season in the Premier League behind him, they will scoff at the prices quoted for England internationals. You pay more for a good English player, not because they are better than foreign alternatives, but because they are rare and fans still tend to crave them. The appeal, though, is therefore restricted to the clubs on this small island of ours. Nobody else is interested in paying the inflated fees. English players play in England and the best of the rest join them. That should not be a source of pride, it should be a cause for concern. Sending promising youngsters on loan to foreign clubs would be a step in the right direction, but hopefully others will have noted Cole’s decision and recognised the benefits of following suit. David Beckham was the last Englishman to enjoy success as a player abroad, but he was a superstar name for Real Madrid to add to their roster. There are plenty of English players who would jump at the chance to play for Real or Barcelona, but they need to realise, as Cole has done, that there are other big clubs on the continent worth playing for. You do not need to turn your back on home comforts forever, but if more of our best players were willing to look abroad, our national team would be, if not automatically stronger, certainly more savvy, streetwise and adaptable.	sports

World Cup 2014: Wesley Sneijder hails Holland's Arjen Robben ahead of semi-final clash with Argentina - Telegraph	Holland will train in Sao Paulo on Tuesday with a growing sense of confidence that after losing three World Cup finals it could the Oranje’s turn to finally win the trophy. Dirk Kuyt, who has been a versatile member of Louis van Gaal’s team, echoed remarks from captain Robin van Persie who said it was not “a dream” to face Argentina at this stage. The “dream”, Van Persie said, was to “hold the World Cup”. “It’s great to be among the top four countries in the world,” Kuyt said. “ And if you look at the names in the semi-finals, Brazil, Argentina, Germany and the Netherlands, that’s where you want to be, where you want to deliver. We want to measure ourselves against the best and beat the best. We want to just beat Argentina -and then bring the World Cup home.” The countries famously faced each other in the 1978 final, which Argentina hosted and won 3-1, and more recently in 2006 in the group stages of the tournament which ended in a goalless draw. “In 2006 in Germany it was very different,” said Kuyt, who, along with Sneijder, played in that game. “It was at a time when we were both already qualified. Now it is all or nothing. I think it’s a great tournament so far. The football, the atmosphere in Brazil, the brilliant games and the way we won the duels: beautiful. And now we compete with Argentina. “I understand that there are 40,000 Argentinians who will be in the stadium. I love that. Against Chile and Mexico, our fans were in the minority. Hostility gives us strength.” Such confidence may be new-born for the Dutch with Fifa defending the fact that Van Gaal’s squad had to quit their team base in Rio de Janeiro on Monday – because they had only booked it until then. The Dutch have occupied the Caesar Park Hotel, which overlooks Ipanema beach, and only signed a contract until July 7. The hotel will now be used by Fifa and its army of corporate sponsors for the final with the Dutch, should they win the semi-final, having to use another hotel. “Fifa is not throwing them out of the hotel,” Fifa spokesman Delia Fisher maintained. “They signed a contract directly with the hotel and their decision was July 7 – that was the date they decided to end their team base camp.” But then neither is Fifa prepared to step aside to allow the Dutch to stay. There is relief for the Argentines that they have reached their first semi-final since 1990 and ended what had become 24 years not of hurt but of shame. Coach Alejandro Sabella has looked less tense following Saturday’s quarter-final victory over Belgium as reaching the last four was a minimum requirement. Sabella will have to cope without Ángel Di María for the semi-final with the Argentine football federation officially ruling out the Real Madrid winger on Monday following the thigh injury he picked up against Belgium. The coach is unlikely to recall Sergio Agüero, who is still struggling with fitness, so is expected to turn to either former Liverpool midfielder Maxi Rodríguez or Enzo Pérez. - Joy, heartbreak and outright terror of World Cup penalty shootouts - Ranking the World Cup teams from 1 to 32 - The best images from the World Cup	sports

FA acknowledging importance of futsal as a development tool in wake of England's early World Cup departure - Telegraph	Neymar is a devotee. So was Pele growing up. Xavi and Andrés Iniesta honed their admired technique partly through futsal. “If you look at the background of many top Spanish and Brazilian players it was part of their player-development programme,’’ continued Levett. “Xavi and Iniesta talk about it being the key tool to helping them play in tight spaces and being comfortable receiving the ball when marked or when outnumbered.” Futsal-inspired goals have graced great occasions. “There was a goal from Ronaldinho when he was at Barcelona against Chelsea in the Champions League a few years back [2005], a toe punt from 20 yards, that everyone here criticised for bad technique,’’ laughed Levett. Ronaldinho’s finish culminated a shimmying run and was fully intended, being from the futsal canon. Many English observers were simply not aware of futsal techniques. The style has been seen at this World Cup. “Oscar scored in the first game for Brazil [against Croatia] with a similar finish, shooting early with the toe and not allowing the goalkeeper to get set and ready,’’ Levett said. Fernandinho scored with a toe-punt against Cameroon. In Wednesday’s Sao Paulo semi between Argentina and Holland, fans can admire how Lionel Messi’s futsal past helped shape his brilliant present. Now the English are becoming believers. “We are fairly new to the scene – we started about 2005 – seeing as the game has been around since the 1930s,’’ added Levett, “but as a version of five-a-side we used to play one with an inflated tennis ball, no overhead height rules and the ability to smash people against walls! The rest of the world learn to play in tight areas and when under pressure. “There is a lot of correlation between top-ranked football teams and top-ranked futsal teams but it’s not an exact science. Germany, for example, have less background in futsal than us but there are professional leagues in Italy and Spain. The Premier League have introduced festivals and tournaments for younger age groups over the last four years as part of the games programme for academies too.’’ Futsal can play a significant role in England’s future. “Is it the panacea?’’ asked Levett. “No. Is it part of the solution? Absolutely. It is seen as a major part of the development programme moving forwards. There are more and more youth leagues now running this as their winter option for grass-roots football such as in Shropshire, Hull and Sheffield, and I can only see it growing.” Good. More futsal in schools should also be a target. Germany's secret weapon rejected by England The Germans’ formidable stamina in this World Cup is partly due to a secret weapon turned down by England because the Football Association felt it had insufficient time to test it properly. The CoolingGlove, an $1,800 (£1,050) mitt designed by Stanford University scientists that pumps iced water around the hand, is donned by players in the dressing room at half-time, immediately reducing their temperatures. This prevents the onset of cramp, according to Trevor Steven, the former England international who took the CoreControl product to the FA. “I talked to Dave Reddin [the FA’s head of performance services],’’ Steven said. “This would have cost them $30,000. We didn’t get it to them soon enough. They wanted more time to look at it. I was disappointed but I totally understand. “The Germans have had it for 18 months. The Germans bought 20 units, they’ve been using it, and it did not surprise me that in the France v Germany [quarter-final] game, the top five distances were covered by German players. “I’m seeing it in their dressing room; it’s not just for decoration. You don’t get cramp with this. You reboot your system at half-time. It cools you from the inside, rather than the outside with air-conditioning in the dressing room which is only superficial in bringing your heat down. “It’s not going to make England a better footballing team but small details are important. In Mexico in 1986, it was incredibly hot and we just had cold towels wrapped round our heads at half-time.” Incomparable Ingham will be missed On a journey back from Europe with Arsenal once, the club’s press officer was looking for a distinguished commentator travelling with the party. “Mike Ingham, Mike Ingham,’’ she called, to which everyone replied “Mike Ingham for a horse”. To which someone else added: “Seems like a fair swap.’’ Ingham, though, is incomparable and the BBC airwaves will be a poorer place when he retires after Sunday’s World Cup final. Ingham, a passionate Derby County fan who needs little encouragement to reminisce about Kevin Hector’s debut, is one of the great broadcasters because he accelerates his delivery in time with a move’s climax when too many commentators kick too soon. His eloquence, knowledge and balance in his judgments also make Mike Ingham MBE incomparable in the broadcasting kingdom. - Joy, heartbreak and outright terror of World Cup penalty shootouts - Ranking the World Cup teams from 1 to 32 - The best images from the World Cup	sports

Ashley Cole greeted by Roma fans at airport ahead of free transfer move to Serie A giants from Chelsea - Telegraph	Cole’s ex-Chelsea and England team-mate Frank Lampard is set to play in the Australian A-League before moving to Major League Soccer in the United States with Manchester City’s New York City franchise. But Cole was adamant that he did not want to finish his career in an inferior league. Cole has signed a two-year contract, with the option of a third year that would take him up to the age of 36 and means Roma is set to be his third and final permanent club. He has the opportunity to keep earning more than £100,000 a week at Roma as long as he plays on a regular basis. Cole, who had his medical at the Pope’s official hospital in Rome, is set to kick off his Roma career against familiar opposition, Liverpool and Manchester United, later this month. After sealing his Roma switch, Cole will join the club on their pre-season tour of the United States and compete in the Guinness International Champions Cup. Roma and Cole face Liverpool at Fenway Park in Boston on July 23, before taking on United at the Sports Authority Field in Denver three days later. In the United clash Cole will go head-to-head with Luke Shaw, who has taken his place in the England squad. Roma also have games scheduled against Real Madrid and Inter Milan in America, before the Serie A season starts. Cole began his career at Arsenal, where he made 228 appearances and won two Premier League titles and the FA Cup three times before controversially joining Chelsea in 2006. During eight years at Stamford Bridge, Cole played 338 times and won the Premier League, the FA Cup on four occasions, the League Cup, the Champions League and the Europa League. Atlético Madrid left-back Filipe Luis has been earmarked as Chelsea’s first-choice replacement for Cole, with Argentina international Marcos Rojo an alternative option. Other than seeing Cole join Roma, Chelsea are also prepared to let reserve left-back Ryan Bertrand leave Stamford Bridge this summer with Liverpool, Tottenham, Southampton and Aston Villa interested. Chelsea return for pre-season training without Cole this week, although the club’s World Cup players will start later. New signing Cesc Fabregas is due to officially begin work with the Blues on July 21, along with fellow Spain international Diego Costa. England international Gary Cahill, who did not make it past the group stages of the World Cup, will return to pre-season training in time for Chelsea’s trip to Austria. Upon his arrival, Roma posted a photo on their official Twitter feed, with the message: "Welcome to Rome, Ashley!".

Tottenham fail in bid to land Ben Davies and Michel Vorm by offering Swansea City Gylfi Sigurdsson in return - Telegraph	Despite the fact Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins is prepared to play hardball over deals for them, Davies and Vorm will be allowed to leave the Liberty Stadium if the right offer is made. Swansea can replace 21-year-old Davies with Neil Taylor and the club have already signed Lukasz Fabianski on a free transfer to take over first-choice goalkeeping duties from Vorm. Tottenham's interest in Holland international Vorm raises further question marks over the future of goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, despite the club's insistence the Frenchman is not for sale. Lloris has claimed he expects to start the new season with Spurs, but Paris Saint-Germain could yet test Levy's resolve to keep the 27-year-old. Veteran Brad Friedel signed a new one-year contract to stay at Spurs. Re-signing Sigurdsson would help Swansea make up for the anticipated departure of Spanish forward Michu, who has not travelled on the club's pre-season trip to the United States. Napoli have enquired about signing Michu and are keen on an initial loan deal with a view to a permanent transfer. There are also doubts over the future of Swansea winger Pablo Hernandez, who was not expected to travel to the United States.	sports

Manchester United reveal new kit for 2014-15 Premier League season - Telegraph	The shirt welcomes the return of the white collar, which for the first time is a ribbed crew-neck design, and the bottom of the collar has a subtle chevron finish to replicate the pattern used on the chest of United shirts as far back as the early 20th Century, and again in recent times. The button hidden in the collar is unique to the shirt – it's red with a black trim and engraved with the club name. Inside the back of the neck is a small label with the message: "Youth, Courage, Greatness." The words represent the club’s values. On the back of the shirt below the neck is a black devil from the club crest, and across the back is a series of chevrons in engineered mesh to emphasise the importance of the shape to United. The new home kit will be available to pre-order from July 7, and to purchase in stores and from Nike.com from July 16. - See more images of the new United home kit here - All Premier League and top European kits for next season	sports

Ashley Cole greeted by Roma fans at airport ahead of free transfer move to Serie A giants from Chelsea - Telegraph	Cole’s ex-Chelsea and England team-mate Frank Lampard is set to play in the Australian A-League before moving to Major League Soccer in the United States with Manchester City’s New York City franchise. But Cole was adamant that he did not want to finish his career in an inferior league. Cole has signed a two-year contract, with the option of a third year that would take him up to the age of 36 and means Roma is set to be his third and final permanent club. He has the opportunity to keep earning more than £100,000 a week at Roma as long as he plays on a regular basis. Cole, who had his medical at the Pope’s official hospital in Rome, is set to kick off his Roma career against familiar opposition, Liverpool and Manchester United, later this month. After sealing his Roma switch, Cole will join the club on their pre-season tour of the United States and compete in the Guinness International Champions Cup. Roma and Cole face Liverpool at Fenway Park in Boston on July 23, before taking on United at the Sports Authority Field in Denver three days later. In the United clash Cole will go head-to-head with Luke Shaw, who has taken his place in the England squad. Roma also have games scheduled against Real Madrid and Inter Milan in America, before the Serie A season starts. Cole began his career at Arsenal, where he made 228 appearances and won two Premier League titles and the FA Cup three times before controversially joining Chelsea in 2006. During eight years at Stamford Bridge, Cole played 338 times and won the Premier League, the FA Cup on four occasions, the League Cup, the Champions League and the Europa League. Atlético Madrid left-back Filipe Luis has been earmarked as Chelsea’s first-choice replacement for Cole, with Argentina international Marcos Rojo an alternative option. Other than seeing Cole join Roma, Chelsea are also prepared to let reserve left-back Ryan Bertrand leave Stamford Bridge this summer with Liverpool, Tottenham, Southampton and Aston Villa interested. Chelsea return for pre-season training without Cole this week, although the club’s World Cup players will start later. New signing Cesc Fabregas is due to officially begin work with the Blues on July 21, along with fellow Spain international Diego Costa. England international Gary Cahill, who did not make it past the group stages of the World Cup, will return to pre-season training in time for Chelsea’s trip to Austria. Upon his arrival, Roma posted a photo on their official Twitter feed, with the message: "Welcome to Rome, Ashley!".

Brazil v Germany: Team doctor denies report Neymar will have painkilling injection in bid to still play in World Cup - Telegraph	Neymar has been ruled out of the World Cup with a fractured vertebrae, suffered against Colombia, but an article in Globoesporte suggests he is exploring whether it's possible to make a shock return for the final on Sunday, July 13. However, overnight reports have begun to surface claiming that Neymar is considering all avenues to make himself available for the Maracana showpiece in the event of Brazil qualifying. And the player's agent, Eduardo Musa, has added fuel to the fire by refusing to completely rule it out. "The official version is that nobody is thinking about it (injections) right now," he is quoted as saying. This has prompted Globoesporte to run with the headline 'Neymar uses experts to try to play any part of the Final', adding that doctors believe Neymar's fracture was sustained in the best place to have a spinal injury as it causes the minimum harm to the patient. The publication adds that any bid to play on Sunday would involve pain-killing injections, enabling the forward to recover movement, but that injuries of this kind usually result in a recuperation period of 40-45 days. And Globoesporte is not the only Brazilian newspaper to jump on this line, with Folha de Sao Paulo reporting that Neymar has told friends he wants to play after recovering well from the initial injury. Brazil, though, have played down any thoughts of Neymar playing, with the team doctor, Joseph Luiz Runco, saying: "(There is) no chance of him playing the final of the World Cup. He can be with the group, yes, but no chance on the field. No way." - Brazil v Germany: player head-to-head verdicts - Joy, heartbreak and outright terror of penalty shootouts - Ranking the World Cup teams from 1 to 32 - Brazil fail to have Thiago Silva ban lifted - Neymar could not feel his legs and team began to panic	sports
Manchester United reveal new kit for 2014-15 Premier League season - Telegraph	The shirt welcomes the return of the white collar, which for the first time is a ribbed crew-neck design, and the bottom of the collar has a subtle chevron finish to replicate the pattern used on the chest of United shirts as far back as the early 20th Century, and again in recent times. The button hidden in the collar is unique to the shirt – it's red with a black trim and engraved with the club name. Inside the back of the neck is a small label with the message: "Youth, Courage, Greatness." The words represent the club’s values. On the back of the shirt below the neck is a black devil from the club crest, and across the back is a series of chevrons in engineered mesh to emphasise the importance of the shape to United.

Tottenham fail in bid to land Ben Davies and Michel Vorm by offering Swansea City Gylfi Sigurdsson in return - Telegraph	Despite the fact Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins is prepared to play hardball over deals for them, Davies and Vorm will be allowed to leave the Liberty Stadium if the right offer is made. Swansea can replace 21-year-old Davies with Neil Taylor and the club have already signed Lukasz Fabianski on a free transfer to take over first-choice goalkeeping duties from Vorm. Tottenham's interest in Holland international Vorm raises further question marks over the future of goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, despite the club's insistence the Frenchman is not for sale. Lloris has claimed he expects to start the new season with Spurs, but Paris Saint-Germain could yet test Levy's resolve to keep the 27-year-old. Veteran Brad Friedel signed a new one-year contract to stay at Spurs. Re-signing Sigurdsson would help Swansea make up for the anticipated departure of Spanish forward Michu, who has not travelled on the club's pre-season trip to the United States. Napoli have enquired about signing Michu and are keen on an initial loan deal with a view to a permanent transfer. There are also doubts over the future of Swansea winger Pablo Hernandez, who was not expected to travel to the United States.	sports
World Cup 2014: Gonzalo Higuain proves he can be the perfect foil to Lionel Messi for Argentina - Telegraph	The 26-year-old striker scored in Brasilia – and stopped Messi’s clean sweep of man-of-the-match awards – to go some way to countering the powerful argument that Argentina are again a one-man team. Argentina faced that accusation in 1986 in Mexico as well, although Valdano’s contribution, including a goal in the final against West Germany, should not be forgotten, despite the extraordinary way Maradona drove his nation to their last World Cup success. Higuaín, with the hard running and physicality he showed against Belgium, can perform the same role. But he had struggled until then and appeared to owe his place more to a lack of options than his quality. A month off with an ankle injury affected him, as did a poor end to the season with Napoli. But his form and fitness were transformed by his instinctive half-volleyed goal against Belgium. A later effort, clipping the crossbar from distance after a thrilling run and nutmegging Belgium captain Vincent Kompany, showed his confidence had returned. “I had faith in my qualities,” he said afterwards. “I’m already thinking about the semi-final. We have two matches left to make history.” Higuaín’s goal was the first he had scored for the Albiceleste in six appearances. “I was calm and relaxed,” he said. “I knew the goal would come and I was just doing my best for the team. “The goal finally came in an important match and that’s why I’m so emotional. It has been a long time since Argentina were in the semi-finals, so we have to enjoy it. We’ll keep taking things step by step.” Despite Messi’s outstanding performance, in the first half in particular, Argentina’s display was finally a collective effort as they reached their first World Cup semi-final since 1990. “Gonzalo’s confidence is great now he has scored,” defender Pablo Zabaleta said. “He was fantastic on Saturday, one of our best players.”	sports

Dejan Lovren says his head is already at Liverpool after Southampton's broken promises - Telegraph	“Honestly, I don’t know who the main man at the club is any more,” Lovren was quoted on the Croatian website Sportske Novosti. “They are now looking for £25 million, but I don’t think they’ll get it. I’d gladly stay in Southampton if the club had any ambitions, if they kept the key players, not even the Liverpool bid would have dissuaded me. They gave me assurances about the project – the former chairman, Nicola Cortese, and the former coach, Mauricio Pochettino, convinced me. They gave me incredible confidence. “When the chairman left, and Pochettino was going too as early as April, I realised things had fallen apart. Liverpool sent a £20 million offer and Southampton paid £9 million for me, so they would’ve earned twice the amount. “At this point, I don’t know what I’ll do and I don’t like it. It was unbelievable that a few days ago I had an offer of £20 million. It was in the morning and by the afternoon the club had said I was not for sale. Frankly, my head is already at Liverpool. “I found out about the bid from other people which disappointed me and I realised I’ve got no business staying at Southampton. “Liverpool is one of the biggest clubs in the world. Only Real Madrid have as many fans around the world. The last time I played at Anfield, I got chills when I heard You’ll Never Walk Alone. I would like to listen to it all the time.” While Brendan Rodgers seeks defensive reinforcements, Liverpool still have also not given hope of luring Barcelona striker Alexis Sánchez to Anfield and will continue negotiations with the Chile international. That is despite Arsenal believing they are close to finalising his transfer. Confirmation of Luis Suárez’s move to the Nou Camp is being delayed until Liverpool receive a firm decision from Sánchez on his future. The Merseyside club has not been discouraged in its pursuit of the striker, but are ready to move on to alternative targets if they are informed Sanchez is not interested. In those circumstances, negotiations will resume with Barcelona for a straight cash fee for Suárez yielding over £70 million for Rodgers to rebuild his strikeforce. Liverpool are also hoping to finalise a £10 million move for Lille’s Belgium striker Divock Origi following his country’s World Cup exit. Talks will continue this week with Lille willing to negotiate on condition the teenager is loaned back for the forthcoming season. • The top 50 transfer targets this summer • Liverpool closing on fourth signing with Lazar Markovic • Liverpool summer clearout: 14 Reds who could be on their way • Arsenal close in on Bender, Sánchez and Debuchy	sports

Dejan Lovren says his head is already at Liverpool after Southampton's broken promises - Telegraph	“Honestly, I don’t know who the main man at the club is any more,” Lovren was quoted on the Croatian website Sportske Novosti. “They are now looking for £25 million, but I don’t think they’ll get it. I’d gladly stay in Southampton if the club had any ambitions, if they kept the key players, not even the Liverpool bid would have dissuaded me. They gave me assurances about the project – the former chairman, Nicola Cortese, and the former coach, Mauricio Pochettino, convinced me. They gave me incredible confidence. “When the chairman left, and Pochettino was going too as early as April, I realised things had fallen apart. Liverpool sent a £20 million offer and Southampton paid £9 million for me, so they would’ve earned twice the amount. “At this point, I don’t know what I’ll do and I don’t like it. It was unbelievable that a few days ago I had an offer of £20 million. It was in the morning and by the afternoon the club had said I was not for sale. Frankly, my head is already at Liverpool. “I found out about the bid from other people which disappointed me and I realised I’ve got no business staying at Southampton. “Liverpool is one of the biggest clubs in the world. Only Real Madrid have as many fans around the world. The last time I played at Anfield, I got chills when I heard You’ll Never Walk Alone. I would like to listen to it all the time.” While Brendan Rodgers seeks defensive reinforcements, Liverpool still have also not given hope of luring Barcelona striker Alexis Sánchez to Anfield and will continue negotiations with the Chile international. That is despite Arsenal believing they are close to finalising his transfer. Confirmation of Luis Suárez’s move to the Nou Camp is being delayed until Liverpool receive a firm decision from Sánchez on his future. The Merseyside club has not been discouraged in its pursuit of the striker, but are ready to move on to alternative targets if they are informed Sanchez is not interested. In those circumstances, negotiations will resume with Barcelona for a straight cash fee for Suárez yielding over £70 million for Rodgers to rebuild his strikeforce. Liverpool are also hoping to finalise a £10 million move for Lille’s Belgium striker Divock Origi following his country’s World Cup exit. Talks will continue this week with Lille willing to negotiate on condition the teenager is loaned back for the forthcoming season. • The top 50 transfer targets this summer • Liverpool closing on fourth signing with Lazar Markovic • Liverpool summer clearout: 14 Reds who could be on their way • Arsenal close in on Bender, Sánchez and Debuchy	sports

Brazil v Germany: Team doctor denies report Neymar will have painkilling injection in bid to still play in World Cup - Telegraph	Neymar has been ruled out of the World Cup with a fractured vertebrae, suffered against Colombia, but an article in Globoesporte suggests he is exploring whether it's possible to make a shock return for the final on Sunday, July 13. However, overnight reports have begun to surface claiming that Neymar is considering all avenues to make himself available for the Maracana showpiece in the event of Brazil qualifying. And the player's agent, Eduardo Musa, has added fuel to the fire by refusing to completely rule it out. "The official version is that nobody is thinking about it (injections) right now," he is quoted as saying. This has prompted Globoesporte to run with the headline 'Neymar uses experts to try to play any part of the Final', adding that doctors believe Neymar's fracture was sustained in the best place to have a spinal injury as it causes the minimum harm to the patient. The publication adds that any bid to play on Sunday would involve pain-killing injections, enabling the forward to recover movement, but that injuries of this kind usually result in a recuperation period of 40-45 days. And Globoesporte is not the only Brazilian newspaper to jump on this line, with Folha de Sao Paulo reporting that Neymar has told friends he wants to play after recovering well from the initial injury. Brazil, though, have played down any thoughts of Neymar playing, with the team doctor, Joseph Luiz Runco, saying: "(There is) no chance of him playing the final of the World Cup. He can be with the group, yes, but no chance on the field. No way." - Brazil v Germany: player head-to-head verdicts - Joy, heartbreak and outright terror of penalty shootouts - Ranking the World Cup teams from 1 to 32 - Brazil fail to have Thiago Silva ban lifted - Neymar could not feel his legs and team began to panic	sports
World Cup 2014: Gonzalo Higuain proves he can be the perfect foil to Lionel Messi for Argentina - Telegraph	The 26-year-old striker scored in Brasilia – and stopped Messi’s clean sweep of man-of-the-match awards – to go some way to countering the powerful argument that Argentina are again a one-man team. Argentina faced that accusation in 1986 in Mexico as well, although Valdano’s contribution, including a goal in the final against West Germany, should not be forgotten, despite the extraordinary way Maradona drove his nation to their last World Cup success. Higuaín, with the hard running and physicality he showed against Belgium, can perform the same role. But he had struggled until then and appeared to owe his place more to a lack of options than his quality. A month off with an ankle injury affected him, as did a poor end to the season with Napoli. But his form and fitness were transformed by his instinctive half-volleyed goal against Belgium. A later effort, clipping the crossbar from distance after a thrilling run and nutmegging Belgium captain Vincent Kompany, showed his confidence had returned. “I had faith in my qualities,” he said afterwards. “I’m already thinking about the semi-final. We have two matches left to make history.” Higuaín’s goal was the first he had scored for the Albiceleste in six appearances. “I was calm and relaxed,” he said. “I knew the goal would come and I was just doing my best for the team. “The goal finally came in an important match and that’s why I’m so emotional. It has been a long time since Argentina were in the semi-finals, so we have to enjoy it. We’ll keep taking things step by step.” Despite Messi’s outstanding performance, in the first half in particular, Argentina’s display was finally a collective effort as they reached their first World Cup semi-final since 1990. “Gonzalo’s confidence is great now he has scored,” defender Pablo Zabaleta said. “He was fantastic on Saturday, one of our best players.”	sports

Championship club-by-club fixtures 2014-15 - Telegraph	Elsewhere, Leeds - expected to be under the management of former Forest Green man Dave Hockaday - start at Millwall while Sami Hyypia's first game in charge of Brighton is at home to Sheffield Wednesday. Huddersfield host Bournemouth on day one, Birmingham go to Middlesbrough, Stuart Pearce's Nottingham Forest are at home to Blackpool, Watford take on Bolton and Wigan meet Reading. Norwich's first home game - on August 16 - is against Watford, while Cardiff and Fulham's fans first see their men in action against Huddersfield and Millwall respectively. The first East Anglia derby between Ipswich and Norwich is on August 23 at Portman Road - just the fourth game of the season - with the reverse clash on February 28. A Yorkshire derby between Rotherham and Huddersfield stands out on Boxing Day - Steve Evans' Millers having already made a number of big summer signings - while Bolton will take on Blackburn in an all-Lancashire affair. Derby go to Birmingham on the same day, Bournemouth meet Fulham, Ipswich go to Brentford and Brighton are at home to Reading. Charlton and Cardiff have been paired together, as have Leeds and Wigan, with Forest on the road at Middlesbrough, Millwall going to Norwich, Blackpool at Sheffield Wednesday and Watford at home to Wolves. Owing to the way the calendar falls there are no New Year's Day fixtures in the new schedule, so clubs will have to wait until January 10 for their first league outings of 2015. The pick of those fixtures sees Fulham head to Cardiff - a game billed as a six-pointer in the Premier League but did not save City, despite their win - with Brentford and Rotherham renewing rivalries formed in League One. The Easter programme falls on Saturday April 4 and Monday April 6, by which point things should be falling in to place for the sides looking to get up to the top flight. Norwich's Easter comprises of Brighton away and Sheffield Wednesday at home, Cardiff's is made up of Reading away and Bolton at home while Fulham host Brentford and go across London to Charlton. Of the others expected to do well, Derby meet Watford (home) and Wigan (away), with Uwe Rosler's Athletic also travelling to Middlesbrough on the Saturday. The season ends on May 2 with Norwich at home to Fulham in a clash with has the potential to be vital, while Cardiff go to Nottingham Forest, Derby meet Reading and Wigan go to Brentford. Leeds finish against Rotherham, Ipswich at Blackburn, Huddersfield at Blackpool and Bolton are at home to Birmingham. Elsewhere, Charlton meet Bournemouth, Middlesbrough are at home to Brighton, Watford take on Sheffield Wednesday and Wolves and Millwall square up.	sports

Who will illuminate the tournament and join the pantheon alongside Paolo Rossi, Bobby Moore, Pele, Willie Johnston? (And that Zaire player whose grasp of the laws of the game was somewhat sketchy...) But more than that, the answer to the crucial question of how long you will have to wait for each national anthem to be over is revealed - for example, you can not only make a cup of tea during Uruguay's but also a three-course meal, complete a tax return, whistle the Hallelujah Chorus and learn Serbo-Croat.

Investment opportunities: European equities - Telegraph	Investors have long looked to cash and bonds for stability, income and even growth, but in today’s low-interest-rate world the picture is very different. So how can they grow their investment income? For those prepared to take on more risk, part of the solution could be dividend-paying equities (company shares). That typically means owning shares in large, established companies that pay out a regular stream of dividends. These businesses often sell products that people continue to buy even when times are hard, meaning they can still make profits in economic downturns. But where are the best opportunities for this kind of investing? One answer could surprise many: Europe. Inevitably, some investors have been swayed by the headlines, but there is no need to be afraid of Europe. Instead, we feel it’s time for investors to look beyond those headlines to the companies themselves. Europe is home to a large number of high-quality, well-run businesses with significant exposure to global growth. We seek to identify the very best of those, regardless of what industry they are in. For now, we are focusing on those that can pay, and more importantly, sustain high dividends, and those that could grow their dividends in the future. Of course, moving out of cash and government bonds will involve accepting a greater risk of loss to both income and capital. With these traditional solutions no longer delivering what they once did, some investors could look to high-quality European equities as a different way of generating a steady and potentially growing income. All financial investments involve an element of risk to both income and capital. Overseas investments will be affected by movements in currency exchange rates.	sports

Investment opportunities: European equities - Telegraph	Investors have long looked to cash and bonds for stability, income and even growth, but in today’s low-interest-rate world the picture is very different. So how can they grow their investment income? For those prepared to take on more risk, part of the solution could be dividend-paying equities (company shares). That typically means owning shares in large, established companies that pay out a regular stream of dividends. These businesses often sell products that people continue to buy even when times are hard, meaning they can still make profits in economic downturns. But where are the best opportunities for this kind of investing? One answer could surprise many: Europe. Inevitably, some investors have been swayed by the headlines, but there is no need to be afraid of Europe. Instead, we feel it’s time for investors to look beyond those headlines to the companies themselves. Europe is home to a large number of high-quality, well-run businesses with significant exposure to global growth. We seek to identify the very best of those, regardless of what industry they are in. For now, we are focusing on those that can pay, and more importantly, sustain high dividends, and those that could grow their dividends in the future. Of course, moving out of cash and government bonds will involve accepting a greater risk of loss to both income and capital. With these traditional solutions no longer delivering what they once did, some investors could look to high-quality European equities as a different way of generating a steady and potentially growing income. All financial investments involve an element of risk to both income and capital. Overseas investments will be affected by movements in currency exchange rates.	sports

Dani Alves: Germany humiliation will not stain our careers - Goal.com	The defender insists the Brazil players' careers will not be scarred by the embarrassing 7-1 thumping at the hands of Germany in the World Cup semi-final on Tuesday Dani Alves does not believe the Brazil players' careers will be stained by the humiliating 7-1 defeat to Germany in the World Cup semi-final on Tuesday. The hosts were crushed by Joachim Low's side and Alves, who was an unused substitute, insists the Selecao squad is made up of "champions" who will not be remembered for one humbling defeat in Belo Horizonte. "No, I don't believe it is a stain on our careers," Alves told SporTV.  "It won't be stained by a single match, or by the elimination. Our fight, and where we reached, nothing can stain this. "Football isn't just about one match. Competitions are made to compete, to try to go as far as you can. We were eliminated today, but in this group, there are only champions." Meanwhile, midfielder Willian was at a loss to explain how Brazil fell to such a humbling defeat after they conceded five first-half goals to the rampant Germans on the way to the worst defeat in the national team's history. Willian said: "Today is an inexplicable day to all of us. It's one of those inexplicable stories of football. Everything went right for Germany and wrong for us. "Our goal was to make it to the final and go for the title. Unfortunately, we couldn't do it. Every player here has quality, all 11 that Felipao put out there have quality. Nothing went our way, but now we have to raise our heads and life goes on."	sports

Low urges calm after Brazil mauling - Goal.com	The Germany boss insists his side are focused on the final after their 7-1 win, claiming that the margin of victory did not reflect the actual difference between the sides Joachim Low refused to get carried away after Germany's 7-1 thumping of Brazil, insisting his side are already fully focused on the World Cup final. Germany produced a remarkable result on Tuesday, with Toni Kroos and Andre Schurrle scoring twice and Thomas Muller, Miroslav Klose and Sami Khedira all adding to the tally as they stunned the hosts in Belo Horizonte. However, though acknowledging the clinical nature of the display, Low was quick to stress that this was not the time to be carried away with how his team played and even hinted that the size of the victory flattered Germany. "We have great feelings and great emotions, we have won and we will play the final," the 54-year-old told a press conference. "It's a good feeling, now we will have to be humble and prepare well for the final and take the next step. "We know how good the Brazilian team are. It's a big result but doesn't reflect the difference in the two teams. Today was our day and we are happy to be in the final. "They tried to show a reaction at the end and please their fans. There is happiness in the dressing room but we won't be going over the top. "It will be important now for the players to recover, regain their strength. We will remain calm. The team is calm and there is no euphoria in the dressing room. It's going to be difficult in the final, but we will be focused and concentrated on our objective over the next few days." Low also expressed his sympathy with the Selecao, likening their dismal defeat to Germany's semi-final loss to Italy in 2006 when they hosted the tournament. "The Brazilian team were under shock," he continued. "They have magnificent players, but in a semi-final if you get so many goals against you it's very hard. They were getting nervous and playing long balls into our defence. "I think I can imagine what was felt by the Brazilians. In 2006, in our home country, we missed the opportunity to make the final. "It was a big disappointment for us and it's the same for any country. This defeat for Brazil will be difficult to digest. Brazil organised a sensational World Cup, has fantastic, friendly people - and it will be difficult to digest for them." Finally, the Nationalelf boss paid tribute to striker Miroslav Klose, who became the all-time World Cup top scorer with his goal. "What Klose has achieved is something really great, the most goals in the history of the World Cup," he added. "He really deserves it and at his age he is still playing at the highest level. He is still dangerous and still scores goals. The only one who will beat him now is Muller - and that's a great thing for me and for the team."	sports

Netherlands have their own Messi in Robben - Sabella - Goal.com	The Argentina coach is wary of the threat posed by the Bayern Munich winger, who he says is as key for Oranje is as the 27-year-old is for the South Americans Arjen Robben is as important to Netherlands as Lionel Messi is to Argentina, according to Alejandro Sabella. The two stars will come head to head in Sao Paulo in the World Cup semi-finals on Wednesday night as their respective nations battle it out to meet Germany in Sunday’s final. And Sabella insists that Messi remains the better player, but says the Dutch could be just as buoyed by the form of Robben as his own side will be by the four-time Ballon d’Or winner. “He is a very dangerous player when one against one, so we have to pay special attention to him. When he gets a bit of speed up, it is more difficult to take away the ball from him,” Sabella told a press conference on Tuesday. “I think he is a great player, very important for Netherlands, like Neymar is to Brazil or Messi for Argentina. But Messi is the best of them all.” Wednesday’s fixture will represent Argentina’s first World Cup semi-final appearance in 24 years, but Sabella claims there will be no greater pressure on his side than usual. “The pressure is always there. [Getting to the semi-finals] was an extra pressure, I have no doubt. Now it’s a different kind of pressure. “We enjoyed the quarter-final win over Belgium for a short moment, but we have to save energy, the celebrations have to be modest and we have to think about recovering strength because this goes on and it becomes more difficult.” Some have painted the match as an opportunity for Argentina to gain revenge for their quarter-final loss to Netherlands in 1998, but the coach insists there will be no such talk from him. “Those are ugly words, revenge and vengeance, especially vengeance. This is football and those words are not in my dictionary.” The clash at the Arena Corinthians kicks off at 22:00CET on Wednesday.	sports

It's the worst day of my life - Scolari left stunned by Brazil thrashing - Goal.com	The 65-year-old took responsibility for his side's shock semi-final collapse at the hands of Germany, which he described as a defeat of "catastrophic proportions" Brazil boss Luiz Felipe Scolari said he had experienced the worst day of his life after seeing his side lose 7-1 at home to Germany in their World Cup semi-final at Estadio Mineirao on Tuesday. Scolari had claimed prior to the match that his team could cope without the injured Neymar and suspended skipper Thiago Silva, but Brazil soon capitulated against Joachim Low's men and found themselves 5-0 down after half an hour. "It's the worst day of my life," Scolari said after the game. "We ask for forgiveness for the result and we thank the fans for their support even during this defeat." And he added: "I am responsible for the catastrophic result. I made the choices. I am responsible. After the first goal went in we became disorganised and after that it was one goal after another. There was no time to change anything. "This is a loss of catastrophic proportions, it's the worst loss in our history, but we have to learn how to deal with it." Scolari says Neymar's absence had nothing to do with the defeat and admitted that Germany had just been better than his side. "Neymar is one of the team, but he is a striker and he wouldn't have helped us defend those moves," the Brazil boss said. "There's no reason to think it would have been different with Neymar. "Let's not try to find an excuse with Neymar. What happened is that Germany imposed themselves in a few moments which defined the match. Germany made use of those moments and it's nothing to do with Neymar." The 65-year-old now hopes his players can pick themselves up in time for Saturday's match for third and fourth place against either Argentina or Netherlands. "I will have to wait until Saturday to see how they will react," he said. "Before that we will look at this match again to see what went wrong and how we can improve, Life goes on."	sports

Mats Hummels and Toni Kroos call for focus on final after Brazil World Cup thrashing - Goal.com	The Germany defender insists there will be no wild celebrations after their destruction of Brazil and has called on his team-mates to focus quickly on the final Mats Hummels has urged Germany to focus on securing a fourth World Cup, claiming that there will be no overexcitement over beating Brazil. Germany earned an incredible 7-1 win over the tournament hosts in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday, with Toni Kroos and Andre Schurrle scoring twice and Thomas Muller, Miroslav Klose and Sami Khedira adding to the scoresheet before Oscar's consolation. However, Hummels stressed that, since Germany knew they had won the game early on, they experienced a sense of calm at the final whistle and are already fully concentrating on the next fixture. "We think of it now, enjoy it and show our best on Sunday," the 25-year-old defender told reporters. "It was surprisingly quiet. You can also say without being arrogant - we have known for over an hour that we are through and that is different from tight games when you feel high emotion at full-time. "This is really something special, what each individual has done. And we will now try with everything we have to have to make the big dream come true." Toni Kroos echoed the thoughts of his compatriot, stressing that the final was now the sole concern despite the impressive result against the Selecao. "We have played a great game, we have almost overrun them at the beginning," he said. "We have had an incredible game but another game is still waiting. We are here to win the World Cup, we are not yet there."	sports

Thomas Muller hails 'crazy' Brazil thrashing - Goal.com	The Germany forward was ecstatic with his team's semi-final performance as they inflicted a humiliating 7-1 defeat on the World Cup hosts in Belo Horizonte Thomas Muller could not hide his delight with Germany's 7-1 victory over Brazil in the World Cup semi-finals, describing the result as "crazy." Germany launched an onslaught with a flurry on first-half goals, Muller opening the scoring before Miroslav Klose, Sami Khedira and two from Toni Kroos left the hosts trailing 5-0 at half-time. Andre Schurrle added two more after the break and, though Oscar managed to grab a consolation for the Selecao, Muller could not disguise his shock at such a remarkable victory. "Of course, you couldn't expect that," the 24-year-old told ZDF. "That shows how different games can be. Brazil played differently than defensive teams and we took advantage of this in an extraordinary way. It was just crazy." However, as Germany look forward to a final with either Argentina or Netherlands at the Maracana on Sunday, the Bayern Munich forward urged his team-mates not to get carried away. "You should keep a sense of proportion," he continued. "Every match is different. Just like everyone talked us down after the match against Algeria, they will hype us now. We are a squad with big quality, with an awesome team." Muller's words were echoed by Miroslav Klose, whose goal allowed him to surpass Brazil's Ronaldo to become the World Cup's all-time top scorer with 16 - although he abstained from his traditional somersault celebration. "We had a great start," the 36-year-old said. "You can see in training that we can play together. We really are a unit. It is important that set-pieces work, you could see that today again when we scored the first [following a corner]. "Toni [Kroos] passes the ball where it needs to go - that's a real strength. I did no flip [after my goal] because someone kicked my foot when I shot before."	sports
Video: Inspirational sports stories | Alan Smith's footballing heroes - Telegraph	As a schoolboy Smith, now a Sky Sports commentator, seems to have been planning a career in television. “Of course, as a striker I also loved Georgie Best. When I played matches in the park I used to commentate and play at the same time and it was always ‘Oh, that’s a great goal by Georgie Best.’” I can relate to that. In my garden cricket matches I was always Graham Gooch batting. Unfortunately, when I grew up and played as a bowler in professional cricket my batting was more like Graham Norton’s. Smith was a decent all-round sportsman but, faced with a choice of secondary schools, he opted for King’s Norton Grammar, one that played football. “I played for the school and for a Sunday side and got selected for Birmingham County,” he says. “I wasn’t one who got offered schoolboy forms by a professional club. “I was conscientious at school and went on to Coventry Poly to do a modern languages degree. I played for a decent non-League club Alvechurch but was spotted by a Leicester scout and offered a three-year contract.” He had a lucky break when he joined. “As soon as Leicester manager Jock Wallace had signed me, he left to go back to Scotland. Gordon Milne took over, got rid of a number of Scottish players and gave me my chance on the opening day of the season.” Inspired: Alan Smith in his Arsenal heyday Smith struck up an immediate relationship with Gary Lineker. “We dovetailed really well. I preferred playing with my back to goal. He was a predator in front of goal.” This lucrative striking partnership lasted five years until Smith was finally poached by Arsenal. “Gordon Milne helped me a lot. He had played under Bill Shankly at Liverpool and he taught me the rudiments of football. And other than that I have to thank my father. He wasn't an overbearing parent like some who shouted at their sons all the time.

Video: Inspirational sports stories | Alan Smith's footballing heroes - Telegraph	As a schoolboy Smith, now a Sky Sports commentator, seems to have been planning a career in television. “Of course, as a striker I also loved Georgie Best. When I played matches in the park I used to commentate and play at the same time and it was always ‘Oh, that’s a great goal by Georgie Best.’” I can relate to that. In my garden cricket matches I was always Graham Gooch batting. Unfortunately, when I grew up and played as a bowler in professional cricket my batting was more like Graham Norton’s. Smith was a decent all-round sportsman but, faced with a choice of secondary schools, he opted for King’s Norton Grammar, one that played football. “I played for the school and for a Sunday side and got selected for Birmingham County,” he says. “I wasn’t one who got offered schoolboy forms by a professional club. “I was conscientious at school and went on to Coventry Poly to do a modern languages degree. I played for a decent non-League club Alvechurch but was spotted by a Leicester scout and offered a three-year contract.” He had a lucky break when he joined. “As soon as Leicester manager Jock Wallace had signed me, he left to go back to Scotland. Gordon Milne took over, got rid of a number of Scottish players and gave me my chance on the opening day of the season.” Inspired: Alan Smith in his Arsenal heyday Smith struck up an immediate relationship with Gary Lineker. “We dovetailed really well. I preferred playing with my back to goal. He was a predator in front of goal.” This lucrative striking partnership lasted five years until Smith was finally poached by Arsenal. “Gordon Milne helped me a lot. He had played under Bill Shankly at Liverpool and he taught me the rudiments of football. And other than that I have to thank my father. He wasn't an overbearing parent like some who shouted at their sons all the time. He got the balance right.” Smith went on to win two League Championships with Arsenal as well as the FA Cup, the League Cup and UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup, scoring 163 goals in more than 400 appearances.

Thomas Muller hails 'crazy' Brazil thrashing - Goal.com	The Germany forward was ecstatic with his team's semi-final performance as they inflicted a humiliating 7-1 defeat on the World Cup hosts in Belo Horizonte Thomas Muller could not hide his delight with Germany's 7-1 victory over Brazil in the World Cup semi-finals, describing the result as "crazy." Germany launched an onslaught with a flurry on first-half goals, Muller opening the scoring before Miroslav Klose, Sami Khedira and two from Toni Kroos left the hosts trailing 5-0 at half-time. Andre Schurrle added two more after the break and, though Oscar managed to grab a consolation for the Selecao, Muller could not disguise his shock at such a remarkable victory. "Of course, you couldn't expect that," the 24-year-old told ZDF. "That shows how different games can be. Brazil played differently than defensive teams and we took advantage of this in an extraordinary way. It was just crazy." However, as Germany look forward to a final with either Argentina or Netherlands at the Maracana on Sunday, the Bayern Munich forward urged his team-mates not to get carried away. "You should keep a sense of proportion," he continued. "Every match is different. Just like everyone talked us down after the match against Algeria, they will hype us now. We are a squad with big quality, with an awesome team." Muller's words were echoed by Miroslav Klose, whose goal allowed him to surpass Brazil's Ronaldo to become the World Cup's all-time top scorer with 16 - although he abstained from his traditional somersault celebration. "We had a great start," the 36-year-old said. "You can see in training that we can play together. We really are a unit. It is important that set-pieces work, you could see that today again when we scored the first [following a corner]. "Toni [Kroos] passes the ball where it needs to go - that's a real strength. I did no flip [after my goal] because someone kicked my foot when I shot before."	sports
Best World Cup performance ever? Brazil humiliated themselves, not Germany - Goal.com	COMMENT: Germany are receiving all the plaudits after their 7-1 thumping of hosts Brazil in Belo Horizonte. But the truth is that Brazil inflicted this humiliation on themselves By Carlo Garganese Germany’s 7-1 thrashing of Brazil on Tuesday will go down as arguably the most stunning result in World Cup history. World Cup semi-finals are almost always very tight and tense affairs. The last time a last-four clash was won by more than one goal in 90 minutes was 28 years ago when Diego Maradona led Argentina to a 2-0 success over Belgium at Mexico ’86. Before the game, Brazil were marginal favourites – despite losing their two best players, Neymar and Thiago Silva, to injury and suspension respectively. They had not lost a competitive game at home since 1975 and with the whole country behind them it seemed that nothing could stop the Selecao in their quest for a sixth world title. For Germany to not only beat Brazil in their own backyard, but to register one of the highest margins of victory at a World Cup finals is almost impossible to believe. "That was football from another galaxy," gushed DFB president Wolfgang Niersbach. But how much credit do Germany really deserve? Granted, Joachim Low got his tactics spot on with Germany’s pressing and counter-attacking picking Brazil apart time and again. Low must also be praised for swallowing his pride after the second round scare against Algeria and restoring Philipp Lahm to his rightful position at full back. The decision to drop Per Mertesacker further tightened the backline. Germany were ruthless in the attacking third – bringing back memories of the great West German sides of the seventies and eighties when the likes of Gerd Muller, Wolfgang Overath and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge would show opponents no mercy. Thomas Muller and new World Cup record scorer Miroslav Klose certainly fall into a similar category. Hips don't lie | David Luiz had a nightmare in defence alongside Dante But the hard truth is that the reason why Germany inflicted such a humiliation on their hosts was because Brazil were an utter shambles. Sunday League players would be ashamed to perform at such an abominable level. Germany did not have to work for their goals – they were given to them. David Luiz and Dante may as well have been wearing white shirts so embarrassing was their defending on almost all of the seven strikes. Fernandinho gifted Toni Kroos his first goal straight from the restart as if it had been pre-planned. “You have to give Germany credit, but the truth is that it was a woeful, woeful performance from Brazil. In 40 years I have never seen anything like it,” Liverpool legend Alan Hansen, who played against Tele Santana's wonderful Brazil side of Zico, Socrates and Falcao at the 1982 World Cup, told the BBC. Had the Europeans dismantled an outstanding opponent, then they would deserve every superlative thrown their way. But this is the most talentless Brazil team that has ever appeared at a World Cup. A Brazil squad whose two centre-forwards are Fred and Jo. A squad whose right back, Maicon, is so past-it that he is left gasping for breath after the first five minutes. A squad with midfielders, like Ramires and Paulinho, who can't even pass the ball five yards square. A squad containing reserves from QPR, Napoli and Spurs. A squad which includes a host of sub-par players who were picked by Luiz Felipe Scolari solely for personal rather than professional reasons. Die Mannschaft deserve credit for such an historic result, and this golden generation of Bastian Schweinsteiger, Lahm and Klose certainly merits a trophy before they retire, but let’s get real – the big story here is that Brazil were an embarrassment.

Everton sign Gareth Barry from Manchester City - Goal.com	The 33-year-old, who made 37 appearances on loan at Goodison Park last season, has joined on a permanent deal after his contract with the Premier League champions expired Everton have made their first signing of the summer, with Gareth Barry moving to Goodison Park on a three-year deal from Manchester City. The veteran midfielder spent last season on loan with the Toffees where he enjoyed a productive campaign, helping fuel the club's ultimately unsuccessful bid for Champions League football. And Roberto Martinez has opted to sign the 33-year-old permanently after his contract with City came to an end, as the Spaniard aims to bolster his squad to make a renewed charge for the top four this season. "I've learned so much from the boss, it's a great set of players and the fans are fantastic - everything about Everton feels right," said Barry upon completing the transfer. Martinez added: "We all know the type of player Gareth is and the type of person he is. He will fit perfectly well into what we are at Everton." Barry made 175 appearances in all competitions over five years with City, winning the FA Cup and Premier League during his time at Etihad Stadium. The former Aston Villa man has also been capped 53 times for England, though he was overlooked by Roy Hodgson for England's ill-fated World Cup campaign in Brazil.	sports

David Luiz: I am so sorry – I only wanted to make Brazilians happy - Goal.com	The hosts were humiliated as they slumped to a shocking 7-1 defeat to Germany in the World Cup semi-final in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday David Luiz has apologised "to all Brazilians" for the humiliating 7-1 defeat to Germany in the World Cup semi-final in Belo Horizonte. Brazil's dreams of winning the tournament as hosts were smashed as they slumped to an embarrassing defeat. Germany blew Luiz Felipe Scolari's men away as they took a 5-0 lead in the first half before sealing the emphatic 7-1 scoreline after the break. David Luiz, who was named captain in the absence of the suspended Thiago Silva, could only offer an apology at full-time for an abject personal and collective performance. "I just wanted to give some happiness to my people. To my people, who suffer so much already," Luiz told Rede Globo. "Unfortunately we couldn't do it. I'm sorry, everyone. Sorry to all Brazilians. I wanted to see my people smiling. "Everyone knows how important it was for me to make the Brazilian people happy, even if just because of football." Goalkeeper Julio Cesar echoed Luiz's apology and felt the Brazil players became "lost" during a dramatic opening 45 minutes. "I think we got a little lost there and Germany noticed we were like that and managed to score the goals," said Cesar. "I'd rather we had lost 1-0 because of my mistake. “To explain what happened now is complicated. This is a dream that ends, although not the way we hoped. "In my life, I've learned to be a man at all times. I won't shy away from anything, I'll take it on the chin. One day I'll give happiness to those people."	sports

Just like watching Brazil - Famous World Cup humiliations - Goal.com	After the Selecao suffered a chastening capitulation in their semi-final with Germany, Goal takes a look back at teams that have seen similar embarrassment on the World Cup stage By Andrew Wychrij As World Cup hosts, Brazil could be forgiven for struggling to handle the weight of expectation placed on their shoulders in Tuesday's semi-final. However, few would have predicted a remarkable first-half collapse against Germany. Joachim Low's side scored five goals in just 18 minutes on the way to securing a 7-1 win, silencing the Belo Horizonte crowd and ended Brazilian hopes of lifting the trophy for a sixth time. That said, Luiz Felipe Scolari's Selecao are far from the first side to endure the disgrace of a thrashing at international football's most prestigious event. Germany 8-0 Saudi Arabia, 2002 Germany recorded their biggest ever World Cup win with an 8-0 thumping of a desperately poor Saudi Arabia. Miroslav Klose scored a hat-trick, as Michael Ballack, Carsten Jancker, Thomas Linke, Oliver Bierhoff and Bernd Schneider all joined in the rout. Germany had 15 shots on target; their opponents had none. The defeat set the tone for both teams’ tournaments, as Rudi Voller's side went on to be beaten 2-0 in the final by Brazil and the Saudis exited at the group stages after losing to Cameroon and the Republic of Ireland. The 8-0 scoreline represented the worst loss by a team in the World Cup since 1982 and the largest margin of defeat without scoring a goal since 1974. Saudi Arabia’s -12 goal difference was the third worst goal in World Cup history, equalling El Salvador’s showing in 1982. Head coach Nasser Al Johar was sacked following the tournament. Hungary 8-3 West Germany, 1954 From 1950, Hungary boss Gusztav Sebes instilled a ruthless streak in the Magyars' game. Their attacking 3-2-1-4 formation saw them play 50 games between 1950 and 1956, winning 42, drawing 7 and losing just once. Hungary had begun their World Cup campaign in Switzerland with a 9-0 defeat of South Korea and found West Germany barely more of a contest in their second game. The Mighty Magyars lived up to their formidable reputation by thrashing an admittedly unseeded and weakened West German side. Sandor Kocsis scored four, ending the World Cup as top scorer with eleven, Nandor Hidegkuti got two and Ferenc Puskas and Jozsef Toth added the remainder. Hungary have long held a place in the pantheon of the greatest teams to ever play the game and demonstrated that in Switzerland, only blemishing that impression with a defeat in the final to the previously vanquished West Germany. West Germany 6-1 Austria, 1954 After wobbling against Hungary, West Germany only managed to escape the group stages after a 7-2 play-off win over Turkey. However, Sepp Herberger’s side had apparently been rejuvenated after their earlier humiliation. Following a 2-0 defeat of Yugoslavia in the quarter-finals, the West Germans turned their attention to their neighbours Austria and dished out an impressive display. Inspired by Max Morlock, they completed a reversal in fortunes by scoring six with Hans Schafer, Ottmar Walter, two penalties from Fritz Walter and one from Morlock himself. They progressed to the final where it appeared that the Hungarians were an unstoppable force en route to the Jules Rimet trophy. However, West Germany triumphed against their illustrious opponents, despite being 2-0 down after only eight minutes. The ‘Miracle of Bern’ as the game came to be known saw a historic 3-2 turnaround as the West Germans won their first ever World Cup. Yugoslavia 9-0 Zaire, 1974 Zaire entered the World Cup in West Germany with high hopes. Promoted and bankrolled by Zairean dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, the Leopards were African Cup of Nations champions and the first sub-Saharan side to make it to the prestigious arena of the World Cup. However, after an opening 2-0 defeat to Scotland, Zaire conspired to put in an awful display. 3-0 down after less than 20 minutes, an ignoble loss was likely to be on the cards. Dusan Bajevic starred as he grabbed three goals for the Blues and consigned the team coached by his fellow countryman, Blagoje Vidinic, to a heavy loss in Gelsenkirchen. Zaire’s miserable tournament was brought to an end after a 3-0 defeat to Brazil, leaving them without a point, without a goal and a goal difference of -14, an all-time low that only South Korea’s -16 in 1954 have managed to do worse than. Zaire’s 1974 remains a low point for African football in the tournament. On the face of it, Argentina’s 6-0 thumping of Peru in 1978 could be heralded as one of the most incredible results in the tournament’s history. The reality, however, was considerably murkier. The Peruvians were reigning Copa America champions and the Albiceleste needed an improbable 4-0 win to reach a World Cup final on home soil. The second-round game in Rosario saw them surpass even that milestone. Mario Kempes and Leopoldo Luque scored twice and Alberto Tarantini and Rene Houseman grabbed one each as the South Americans sealed a miraculous victory on the way to defeating the Netherlands in the final. Far from being regarded as a humbling defeat, the game is a far more serious humiliation amid accusations that Argentinian dictator Jorge Videla and Peru’s then-president Francisco Bermudez had struck a deal. The game has been mired in controversy ever since, considered by some as the World Cup’s biggest ever fix.	sports
Brazil 1-7 Germany - the records broken - Goal.com	It proved to be a record-breaking night in Belo Horizonte as the host nation were humiliated by Joachim Low's men Germany's extraordinary 7-1 humiliation of Brazil in Tuesday's World Cup semi-final saw a number of records broken by both sides. Here, Goal picks over some of the feats from the astonishing fixture in Belo Horizonte... - The biggest-ever winning margin in a World Cup semi-final. The previous best were Argentina's 6-1 victory over the USA, Uruguay's 6-1 triumph versus Yugoslavia in 1930 and West Germany's 6-1 win against Austria in 1954. - Brazil equalled their biggest-ever margin of defeat. Their previous heaviest loss was 6-0 to Uruguay in the 1920 Copa America. - Brazil conceded 11 goals at World Cup 2014, equalling the number they shipped in 1938. - Brazil's first home defeat in a competitive match since 1975 when they lost 3-1 to Peru in the Copa America semi-finals. - The first time Brazil had ever conceded seven in a World Cup match. They have only conceded more once in any fixture, an 8-4 loss to Yugoslavia in a friendly in 1934. - Miroslav Klose became the leading scorer in World Cup finals. His goal was his 16th, one more than former Brazil striker Ronaldo. - Klose also became the first man ever to play in four World Cup semi-finals. - Klose has been on the winning side 16 times at the World Cup, equalling the record set by former Brazil full-back Cafu. - Thomas Muller's goal was Germany's 2000th in all matches played. Fritz Becker got their first in 1908.	sports

Brazil 1-7 Germany - the records broken - Goal.com	It proved to be a record-breaking night in Belo Horizonte as the host nation were humiliated by Joachim Low's men Germany's extraordinary 7-1 humiliation of Brazil in Tuesday's World Cup semi-final saw a number of records broken by both sides. Here, Goal picks over some of the feats from the astonishing fixture in Belo Horizonte... - The biggest-ever winning margin in a World Cup semi-final. The previous best were Argentina's 6-1 victory over the USA, Uruguay's 6-1 triumph versus Yugoslavia in 1930 and West Germany's 6-1 win against Austria in 1954. - Brazil equalled their biggest-ever margin of defeat. Their previous heaviest loss was 6-0 to Uruguay in the 1920 Copa America. - Brazil conceded 11 goals at World Cup 2014, equalling the number they shipped in 1938. - Brazil's first home defeat in a competitive match since 1975 when they lost 3-1 to Peru in the Copa America semi-finals. - The first time Brazil had ever conceded seven in a World Cup match. They have only conceded more once in any fixture, an 8-4 loss to Yugoslavia in a friendly in 1934. - Miroslav Klose became the leading scorer in World Cup finals. His goal was his 16th, one more than former Brazil striker Ronaldo. - Klose also became the first man ever to play in four World Cup semi-finals. - Klose has been on the winning side 16 times at the World Cup, equalling the record set by former Brazil full-back Cafu. - Thomas Muller's goal was Germany's 2000th in all matches played. Fritz Becker got their first in 1908.	sports
For Big Phil, read Big Flop: How could a respected coach get it so wrong? - Goal.com	COMMENT: The Brazil boss must take responsibility for what is probably the most embarrassing defeat in the nation's entire history, eclipsing even the Maracanazo By Ben Hayward in Belo Horizonte When Argentina lost 4-0 to Germany at the 2010 World Cup, Diego Maradona was accused of a naive tactical approach against one of the strongest sides in the competition. But what happened to Brazil at home to Joachim Low's men on Tuesday night was much, much worse. Everything that could go wrong did go wrong and for all the Brazilian bravado about being able to cope without their two best players, the starting XI looked decidedly ordinary sans Neymar and Thiago Silva. For all the talk of Brazil's quality in defence, their back line was picked apart at will. The first goal was a gift as awful marking allowed Thomas Muller to arrive late and score from a corner. With Thiago Silva in the side, that may never have happened, but the captain was out after picking up a needless yellow card against Colombia. Not even he could have imagined how costly that would be. In his absence, Dante came in alongside David Luiz, but the back line were defending far too high up the pitch. With Neymar, Scolari had seemed content for his team to defend deep and attack on the break. But against Germany, they played a high line which was easily exploited by Low's attackers, while huge holes in the midfield allowed the Europeans the freedom of the Mineirao pitch. What's going on? | Brazil in disbelief as Germany celebrate Brazilian fans watched in shock and horror as 0-1 became 0-2, 0-3, 0-4 and 0-5 in the space of six minutes. Disbelief turned to depression inside Belo Horizonte's superb stadium; with less than half an hour gone, Brazil's dreams of lifting the World Cup at home were in tatters. The players left the pitch amid a chorus of jeers at half-time and whatever Scolari said at the break, it had some impact as Brazil began brightly. But beating Manuel Neuer proved much more difficult than finding a way past Julio Cesar and the Bayern keeper made two superb saves to deny the home team. Brazil's revival didn't last long anyway as substitute Andre Schurrle made it six and then seven, before a late consolation from Oscar which still received the biggest cheer of the night - probably pent-up tension and anger. But this was a reverse of epic proportions, a loss to replace the Maracanazo in the history of the Selecao's most damaging defeats. A Mineirazo. And it's all down to Scolari. The Brazil boss must take the blame for most of what went wrong. Ask any Brazilian to name the nation's best goalkeeper and very few will say Julio Cesar, a player recently struggling at QPR. Then there was the absence of Atletico Madrid's in-form defender Joao Miranda and the clumsy handling of the Diego Costa case which saw Brazil lose perhaps their one world-class centre-forward to Spain. With Neymar out, Ronaldinho would have been useful too - even at the age of 34. He is a player who can provide a spark out of nothing - and Brazil have very few of those right now. The five-man midfield was woeful as Oscar dropped deep and was unable to get the ball, Hulk lost possession and added little defensively, while Bernard did absolutely nothing to show why Scolari had chosen him to stand in for Neymar. Paulinho, meanwhile, looks a million miles from the player who shone last summer in the Confederations Cup. In terms of personnel, in terms of tactics and in terms of man-management, Scolari got it all wrong. Brazil buckled under the psychological pressure of playing a World Cup at home and Felipao had called on the help of a psychologist as his footballers frequently broke down in tears, burdened by the immense weight of a nation's hopes and dreams. Tomorrow they will need the psychologist's help and so, quite probably, will their coach after the saddest possible ending to a World Cup they were supposed to win. Follow Ben Hayward on	sports

Maradona: I learned a lot from 'maestro' Di Stefano - Goal.com	The Argentina great has joined the chorus of praise for his late compatriot, revealing the deep impression that the legendary footballer made on his own career Diego Maradona has paid tribute to Alfredo Di Stefano, hailing the Real Madrid icon's impact upon his own career. The 88-year-old Argentinian, who passed away on Monday following cardiac arrest, enjoyed a glittering career in football, winning eight La Liga titles and five European Cups in 11 seasons with los Blancos. Maradona spent two seasons at Madrid's great rivals Barcelona, who had initially claimed to have signed Di Stefano when he arrived in Spain in 1953, and the former forward revealed how influential his  compatriot had been on his own career. "For me he was a maestro, he taught me a lot," the 53-year-old said on Telesur programme 'De Zurda'. "I remember a lot of great moments of his and truthfully football today is grieving because a great died today, not just a player, but a person. He was a terrific person." The Argentina national side also lamented the passing of the great forward, who played six times for the Albiceleste as well as twice for Colombia and 31 times with Spain. "Whilst I didn't see him play, my father and grandfather spoke about Alfredo and his play a lot," Javier Mascherano said. "He was a gift to world football, and without doubt we will miss him a lot. He did so much for this sport, and all that he left means he is a true legend." Gonzalo Higuain echoed his team-mate's sentiments in hailing one of the greatest players of all time. "He helped me a lot when I was younger and arrived in Madrid," the Napoli striker said. "He was always close and treated me brilliantly. I can't say any more about my thanks and how much his passing hurts. He deserves all the demonstrations of warmth that the world of football is paying him."	sports

Brazil 1 - 7 Germany Match report - Goal.com	The veteran striker broke Ronaldo's record for finals goals as Thomas Muller, Sami Khedira, Toni Kroos and Andre Schurrle combined to decimate Luiz Felipe Scolari's side Germany have reached the World Cup final after they annihiliated hosts  Brazil 7-1 in their semi-final clash in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday. Shorn of injured playmaker Neymar, who suffered a fractured vertebra in the quarter-final against Colombia, and suspended captain Thiago Silva, Brazil were torn apart by a ruthless Germany at Estadio Mineirao. Miroslav Klose became the leading scorer in World Cup finals history as Joachim Low's side scored four goals in the space of six first-half minutes and led 5-0 after only 29 minutes, then struck twice in the second half to set up a final against either Netherlands or Argentina at the Maracana on Sunday. Thomas Muller set the ball rolling with his fifth of the tournament and veteran striker Klose netted his 16th World Cup goal, surpassing legendary Brazil striker Ronaldo's tally as the shell-shocked Selecao were totally outclassed. Brazil had no answer to Germany's passing and movement as Toni Kroos struck twice and Sami Khedira added a fifth before substitute Andre Schurrle scored twice in the second half as the hosts were totally humiliated in the most emphatic semi-final win in World Cup history. Oscar pulled back a late goal on the break, but it was no consolation on a miserable night for Brazil. Germany were a class apart and Brazil fans sportingly applauded as they became the first team to score seven goals in a World Cup semi-final and will take some beating as they attempt to win the trophy for the first time since 1990, while the inquest will now start for the home nation. The hosts started brightly against Colombia in the quarter-finals, but looked nervous early on and Germany took full advantage when Muller put them in front just 11 minutes in courtesy of some dreadful defending. It was all too straightforward for the Bayern Munich forward, who side-footed home after being left unmarked from an outswinging Kroos corner. Brazil looked disjointed as they gave the ball away far too easily, while Germany were playing with a swagger and doubled their lead with a landmark Klose goal after 23 minutes. Muller was involved once again, as he cut in from the right and laid the ball off for Klose after being picked out by an incisive Kroos pass. The veteran striker slotted into the corner with his right foot after Julio Cesar had kept out his initial attempt. Luiz Felipe Scolari's men were stunned, but far worse was to come as Germany capitalised on more shambolic defending to score another three goals in the space of five minutes. First, Kroos was on hand to fire home with his left foot from 18 yards after Muller had failed to make contact with a Philipp Lahm pass, then the midfielder struck again almost straight from the kick-off as Brazil fell apart. The Bayern Munich man robbed Fernandinho as he dithered in possession and laid the ball off for Khedira, who unselfishly cut it back for his fellow midfielder to net. And the outstanding Khedira got in on the act by adding a fifth with only 29 minutes gone, driving forward and passing to Mesut Ozil and then finishing with his right foot after the Arsenal midfielder cut the ball back to him inside the penalty area.   Scolari replaced Fernandinho and Hulk with Paulinho and Ramires at half-time and both substitutes were in the thick of the action early in the second half as they brought saves out of Manuel Neuer. But normal service was resumed as Germany showed no mercy and Cesar produced a fine save to tip over Muller's goal-bound striker on the hour mark. Cesar could do nothing to deny substitute Schurrle a sixth goal 69 minutes in, though, and once again it was all too easy as Lahm fed Khedira, who in turn picked out the Chelsea forward and he made no mistake with a simple finish. And Schurrle put Germany in seventh heaven with a clinical left-foot finish at the near post 11 minutes from time that prompted Brazil fans to sportingly applaud despite their heartbreak. Oscar pulled a goal back when he cut inside Jerome Boateng and finished a minute from time, but the damage had long since been done.	sports

Miroslav Klose breaks Ronaldo World Cup goal record - Goal.com	The 36-year-old has written a new piece of football history after surpassing the Brazil legend's tally of 15 World Cup goals Miroslav Klose has become the top goalscorer in World Cup history after scoring in Germany's semi-final against Brazil on Tuesday. The 36-year-old struck in the first half against the host nation, tapping home from point-blank range after Julio Cesar had denied him at the first attempt.    Name       Goals       Miroslav Klose 16 Ronaldo 15  Gerd Muller 14  Just Fontaine 13 Pele 12  Sandor Kocsis 11  Jurgen Klinsmann 11  Helmut Rahn 10  Gary Lineker 10  Gabriel Batistuta 10  Since his last World Cup in 2006, Ronaldo's record tally of 15 goals in the competition had remained untouched, but Klose has now surpassed that tally at last in his fourth tournament. The Lazio striker netted five goals at the 2002 World Cup, five times four years later, four in 2010 and now twice during this summer's showpiece. Ronaldo amassed his strikes across three tournaments, in 1998, 2002 and 2006 - and lifted the famous trophy once along the way, 12 years ago this summer. Klose, 36, started the tournament level on goals with compatriot, Gerd Muller, who starred in the 1970 and 1974 tournaments and boasts an incredible ratio of 1.08 goals per World Cup games. Klose, who was born in Poland, made his Germany debut as a substitute on March 24, 2011 and marked the occasion with a goal. He struck again against Greece just four days later - despite being afforded just 33 minutes over the course of his first two international outings - and the goals just never stopped coming, particularly in major tournaments.	sports

Miranda quashes Atletico Madrid exit talk - Goal.com	The defender has dismissed rumours linking him with Barcelona and the Premier League, while team-mate Filipe Luis has refused to rule out a possible exit Miranda has insisted he has no desire to leave Atletico Madrid this summer, despite rumours about a possible transfer. The Brazilian centre-half has been linked with Manchester United and Barcelona in the current transfer window, with both clubs known to be keen to bolster their defensive options. However, it appears that the 29-year-old, who made 32 league appearances as Atletico clinched their first Liga crown since 1996 last season, will remain at Vicente Calderon. "Don't worry, I'm staying," he was quoted as saying by Marca, despite previously claiming to have received offers from Premier League and La Liga sides. However, while Miranda appears to be content to remain with Atletico, Filipe Luis, who has been linked with a move to Chelsea as long-term replacement for new Roma signing Ashley Cole, was less certain on his own future. "We'll see what happens," the 28-year-old said when asked if he was likely to leave. Atletico enjoyed a hugely successful campaign last term, ending the season as La Liga champions as well as beaten Champions League finalists following a 4-1 defeat to Real Madrid in Lisbon.	sports

Aurier plays down Arsenal links but admits Premier League move would be a 'dream' - Goal.com	The Cote d'Ivoire international says reports that he has signed for the Gunners are "not true" but remains interested in a move to England or Paris Saint-Germain Serge Aurier insists he has not agreed to sign for Arsenal but admits he would love to move to England. The Cote d'Ivoire international, who impressed in the World Cup despite his country's group stage elimination, was identified by Arsene Wenger as a potential replacement for Bacary Sagna and last month talks with Toulouse over a €9 million deal reached an advanced stage. However, he has now revealed that there is no deal with the north Londoners – who are set to land Mathieu Debuchy from Newcastle – though he says the Premier League is his favourite. "I've been told that I had already signed with Arsenal. That is not true," he told Foot Mercato. "All I can say is that the Premier League is the league I enjoy the most. Things are clear. I've always given my preference to England. But I've not given any sort of agreement to anyone. So I'm free to discuss with any club." Despite admitting that it would be a "dream" to play in the Premier League, Aurier is keeping his options open and claims a move to Paris Saint-Germain or Monaco could be on the cards should he leave Toulouse. "To play in England is a dream, but sometimes, dreams do not come true," he added. "So if PSG or Monaco are interested, I can't neglect them. They should see my people and we'll see from there. If ever a transfer occurs, I want a club that can guarantee me playing time. "I've heard of the interest of PSG. It's a great club, one the best in Europe today. It's one of the top eight clubs today and it's interesting to see that a club who can buy anybody is interested in me. And I'm Parisian, this undoubtedly matters. "But I leave this issue to be handled by the competent people that I have with me."	sports

Cristiano Ronaldo pays tribute to late grandmother, Filomena Aveira - Goal.com	The Portugal captain has taken to social media to post a message in memory of Filomena Aveiro, who has passed away upon his return from the World Cup Real Madrid and Portugal star Cristiano Ronaldo has used social media to leave a touching message to his grandmother, who passed away on Tuesday. Filomena Aveira, who was 87, died shortly after Ronaldo's return from the World Cup in Brazil, where his Portugal side endured an ignominious exit from the group stage. The 29-year-old, who is currently on holiday following elimination from the tournament, took to his Twitter page to announce the death of his grandmother and leave a heart-felt tribute on Tuesday. "Grandmother, you will always be in my heart," the former Manchester United attacker wrote. "Rest in peace. Kisses from all your grandchildren." The tweet was accompanied by a photo of him and his son, Cristiano Ronaldo Junior, taken with Filomena some weeks before.	sports

I'll leave Van Persie decision as late as possible - Van Gaal - Goal.com	The Dutch coach has insisted he will make no snap judgements on the forward's availability after the striker sat out training on Tuesday Louis van Gaal insists he will wait on the fitness of Robin van Persie for as long as possible after the Netherlands striker trained alone on the eve of the World Cup semi-final against Argentina. The Manchester United star and full-back Daryl Janmaat both reported stomach upsets on Tuesday, with Van Gaal leaving both to train separately as a precautionary measure. And the Dutch coach says he will make a final decision on striker Van Persie in particular on Wednesday, just hours before the game at the Arena Corinthians in Sao Paulo. “Van Persie had some intestinal problems so it was best he didn’t train today,” Van Gall told a press conference. “I don’t know if he will be 100 per cent. I will have to take these decisions tomorrow. We have more than a day to go and Van Persie is a very important player to us. “He is our captain, so in that capacity alone he is very important, and in principle my captains always play.” The fitness of Van Persie and Janmaat are not the only reasons for concern for Van Gaal, with defender Ron Vlaar short of fitness and midfielder Nigel de Jong looking to make a shock early return from a thigh injury which had looked set to end his World Cup. “De Jong tried out today and we will have to wait and see how it looks tomorrow,” Van Gaal admitted. “If you want to return to the pitch so quickly there has to be a reaction. We will see how he reacts. Vlaar is the same. We’ll wait and see.” Much has been said about Lionel Messi in the build-up to the crunch clash, with the Barcelona star expected to be the main man for Alejandro Sabella’s Argentina side. But Van Gaal insists that while he will prepare his side to step Messi, the Albiceleste have many more players with which they could cause his side damage. “Messi was once elected the best football player in the world, and that’s not for nothing,” he added. “At the highest stage he can always pull it off. “In principle, he has always found it rather difficult to repeat that at national level and he wants to show he can do that. We need to stop him doing it. “But we are playing against Argentina, we always refer to teams not to individuals. We showed the players some things on Argentina this morning, but I need to see how they will play and with which players before deciding exactly how we will play.” The semi-final kicks off at 22:00CET on Wednesday, with the winners going on to play Brazil or Germany in Sunday’s final at the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro.	sports

Prandelli: Balotelli not yet a champion - Goal.com	The former Italy coach has also taken a swipe at Giuseppe Rossi "as a man" and revealed that he and his family have been subjected to death threats Former Italy coach Cesare Prandelli believes that Mario Balotelli still has some way to go before he can be considered a true "champion". The AC Milan foward netted the winner in the Azzurri's World Cup opener against England but disappointed in their subsequent defeats to Costa Rica and Uruguay. Even Prandelli appeared to lose patience with Balotelli in Brazil, hauling the forward off at half-time in the latter loss, and he has now admitted that he feels the 23-year-old still has so much to prove. "For now he only has great shots, but he's not yet a champion," the new Galatasaray boss told reporters at his official unveiling on Tuesday. "He must work to become one." Prandelli also took a swipe at Giuseppe Rossi, who lashed out publicly at the coach following his omission from Italy's World Cup squad. "Giuseppe Rossi is the one who disappointed me the most, as a man more than as a player,” the former Fiorentina boss stated. Meanwhile, Prandelli revealed that he and his family have been subjected to death threats in the wake of the Azzurri's shock first-round elimination in Brazil and admitted that he has been taken aback by the severity of some of the criticism he received from the media just two years after leading Italy to the final of Euro 2012. "We are receiving numerous letters from so-called supporters,” Prandelli lamented. “I decided to resign and not to ask for any bonus from the Italian FA, and I promised myself not to train any Italian team, at least for the moment. "During the World Cup there were maybe some players who were frightened by the pressure, but the group was solid, not devastated as someone reported. “Being compared to Schettino [the infamous Costa Concordia captain, who left the ship while sinking] was the thing that hurt me the most."	sports

Southampton sign Tadic from FC Twente - Goal.com	The 25-year-old has signed a four-year deal at St Mary's and becomes Ronald Koeman's first signing, following the departures of the likes of Luke Shaw and Adam Lallana Southampton have signed Serbia international Dusan Tadic from FC Twente, the club have announced. The winger has signed a four-year deal at the club and becomes manager Ronald Koeman's first signing at St Mary's. Southampton have seen Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert leave the club in this transfer window and are expected to significantly strengthen as a result of the departures, with Tadic the first step towards rebuilding their squad. The 25-year-old enjoyed a stunning season for Twente in 2013-14, scoring 16 goals and providing 14 assists in 33 Eredivisie appearances. Upon completing his move, he told Southampton's official website: “It is a really nice feeling to sign. This is a really nice club of which I have heard a lot of good things about. “I have already seen the beautiful training centre and there are lots of nice people that work here including the coaches so I am really happy to be here. “I watched a lot of [Southampton’s] games last season and saw that the club plays really nice football which will suit me because I like to play in the same way.   “The manager obviously knows me from the Dutch league so, when he called me and told me his plan, it was an easy decision to make. “I know the manager well because he is one of the biggest Dutch legends in football – everyone knows him. He is a really good coach and you can always expect his teams to play well because he is leading them and because he is so good tactically. I am really excited to start playing for the club." And Koeman also hailed the signing, and hinted at further moves in the close-season. “It was very important to get this signing done – not only for me, but for the rest of the squad and for our fans," the Dutchman added. "It’s fantastic news. “We’ve lost some good players but we want to continue the ambition and philosophy of the club, so it’s a great signal to have brought in our first player. “He’s a great player. I know him very well from Holland, where he had a great season last year. “We now look forward to bringing in more players because we want to continue and maybe even better what Southampton did last season.”	sports
World Cup is a homosexual abomination - Russian priest - Goal.com	Alexander Shumsky, a Christianity figure, has controversially slammed the haircuts and multi-coloured boots adorned by players in Brazil this summer The World Cup is "a homosexual abomination", according to one angry Russian priest, who says male footballers may as well wear women's underwear and bras. Orthodox Christianity religious figure Alexander Shumsky came out with the controversial stance against the biggest single event sporting competition as it reaches the semi-final stage. Although most people might see the different types and colours of boots adorned by footballers as a good variety, Shumsky slammed the choice of footwear and claims that liberals are trying to drown traditional Christianity with football. "Wearing pink and blue shoes is like wearing women's underwear or wearing a bra," he ranted on Christian website Russian People's Line. "The liberal ideology of globalisation is opposed to Christian values with football. I'm sure of it." The pink and blue boots which Shumsky is referring to are PUMA Tricks, which were released shortly before the tournament and were worn in South American this summer by the likes of Italy's Mario Balotelli, Spain's Cesc Fabregas and Brazil's Dante. Russia, coached by Fabio Capello, were unable to scrape out of Group H and were sent packing early in the tournament but Shumsky is delighted that his compatriots made a swift exit. "I am glad that Russia were eliminated and, by God's grace, no longer participate in this homosexual abomination that is the World Cup." The Russian priest even took offence at footballers' haircuts, branding them "unthinkable" during his controversial rant. Fifa will be hoping that Shumsky represents a tiny minority of Russians as the nation will be hosting the World Cup in four years' time.	sports
M'Vila: I only want to join Inter - Goal.com	The 24-year-old's loan switch has been held up by red tape but he has reassured Nerazzurri fans that there is no chance of him being tempted by late offers from elsewhere Yann M'Vila has revealed that he has his heart set on move to Inter and that the only thing he is lacking is Rubin Kazan's formal permission to join the Serie A side. The French midfielder only joined the Russian outfit last season but a deal has been agreed that will see him join the Nerazzurri on loan for the 2014-15 campaign, with the option of a permanent switch next summer. M'Vila has already undergone a medical in Milan but is now just awaiting the return of official documentation from Rubin to complete the move and insisted that there is no chance of him changing his mind or being tempted by 11th-hour offers from elsewhere.

Prandelli: Balotelli not yet a champion - Goal.com	The former Italy coach has also taken a swipe at Giuseppe Rossi "as a man" and revealed that he and his family have been subjected to death threats Former Italy coach Cesare Prandelli believes that Mario Balotelli still has some way to go before he can be considered a true "champion". The AC Milan foward netted the winner in the Azzurri's World Cup opener against England but disappointed in their subsequent defeats to Costa Rica and Uruguay. Even Prandelli appeared to lose patience with Balotelli in Brazil, hauling the forward off at half-time in the latter loss, and he has now admitted that he feels the 23-year-old still has so much to prove. "For now he only has great shots, but he's not yet a champion," the new Galatasaray boss told reporters at his official unveiling on Tuesday. "He must work to become one." Prandelli also took a swipe at Giuseppe Rossi, who lashed out publicly at the coach following his omission from Italy's World Cup squad. "Giuseppe Rossi is the one who disappointed me the most, as a man more than as a player,” the former Fiorentina boss stated. Meanwhile, Prandelli revealed that he and his family have been subjected to death threats in the wake of the Azzurri's shock first-round elimination in Brazil and admitted that he has been taken aback by the severity of some of the criticism he received from the media just two years after leading Italy to the final of Euro 2012. "We are receiving numerous letters from so-called supporters,” Prandelli lamented. “I decided to resign and not to ask for any bonus from the Italian FA, and I promised myself not to train any Italian team, at least for the moment. "During the World Cup there were maybe some players who were frightened by the pressure, but the group was solid, not devastated as someone reported. “Being compared to Schettino [the infamous Costa Concordia captain, who left the ship while sinking] was the thing that hurt me the most."	sports
World Cup is a homosexual abomination - Russian priest - Goal.com	Alexander Shumsky, a Christianity figure, has controversially slammed the haircuts and multi-coloured boots adorned by players in Brazil this summer The World Cup is "a homosexual abomination", according to one angry Russian priest, who says male footballers may as well wear women's underwear and bras. Orthodox Christianity religious figure Alexander Shumsky came out with the controversial stance against the biggest single event sporting competition as it reaches the semi-final stage. Although most people might see the different types and colours of boots adorned by footballers as a good variety, Shumsky slammed the choice of footwear and claims that liberals are trying to drown traditional Christianity with football. "Wearing pink and blue shoes is like wearing women's underwear or wearing a bra," he ranted on Christian website Russian People's Line. "The liberal ideology of globalisation is opposed to Christian values with football. I'm sure of it." The pink and blue boots which Shumsky is referring to are PUMA Tricks, which were released shortly before the tournament and were worn in South American this summer by the likes of Italy's Mario Balotelli, Spain's Cesc Fabregas and Brazil's Dante. Russia, coached by Fabio Capello, were unable to scrape out of Group H and were sent packing early in the tournament but Shumsky is delighted that his compatriots made a swift exit. "I am glad that Russia were eliminated and, by God's grace, no longer participate in this homosexual abomination that is the World Cup." The Russian priest even took offence at footballers' haircuts, branding them "unthinkable" during his controversial rant. Fifa will be hoping that Shumsky represents a tiny minority of Russians as the nation will be hosting the World Cup in four years' time.	sports

This is a really nice club of which I have heard a lot of good things about. “I have already seen the beautiful training centre and there are lots of nice people that work here including the coaches so I am really happy to be here. “I watched a lot of [Southampton’s] games last season and saw that the club plays really nice football which will suit me because I like to play in the same way.   “The manager obviously knows me from the Dutch league so, when he called me and told me his plan, it was an easy decision to make. “I know the manager well because he is one of the biggest Dutch legends in football – everyone knows him. He is a really good coach and you can always expect his teams to play well because he is leading them and because he is so good tactically. I am really excited to start playing for the club." And Koeman also hailed the signing, and hinted at further moves in the close-season. “It was very important to get this signing done – not only for me, but for the rest of the squad and for our fans," the Dutchman added. "It’s fantastic news. “We’ve lost some good players but we want to continue the ambition and philosophy of the club, so it’s a great signal to have brought in our first player. “He’s a great player. I know him very well from Holland, where he had a great season last year. “We now look forward to bringing in more players because we want to continue and maybe even better what Southampton did last season.”	sports

Scholes: I can't wait for Van Gaal to take over at Manchester United - Goal.com	The former midfielder believes the 62-year-old has "a bit of genius about him" and insists the Dutchman will significantly improve his new club's displays after a "shocking season" Paul Scholes believes Louis van Gaal's "Midas touch" will help Manchester United's recovery from a dreadful 2013-14 Premier League campaign. The 62-year-old was named as David Moyes' successor in May and will take charge at Old Trafford following Netherlands' participation in this summer's World Cup in Brazil. The Dutch face Argentina on Wednesday evening for a spot in the final and the former midfielder insists Van Gaal will need to be at his best after United's "shocking season". “Right now, Manchester United fans (and myself) cannot wait for Louis van Gaal to get the job started at Old Trafford,” Scholes wrote in an exclusive blog for Paddy Power. “It’s not a vintage Holland team he’s managing and Van Gaal has got them to the brink of a World Cup Final. He’s going to have to perform a similar operation at United after a shocking season in 2013-2014. “Van Gaal seems to have the Midas touch, and with his coaching reputation and vast experience he can bring a lot to the club. He’ll improve last year’s performance by 20 to 25 per cent, I feel. “As well as the new signings, Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera, (and hopefully more to come) he’ll bring more out of the players who are already there. I’m actually really excited about next season.” Scholes also believes that Van Gaal's key substitutions at crucial times during Netherlands' World Cup run shows that he has "a bit of genius about him". “Van Gaal is not afraid of big decisions, which he showed by bringing on the Newcastle keeper Tim Krul for the Dutch No1 Jasper Cillessen for the penalty shootout against Costa Rica,” he added. “Krul had only saved two out of last 20 penalties with Newcastle. The evidence did not seem to be there for that big a decision. But whatever Louis van Gaal does, seems to work. "He substituted his captain, Robin van Persie, when Holland were 1-0 down to Mexico, and they came back to win. He seems to hav, and hopefully can work this magic on United next year.”	sports

The versatile defender was utilised in midfield for his country's first four games in Brazil before being returned to his usual full-back berth for the 1-0 quarter-final win over France. Lahm looked more at home in defence but he refused to be drawn into the debate over where he should be deployed by coach Joachim Low, arguing that the only thing that matters is what is right for the group. “I know I haven't played my best football throughout the tournament, but it isn't about me or any other player," the Bayern Munich ace told the Times of India. "It’s about the team and about winning the matches." “For me and everyone else in the squad, it is important that the team is successful and that we develop ourselves further. This is what we are working towards. “I wasn’t surprised [by being moved to full-back for the France game]. The coach decides which player to put in which position. "He also decides what formation, which starting 11 and what substitutions he makes and we players follow that.” The Germany captain is happy with Germany's overall performance in Brazil but believes his side have to improve on their player in the final third if they are to go and win the title. “Though we haven't been perfect, we have done a lot of things right. Therefore we are in the semi-finals of the tournament,” he mused ahead of Tuesday's last-four meeting with Brazil in Belo Horizonte. “We have had a lot of good attacks in all our matches, but the final pass or the goals haven't come which would have made things a lot easier for us. “We came to Brazil with the aim of winning our fourth World Cup title.

The Liverpool forward was suspended for nine competitive international fixtures and banned from all football-related activity for four months after being found guilty of biting the defender during Uruguay's 1-0 win over the Azzurri in the group stages of World Cup 2014. Italian legislation allows trials into incidents that occurred outside the country if the victim is an Italian citizen and courts in Rome have confirmed that the case has been brought to their attention. “Now we are waiting to see what the courts decide,” Codacons President Carlo Rienzi told Sport Mediaset. “If they recognise, as we suggested, a potential crime in Suarez’s behaviour, then they can analyse the video and photographic evidence.” The case was put forward solely by the Codacons and neither Chiellini nor the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) have played a part in the legal action. The union has tried to file football-related law suits in the past, including one which called on Serie A to be halted following refereeing errors. It was claimed by the union that the mistakes resulted in people who had paid to watch the match or have a bet on the game being defrauded.	sports

Di Stefano, 88, had been under supervision at Madrid's Gregorio Maranon Hospital after suffering a heart attack on Saturday, but the two-time Ballon d'Or winner sadly passed away two days later. Tributes have been flowing in for the Argentine-born forward, who scored 308 goals in 396 appearances for Madrid, and now Ferguson has paid his respects to a legendary figure. "The great question which always comes up is 'who are the greatest players?'" the Scot told Sky Sports News. "There is a phalanx of great ones – [Johan] Cruyff, [Diego] Maradona, Pele, [Ferenc] Puskas and Di Stefano. Di Stefano was one of the greatest in my mind. "He had fantastic balance and poise – if you look at one of the goals he scored against Eintracht Frankfurt it was completely what we were talking about – the balance he had. Unbelievable, he was." Di Stefano - winner of five consecutive European cups with Real between 1956 and 1960 - went on to coach the iconic club in two separate spells. In his first stint, Di Stefano came up against Ferguson's Aberdeen in the 1983 European Cup Winners' Cup final, which was won by the Scottish club 2-1 after extra time in Sweden - a meeting the former United boss remembers clearly. "It was an honour to come up against Di Stefano," he said. "What I did, out of respect for him, was I bought a bottle of Scottish Malt whisky and gave it to him the night before the match when the two teams had an opportunity to train on the pitch at the venue for the final. "We were second, they were first. When he came off, they were coming down the tunnel and I said 'Mr Di Stefano, I'd like to give you this gift.' He was taken aback; he was really taken aback. Ferguson added: "He said, 'Aberdeen are a team that money can't buy. They have a soul, and a family spirit'. Those words – you couldn't say any more, in terms of praise for a football team. It was very generous of him. "He was always the focus of Real Madrid wherever they went. He had a fantastic life and I'm proud to have been associated with him in a small way."	sports

Meanwhile, Netherlands centre-back Stefan de Vrij insisted that he is not in the least bit perturbed by the prospect of dealing with Messi. "I'm not afraid of anyone," the defender told Algemeen Dagbald. "Not even Messi. "I am especially focused on him, but I’m not afraid of him. In fact, I am very happy to play against him.” Netherlands are bidding to reach their second successive World Cup final, having been beaten 1-0 by Spain in the tournament decider in South Africa four years ago.	sports
Goal Academy Watch: Football School Of India - Goal.com	Goal takes you through a tour of the upcoming Football School of India, situated in three cities of Maharashtra, that is sure to become a breeding ground for India's future stars Continuing its special series on the elite football academies in India, Goal today has a look at one of the neo-age establishments that is fast ensuring it becomes a future supply-line for India's next generation of stars - Football School of India Abhishek Yadav is the founder and coach-in-chief at the academy and has turned out for various clubs including Mumbai FC, Mahindra United and Churchill Brothers, winning all there is to won in India. He also has 33 international caps to his name for the Blue Tigers. Here, in an exclusive interview with Goal, he lays down the goals, aspirations and methods he plans to implement to achieve success with the academy. Football School of India (FSI) was born out of the intense desire of Yadav to ensure the children who are destined to become future footballers in country were equipped with the right amount of technical training at an early age so as to seamlessly develop themselves. “We’re not saying we can make all the players represent the country, but if we at least make three wear the national colours, it's mission accomplished for us," said Yadav. He believes that the advice available for the youngsters today wasn't something the previous generation of players availed of. He also aims to integrate football in the existing education for the holistic development of the youngsters. As stated above, the academy was Yadav's initiation, with help from former Indian internationals Shanmugham Venkatesh and Deepak Mandal. Yadav thanks his friends and co-founders who travel specially to Mumbai to impart not just information to the kids, but also to motivate the kids. FSI, which orignally began operation in Mumbai, has two other centres in Pune and Nashik. Motivation is a founding block for propagation of excellence in Abhishek's words and this is wired throughout the academy's functionings.   Abhhishek Yadav is the co-founder of the academy Having just initiated the academy over one-and-a-half years ago, Yadav is the head coach. He is assisted in his work by TEN other coaches spread throughout the centres of FSI. Of these coaches, one holds a 'B' license badge, whilst the others are actively pursuing their coaching certificates. Yadav states that the expenses of the coaches are all taken care of by the FSI management, so as to help them attain the required experience, with no burden on them. "I understand the troubles with the financial aspect of the license and don't want to burden them at all," says Yadav.  The academy is one of the few new saplings who actively employs a sports psychologist as well as a dedicated physiotherapist. Yadav elucidates that the focus is also on the self-help aspect for kids. The most important information here is that the academy actively tries to involve the parents in the training and feedback programs to ensure the child develops in an overall fashion. Unlike many government funded institutes or private ones, FSI carries out active scouting missions in centres where football activities are a major draw. Having coaches spread throughout the country and armed with a keen eye for spotting talent, the founder explains, "Quality in quantity is my mantra. Our coaches are trained in spotting talent in a crowd and we make sure we attempt to entice the kids we shortlist from tournaments held in not just metros, but other towns as well." The academy hopes to be a hotbed for Indian internationals in the future With no specific period of the year for recruitment shortlisted, the focus is on talent recruitment immediately. "If I find somebody better than anyone I've trained, I make the effort to entice him immediately," he explained. For an academy which operates within the age groups of Under-6 to Under-17, the institute is considerably well-equipped, especially keeping in mind its relative infancy. The academy has a field in Panvel, which has an astro-turf. A gymnasium has been added too, though Yadav expounds that he doesn't encourage much participation from young kids in weight-lifting, though body exercises are the order of the day. Their head coach though, thinks the ground serves the purpose of the academy, whilst highlighting the importance of the medicinal ball. He mentioned that they do a lot of training with the ball instead of mere physical drills so as to improve their touch on the ball. “We do a lot of our work on-the-ball training. But I ensure the kids train and enlightened on the advantages of using a medicinal ball everyday.” Unfortunately, being a new initiative, Yadav has barely had time to advertise his academy to sponsors. He explains that prepping up the academy itself has been so demanding, that he has barely had time to look elsewhere.  He hopes to change this in the future though, to avoid fates of other renowned academies that have faded away due to lack of investments. The kids in the three age categories are subject to one session daily, which, as stated by Yadav, takes place from 4.30 to 6.30 in the evening, to facilitate school timings for kids. On weekends, morning sessions are prime focus. All sessions are pre-planned, with a lot of focus on "on-the-ball excellence." "Learning Football is so much fun at Football School of India. We get to train with India international players. Just by playing with them we learn so much. I want to play for India some day,” says Nakul Shelke, a young colt training with the academy.  Rating – 7/10 As Yadav hypothesizes, India is a hotbed for talent. He believes it is his prerogative to help them blossom, especially in the world of Indian football. One hopes they achieve their goals so as to ensure a better, brighter future for Indian football.

Prandelli: Galatasaray will win with style - Goal.com	The former Italy boss is determined to lead the club into a new era of success after being named as Roberto Mancini's successor at the Turk Telekom Arena Galatasaray unveiled Cesare Prandelli as their new coach on Tuesday, with the Italian immediately setting his sights on creating a team that is both successful and stylish. The 56-year-old only stepped down as Italy boss just under two weeks ago, but has already embarked upon a new coaching adventure after being confirmed as compatriot Roberto Mancini's successor at the Turk Telekom Arena.  Last season, the Istanbul club finished second in the Super Lig and reached the last-16 of the Champions League, so Prandelli, who put pen to paper on a two-year contract, is determined to deliver silverware with an attractive brand of football. "Our mission is to create a winning team, able to win trophies and play an entertaining style of football," the former Fiorentina boss declared. "I’ve visited the technical centre, I think we have everything to work and perform well. "To achieve success, every supporter, every player, every part of the club has to think the same way. There are many good players already, we all have to work hard together." Encouragingly, Prandelli already appears to have struck up a good rapport with Unal Aysal, revealing that the Gala chairman played a key role in persuading him to make a swift return to the dug-out. "I immediately found great sympathy with chairman Unal Aysal. When we met the first time I was immediately convinced by a winning project," added Prandelli. "This club has a very rich and great history but, as Aysal said, we have to look at a great future ahead of us." Prandelli vacated his role as Italy boss after failing to lead the Azzurri out of the group stage of World Cup 2014. 	sports

Silvestre: Shaw’s signing is a good investment by Manchester United - Goal.com	The former Manchester United defender believes that Louis Van Gaal is the right man to take the club forward... EXCLUSIVE By Shikharr Chandra Mikael Silvestre backed Manchester United for having spent £30 million to snap up Luke Shaw from Southampton on a four-year deal. Shaw will earn around £160,000 a week at Old Trafford, making him the highest-paid teenager in world football. Silvestre opined that the deal wasn’t ‘expensive’ for United given that they have tied the player down for at least four years. “You have to look at the entire deal here. Okay the sum is £30 million but how long has he signed for? Four years. So you have to keep that in mind as well." “I know it’s expensive if you look at it this way but when you join Manchester United you don’t stay there for just one year, you will probably be there for four or five years. I stayed there for nine years. So overall, after six or seven years, you won’t say that it was an expensive deal. It is a good investment by the club,” he told Goal at an event celebrating Chevrolet’s debut on Manchester United’s home shirt which also saw General Motors India launch the Chevrolet Beat and SAIL Hatchback Manchester United Limited Editions. Manchester United had a tumultuous 2013-14 season where they finished seventh, missing out on a place in the Champions League. David Moyes, who was appointed successor to Sir Alex Ferguson was shown the door less than nine months into the job with Ryan Giggs taking over the reins for the final five matches. Silvestre feels that it’s unfair to lay all the blame on Moyes and everyone needs to ponder over what went wrong. “I wasn’t in the dressing room and so I can’t really comment on what happened inside. But the performances were below par. They were not consistent enough and when you challenge for the Premier League, Champions League and the FA Cup, you need consistency." “Sadly that was not the case. I can’t exactly say who was to be blamed. Everyone has responsibilities and I don’t think the players are blaming Moyes or Moyes is blaming the players. Everyone has to look at themselves and ask whether ‘I could have done better’ because from the outside it was a bit difficult to judge,” he reasoned. Louis Van Gaal has been appointed as the Manchester United manager and the Dutchman is expected to take over following Netherlands’s sojourn at the World Cup. The 36 year-old believes that Van Gaal will lead Manchester United to winning ways once again. “As soon as he was announced as the new manager, I was convinced that he will be a good one for United. He has a great record for both club and country and he is just showing that in the World Cup with Netherlands. He has got what it takes to be a manager for a club like United and he is coming at the right time.” Next season, Manchester United will be without two of their most experienced centre-backs in Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand with the former having joined Inter Milan while the latter is expected to pen a deal with Queens Park Rangers soon. The French defender hopes that the 20-time league champions are active in the transfer market so as to cover for the said positions. “I think there have already been two signings (Ander Herrera and Shaw) and we can expect more by the end of August, so we will see then. They lost two centre-backs this time and so we can expect the manager to sign a couple of experienced players in that area.”	sports
Liverpool star Jose Enrique thrilled at return to fitness - Goal.com	The Spainard's 2013-14 campaign was prematurely ended in November by a knee injury but he is back in pre-season training and desperate to get onto the pitch soon After a season plagued by injuries, Liverpool full-back Jose Enrique is desperate to hit the ground running in the 2014-15 campaign. The Spaniard made just eight Premier League appearances last term before a knee injury in November curtailed any further involvement. However, with the Reds' new season set to begin on August 16 at home to Southampton, Enrique is approaching full fitness and cannot wait to get started. "I've been here since last week and I'm really happy," he told the club's official website on his return to pre-season training. "I've been waiting for this moment for so long. I'm feeling great. "I'm really happy to try to be playing games again. I've been working in the summer and I've been here for the last week. I've been working quite a lot in fitness terms. "You can work on your own but, when you work with other people, it's different. "They told me little by little, I have to be careful, because I don't want a setback. "I've been working with the physios; I only stopped for a week but for the rest of the holidays, I have been working because I have to be completely fit for this season."	sports

Brazil 1 - 7 Germany Match report - Goal.com	The veteran striker broke Ronaldo's record for finals goals as Thomas Muller, Sami Khedira, Toni Kroos and Andre Schurrle combined to decimate Luiz Felipe Scolari's side Germany have reached the World Cup final after they annihiliated hosts  Brazil 7-1 in their semi-final clash in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday. Shorn of injured playmaker Neymar, who suffered a fractured vertebra in the quarter-final against Colombia, and suspended captain Thiago Silva, Brazil were torn apart by a ruthless Germany at Estadio Mineirao. Miroslav Klose became the leading scorer in World Cup finals history as Joachim Low's side scored four goals in the space of six first-half minutes and led 5-0 after only 29 minutes, then struck twice in the second half to set up a final against either Netherlands or Argentina at the Maracana on Sunday. Thomas Muller set the ball rolling with his fifth of the tournament and veteran striker Klose netted his 16th World Cup goal, surpassing legendary Brazil striker Ronaldo's tally as the shell-shocked Selecao were totally outclassed. Brazil had no answer to Germany's passing and movement as Toni Kroos struck twice and Sami Khedira added a fifth before substitute Andre Schurrle scored twice in the second half as the hosts were totally humiliated in the most emphatic semi-final win in World Cup history. Oscar pulled back a late goal on the break, but it was no consolation on a miserable night for Brazil. Germany were a class apart and Brazil fans sportingly applauded as they became the first team to score seven goals in a World Cup semi-final and will take some beating as they attempt to win the trophy for the first time since 1990, while the inquest will now start for the home nation. The hosts started brightly against Colombia in the quarter-finals, but looked nervous early on and Germany took full advantage when Muller put them in front just 11 minutes in courtesy of some dreadful defending. It was all too straightforward for the Bayern Munich forward, who side-footed home after being left unmarked from an outswinging Kroos corner. Brazil looked disjointed as they gave the ball away far too easily, while Germany were playing with a swagger and doubled their lead with a landmark Klose goal after 23 minutes. Muller was involved once again, as he cut in from the right and laid the ball off for Klose after being picked out by an incisive Kroos pass. The veteran striker slotted into the corner with his right foot after Julio Cesar had kept out his initial attempt. Luiz Felipe Scolari's men were stunned, but far worse was to come as Germany capitalised on more shambolic defending to score another three goals in the space of five minutes. First, Kroos was on hand to fire home with his left foot from 18 yards after Muller had failed to make contact with a Philipp Lahm pass, then the midfielder struck again almost straight from the kick-off as Brazil fell apart. The Bayern Munich man robbed Fernandinho as he dithered in possession and laid the ball off for Khedira, who unselfishly cut it back for his fellow midfielder to net. And the outstanding Khedira got in on the act by adding a fifth with only 29 minutes gone, driving forward and passing to Mesut Ozil and then finishing with his right foot after the Arsenal midfielder cut the ball back to him inside the penalty area.   Scolari replaced Fernandinho and Hulk with Paulinho and Ramires at half-time and both substitutes were in the thick of the action early in the second half as they brought saves out of Manuel Neuer. But normal service was resumed as Germany showed no mercy and Cesar produced a fine save to tip over Muller's goal-bound striker on the hour mark. Cesar could do nothing to deny substitute Schurrle a sixth goal 69 minutes in, though, and once again it was all too easy as Lahm fed Khedira, who in turn picked out the Chelsea forward and he made no mistake with a simple finish. And Schurrle put Germany in seventh heaven with a clinical left-foot finish at the near post 11 minutes from time that prompted Brazil fans to sportingly applaud despite their heartbreak. Oscar pulled a goal back when he cut inside Jerome Boateng and finished a minute from time, but the damage had long since been done.	sports

Darren Fletcher relishes 'feisty' pre-season with Manchester United - Goal.com	The Scottish midfielder, who has endured long spells on the sidelines with injury, is excited about the prospect of facing the likes of Roma, Inter and Real Madrid this summer Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher is excited at the prospect of a challenging pre-season tour of United States. The Red Devils are due to visit the States later in July, with a minimum of four games against strong opposition. Following a clash with LA Galaxy, they will take part in the International Champions Cup, in which they will come up against Roma, Inter and Real Madrid. Should they reach the final, Louis van Gaal's side will take on Manchester City, Liverpool, AC Milan or Olympiakos and Fletcher is looking forward to a tough build-up ahead of the 2014-15 season. "You want to challenge yourself against the best and, although it's pre-season, if you're playing against someone like Real Madrid you are going to be against top-quality opposition," the Scot told the club's official website. "It's like in training here: when we play in two teams it becomes quite competitive and you'll see the same in these tour matches. "Once you get on that pitch it's competitive and you always want to win every game and every tournament you're involved in. "I'm sure the sports science lads will be saying that it's all about minutes and not getting injured but sometimes these games can get feisty. "It's what you want as you want to make an impression and impress the fans and the manager because you want to be in the team for the start of the season."	sports

British executive arrested in probe into illegal ticket sales - Goal.com	A Match Hospitality director has been held as part of Operation Jules Rimet – a police investigation into ticket touting at this summer's tournament in Brazil Ray Whelan, the chief executive of a Fifa partner, was arrested by Brazilian police as part of an investigation into the illegal sale of tickets at World Cup 2014. The Briton, a director from Match Hospitality and the former agent of Sir Bobby Charlton, had been staying at the same Rio de Janeiro hotel as Fifa president Sepp Blatter and several other officials from football’s governing body when he was taken into custody. Whelan was later released after questioning. It has been alleged that certain officials have illegally resold tickets, including some that were allocated to players. Last week, 11 people were held over illegal ticket sales and those found guilty could face charges of money laundering, criminal association and illegally selling tickets. Whelan is not a Fifa employee but Match have worked closely with the governing body since 1986 and the company recently paid $240 million (£140m) to secure the exclusive contract to provide hospitality packages until 2023. Police believe that an international gang could have earned $90m (€66m) per tournament for ticket touting and could have operated at as many as four World Cups. Philippe Blatter, Sepp Blatter’s nephew, is the president of a company which is a shareholder in Match.  	sports

Netherlands v Argentina Match preview - Goal.com	Dutch midfielder and Manchester City striker have both recovered from injury to feature for their respective nations, as they battle it out to face Germany or Brazil in the final Wednesday’s second semi-final brings together two of the world’s most enthralling footballing nations in a repeat of the final from the last South American World Cup in Argentina in 1978. Netherlands have confounded many people’s expectations by reaching the last four with a squad of which very little was expected. Whereas their reliance on a large number of Eredivisie-based players was thought to be a weakness, the impact of many of the lesser names has been a real strength in their run to the semi-finals. Coach Louis van Gaal has needed such a boost from the supporting cast too, with pre-tournament injuries to Kevin Strootman and Stijn Schaars followed by the loss of Nigel De Jong in the early moments of the last-16 clash against Mexico. Having stunned many by bringing on Tim Krul to make the winning penalty saves against Costa Rica in the last round, Van Gaal is set to hand first-choice keeper Jasper Cillessen the gloves once more against Argentina in what is likely to be an unchanged starting XI. Van Gaal's opposite number Alejandro Sabella has no such luxury, with Angel Di Maria missing due to a thigh strain which is likely to rule him out of the rest of the tournament. While Sergio Aguero returns after a leg muscle injury, Sabella must choose whether to give Ezequiel Lavezzi a start or bring in one of Fernando Gago or Maxi Rodriguez in Di Maria’s place. Marcos Rojo’s return from suspension should see him start ahead of Jose Maria Basanta, while Federico Fernandez could again miss out in favour of Martin Demichelis. NETHERLANDS: Cillessen; Vlaar, De Vrij, Martins Indi; Kuyt, Wijnaldum, Sneijder, Blind; Robben, Van Persie, Depay. ARGENTINA: Romero; Zabaleta, Demichelis, Garay, Rojo; M. Rodriguez, Gago, Biglia; Messi, Aguero, Higuain.	sports

Mediawatch, Mailbox, Ref365, John Nicholson, Spanish Thing | Football365	We're only just catching our breath after the incredible scenes at the Estadio Mineirao. Germany were simply spectacular, while it could take Brazil years to recover... Louis van Gaal is a manager that often nudges into the bizarre, but changing his goalkeeper for penalties was ballsy even for him. Of course, it worked a treat... Argentina have been dismissed as a one-man team, but that does an ignorant disservice to the contributions of Javier Mascherano. He's been absolutely superb... After a pulsating, absorbing match Brazil have made it through to the semi-finals. It may not have been pretty, but there should be no marks awarded for aesthetics... Germany have been roundly criticised over the last week, but against France they were ominously recognisable. Die Maschine has clicked into knockout stage mode... We might be sentimentally liking Brazil or be blown away by Colombia, but England fans should cheer on our near neighbours to protect those World Cup places...	sports
Football365 | Mediawatch	Brazil are the dirtiest team at the World Cup (sort of), whilst Dirk Kuyt has been welcomed in from the cold. Liverpool didn't fancy Suarez anyway... FIFA need to act before football is sent back to the Dark Ages and Marc Wilmots has a good cry. Go on, Marc, let it all out... Why aren't England as good as France, Luis Suarez is more villainous than Lance Armstrong and Steven Howard imagines a blast... Luis Suarez explains why he really wouldn't be happy at Barcelona, Oscar struggles to impose himself, there's quite a coincidence in The Sun and more... Martin Samuel has found the real reason for England's failure, while Adam Lallana's dreams have changed in spectacular fashion. Plus Lawro wishes it was the 1970s... Sorry but we have to turn to Adrian Durham and Martin Samuel again...because they keep writing nonsense. Apparently Lineker should have cheated like, erm, Suarez...	sports
Football365 | Opinion | Mailbox	'Do Liverpool need to replace Suarez?' is the question raised by one mailboxer, whilst we also have thoughts on Markovic, McCormack, Fulham and 'doing a Spurs'... One chap in the mailbox suspects mischief at Anfield over Luis Suarez's proposed move to Barcelona. Plus, more on the Reds becoming the new Tottenham... Will selling Elvis and buying The Beatles work better for Liverpool than it did for Spurs? Plus, Lazar Markovic's record compares rather unfavourably to Bebe's... You can judge United's new manager's talent by the amount fans of other clubs are already denigrating him. Plus disappointing Hazard, half lengths and youth development... Restricting the number of foreign players will only exacerbate England's problems, according to one Mailboxer. We also have the tragedy of Wesley Brown and more on Scouse maths... We have a wonderful new approach to Anfield arithmetic in the Mailbox. There is also a heartfelt goodbye to Luis Suarez and "Juan Mata probably voted UKIP"...	sports
Football365 - Football News, Views, Gossip and much more...	Claudio Bravo is relishing the challenge of replacing Victor Valdes at Barcelona following his move from Real Sociedad. Arsenal are close to signing Barcelona star Alexis Sanchez and Newcastle's Mathieu Debuchy, according to Sky sources. Villarreal are poised to sign Serbian defender Antonio Rukavina on a two-year contract, pending the result of a medical. Keylor Navas' agent has claimed that both FC Porto and Atletico Madrid have made offers for the Costa Rica goalkeeper.

Mediawatch, Mailbox, Ref365, John Nicholson, Spanish Thing | Football365	It might all be sold to us as dancing girls and thronging, singing crowds, but Brazil's obsession with their national team has a dark edge. It's all just a sad diversion... Like everyone else, our Johnny has hugely enjoyed this superb tournament. He believes that's down to a collective blending of physicality, skill and direct football... Jack Wilshere never got better, Theo Walcott hasn't improved, so why are we assuming that Ross Barkley, Luke Shaw, Daniel Sturridge etc will be better in two years? This World Cup has demonstrated the potential for a team to be greater than the sum of its parts. Now England must learn that vital lesson, says John Nicholson... ...so trying to find somebody or something to blame or change is pointless. We've failed with young, old, expectation, no expectation, English, foreign and everything else... Now it's a no-brainer. Perhaps John Nicholson is being a tad naive, but he doesn't believe there would even be an outcry if Hodgson dropped Wayne Rooney...	sports
The Fazenda Gossip | Football Transfer Rumours and Gossip | Football365	United in talks with Vidal, City to replace Toure with Pogba and Medel off to Inter... Last Updated: 08/07/14 at 14:26 Post Comment Latest Articles Delay in Suarez deal, Arsenal closing on Sanchez and Debuchy, Richards to Newcastle, United in for Hummels and... Chelsea given Pogba hope, City close to sealing goalkeeper deal and Napoli after loan deal for Lucas... UNITED OPEN VIDAL TALKS Whilst Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw may well prove to be good signings both, the arrival of Arturo Vidal at Old Trafford would be the statement of intent to announce that Manchester United are back, baby. The Gazzetta dello Sport believe that United officials have already begun discussions with Vidal's agent in order to discuss personal terms ahead of the club agreeing a fee with Juventus. There seems to be an awful lot of this about now, so apparently 'tapping up' isn't a thing anymore. Which is nice. Clearly there is a heck of a long way left until a deal can be considered close, but it does appear that United are finally serious in their attempts to rebuild a particularly downtrodden central midfield. CITY TO CHASE POGBA IF TOURE LEAVES Well hello there L'Equipe, and a good afternoon to you. Someone's going a little ballsy with their transfer gossip aren't they? The French paper claim that with Yaya Toure wanting out of Manchester City due to significant cake-related c**k-ups, City may look to Paul Pogba as a replacement for the Ivorian. Clearly it's a slightly fanciful story, with suggestions that Toure will join Paris St Germain in this window, leaving City enough time to tempt Pogba back to Manchester, paying a £60million fee in the process. Maybe FFP doesn't exist either. Still, another punishment from UEFA would surely be made worthwhile be the look on the faces of United fans if City has their free transfer running the midfield? MEDEL OFF TO INTER From the sunny climes of Italy and France to the wonderful scenery of South Wales, now, and news that Gary Medel's sojourn at Cardiff looks to be over after less than a year. It always seemed unlikely that Medel would be content to go from Brazil to Championship pre-season training without passing Go and, after reported interest from Inter, it appears that the Italian club will make a formal offer for the Chilean's services. WalesOnline today claim that a deal will be agreed for Medel to move to Milan on an initial loan basis, with an option to buy in 12 months' time. Having been bought for £11million, we can't quite work out why Cardiff wouldn't be looking to get a fee for the player right now.	sports
Winners & Losers | Football365	Barcelona have been forced to take a more mature approach to rebuilding this summer, with a strong focus on fixing the defence. It's a big job for Luis Enrique... No question about who tops the winners while Liverpool are included despite, frankly, cocking it up. Arsenal are in the losers list as they face another summer of 'what if'... Jose Mourinho's air of self-preservation is starting to become incredibly tedious, says Matthew Stanger. Manchester City top the Winners after a strangely surreal win... Man City now have it all to lose after Jose Mourinho did Manuel Pellegrini a huge favour. It's a rare occasion when Liverpool are in the losers and Man United in the winners... Only Liverpool can top Matt Stanger's Winners despite evident defensive shortcomings, whilst Manchester United's players looked bored in a huge game for their manager That's right, Liverpool are on top after their vital victory over Man City, who haven't underachieved as much as some would argue. Plus, Chelsea and the aesthetics of winning...	sports
Football365 | Faves | Topical Top 10	It's the time of year when managers look through their squad lists before frowning and putting a question mark next to one name. Daniel Storey picks ten that need to move on... With the news that Manchester United missed out on signing James Rodriguez for £5million in 2010, here is Daniel Storey's list of the top ten ones that got away. The World Cup has been sodding brilliant so far, but grumpy Daniel Storey has still managed to pick out ten disappointments. Ronaldo, Spain and some woeful punditry... After Robin van Persie's sexy goal against Spain, Daniel Storey picks ten of his favourite diving headers from down the years. There's some filth in here... As giddiness builds ahead of the WC kick off on Thursday, Ian Watson outlines the ten players he is most interested to see perform in Brazil. There's obvious and not so obvious... We've tried to be a little inventive with our picks (so no Neymar, Messi and Ronaldo), but there are plenty of reasons to back the ten names on this list for the Golden Boot...	sports
Football365 | Faves | Cheeky Punt	Degsy has put the mortgage on an early flight home for England and is tipping Argentina and Sergio Aguero to fill their boots in Brazil... Degsy got a whole load of stick last week for backing Sunderland to win at Man United so he's happy to put his head up again and back Newcastle at Liverpool... Degsy thinks Sunderland can pull off another big result at Old Trafford on Saturday, while he's also backing Yaya Toure to carry Man City to victory against Everton... Degsy is tipping Liverpool at -1 to beat Chelsea on Sunday, while Danny Welbeck is backed to begin to post-Moyes Man United era with goals against Norwich... Everton slipped up against Crystal Palace in midweek, but Degsy's tipping them to beat United on Sunday. Plus, there will be no problems for Liverpool and Chelsea... Liverpool and Man City have 174 goals between them so far and Degsy is tipping more of the same when the two sides meet at Anfield on Sunday...	sports
Mineirazo: A Night That Will Never Be Forgotten | Mediawatch, Mailbox, Ref365, John Nicholson, Spanish Thing | Football365	We're only just catching our breath after the incredible scenes at the Estadio Mineirao. Germany were simply spectacular, while it could take Brazil years to recover... Last Updated: 09/07/14 at 00:25 Post Comment Latest Articles 'Do Liverpool need to replace Suarez?' is the question raised by one mailboxer, whilst we also have thoughts on Markovic, McCormack, Fulham and 'doing a Spurs'... One chap in the mailbox suspects mischief at Anfield over Luis Suarez's proposed move to Barcelona. Plus, more on the Reds becoming the new Tottenham... The anguish on every Brazilian face in the Estadio Mineirao said it all. Some with tear-stained face paint, others in sheer disbelief. Eleven drenched in cold sweat. This was history in the making; the 2014 Mineirazo to rival 1950's Maracanazo. At least on that occasion Brazil were afforded the chance to play in Rio. With each passing moment a nation unravelled. After 26 minutes it was the first time Brazil had conceded four goals in a World Cup match since a 4-2 defeat to Hungary in 1954; after 29 minutes it was the first time they had let in five at the finals since a 6-5 win over Poland in 1934; 69 minutes signalled the first time Brazil had conceded six at the World Cup; the final nail brought their record defeat, surpassing a 6-0 loss to Uruguay in 1920. Oscar reduced the deficit at the death but Brazil had long since succumbed. Consolation it was not. The damage was done in six incredible first-half minutes. If you blinked, you missed it. Thomas Muller had opened the scoring with his tenth World Cup strike after Germany cleverly blocked David Luiz in the box to allow the forward space for a simple finish, but suddenly Joachim Loew's side found another gear. It was sparked by Miroslav Klose becoming the first player to score 16 goals at the World Cup in front of the watching Ronaldo. On any other night that would have been headline news, but it barely registered amid the chaos. Toni Kroos followed Klose's lead with two in two minutes as Brazil were left chasing shadows. Sami Khedira scored the fifth. 'Brace yourself, the sixth is coming,' reads the slogan scribbled across the side of Brazil's team bus. This was not what the marketing department had in mind. At half time the home fans began to pour through the exit gates and out on to the streets. Those who remained were treated to a stunning brace from Andre Schurrle before showering Germany in "olés" for every touch. The ultimate embarrassment for their humiliated heroes. Brazil's reputation for jogo bonito had already been tarnished by several uninspiring displays over the past month, particularly the quarter-final clash with Colombia that Loew described as "brutal". Perhaps a new definition is required after the scenes we witnessed on Tuesday. With the star of the show, Neymar, absent through injury, the locals would have accepted a win by hook or by crook, but their dreams were ruthlessly extinguished by a blistering Germany performance. The tired cliche of ruthless German efficiency should not define this momentous occasion. The visitors played with a flair and fluency once exclusively reserved by their opponents. They eviscerated Brazil. They ripped away any lingering sense of the Seleção's footballing identity with each wonderful flowing attack and then wore it as a badge of honour amid a sea of yellow. Fearless doesn't do it justice, relentless only tells half the story. Luiz Felipe Scolari's legacy lies in tatters. His World Cup win in 2002 almost appears insignificant in the aftermath and he will now always be remembered for this ruination. Scolari made mistakes, he allowed the reaction to Neymar's injury to spiral out of control. The image of the manager arriving at the stadium in his '#ForcaNeymar' cap conjured up memories of Kenny Dalglish being interviewed in a Luis Suarez T-shirt during his second spell in charge of Liverpool. It was a siege mentality that backfired spectacularly. "This would have happened even with Neymar," said a shell-shocked Scolari in his post-match interview. Big Phil has never looked so little. Perhaps he was merely protecting a group of players who will be scarred for the rest of their lives, or perhaps he had finally realised the error of his ways. It matters little in the context of Brazil's catastrophic failure. It will take a generation to recover from this night and it will never, ever be forgotten.

Mineirazo: A Night That Will Never Be Forgotten | Mediawatch, Mailbox, Ref365, John Nicholson, Spanish Thing | Football365	We're only just catching our breath after the incredible scenes at the Estadio Mineirao. Germany were simply spectacular, while it could take Brazil years to recover... Last Updated: 09/07/14 at 00:25 Post Comment Latest Articles 'Do Liverpool need to replace Suarez?' is the question raised by one mailboxer, whilst we also have thoughts on Markovic, McCormack, Fulham and 'doing a Spurs'... One chap in the mailbox suspects mischief at Anfield over Luis Suarez's proposed move to Barcelona. Plus, more on the Reds becoming the new Tottenham... The anguish on every Brazilian face in the Estadio Mineirao said it all. Some with tear-stained face paint, others in sheer disbelief. Eleven drenched in cold sweat. This was history in the making; the 2014 Mineirazo to rival 1950's Maracanazo. At least on that occasion Brazil were afforded the chance to play in Rio. With each passing moment a nation unravelled. After 26 minutes it was the first time Brazil had conceded four goals in a World Cup match since a 4-2 defeat to Hungary in 1954; after 29 minutes it was the first time they had let in five at the finals since a 6-5 win over Poland in 1934; 69 minutes signalled the first time Brazil had conceded six at the World Cup; the final nail brought their record defeat, surpassing a 6-0 loss to Uruguay in 1920. Oscar reduced the deficit at the death but Brazil had long since succumbed. Consolation it was not. The damage was done in six incredible first-half minutes. If you blinked, you missed it. Thomas Muller had opened the scoring with his tenth World Cup strike after Germany cleverly blocked David Luiz in the box to allow the forward space for a simple finish, but suddenly Joachim Loew's side found another gear. It was sparked by Miroslav Klose becoming the first player to score 16 goals at the World Cup in front of the watching Ronaldo. On any other night that would have been headline news, but it barely registered amid the chaos. Toni Kroos followed Klose's lead with two in two minutes as Brazil were left chasing shadows. Sami Khedira scored the fifth. 'Brace yourself, the sixth is coming,' reads the slogan scribbled across the side of Brazil's team bus. This was not what the marketing department had in mind. At half time the home fans began to pour through the exit gates and out on to the streets.

What's Wrong With Sturridge On His Own Up Front? | Mediawatch, Mailbox, Ref365, John Nicholson, Spanish Thing | Football365	Latest Articles We're only just catching our breath after the incredible scenes at the Estadio Mineirao. Germany were simply spectacular, while it could take Brazil years to recover... One chap in the mailbox suspects mischief at Anfield over Luis Suarez's proposed move to Barcelona. Plus, more on the Reds becoming the new Tottenham... If you have anything to say on any subject, mail us at theeditor@fooball365.com Wanting Liverpool To 'Do A Spurs' I'm finding interesting that people presuming Liverpool will 'do a Tottenham' next year after signing a few decent players to replace one world class player. As if Tottenham went from challengers to relegation fodder. Last season, Tottenham finished with 3 fewer points and one place lower than they did the year before. If Liverpool can finish with 81 points and finish 3rd next year, I'll be quite happy to be honest. Gary Orford, LFC ...In response to the various emails discussing "Liverpool doing a Spurs". Personally I wouldn't be too upset if, having sold their best and most creative player, Liverpool, like Spurs, finished 1 place lower in the following season. I'd take third now if offered. Rob Smith ...The way everybody is predicting that Liverpool will 'do a Spurs' I had to double-check that the Londoners didn't get relegated last season. And what did I find? They dropped 3 points and a single spot on the table to sixth from the previous season. Not the improvement they hoped for, but not the disaster it's remembered as. If that's the sum total of the devastation wrought on Liverpool after Suarez goes I'd be content enough. Damien, Belfast (still need some new fullbacks though) Liverpool Can Play One Up Front Recently in the mailbox and in other places, I've seen lots of people saying that Liverpool need to buy a proper world class forward to replace Suarez. This may seem insane on my part but do they really need to? Yes, by losing Suarez Liverpool are losing about 45 goals + assists a season but I would argue that this now presents them with a very good opportunity to solidify their team by changing system. In a way, it was both a blessing and a curse that Brendan Rodgers had both Sturridge and Suarez, as having 2 brilliant strikers necessitated him playing 2 up front, which worked to an extent but was a massive contributing factor in Liverpool's inability to defend. Rather than looking to directly replace Suarez, Liverpool would probably be better off playing with just Sturridge up front and putting an extra midfielder in the team, rather than looking to splash out on Falcao etc. Whilst obviously I can't read Brendan Rodgers' mind, it seems that his moves in the transfer market would indicate he's considering something similar. Before Barcelona moved for Suarez, I was wondering where Lallana was going to play but now it's not hard to imagine a fluid 3 of him, Sterling and Coutinho/Markovic operating behind Sturridge with Gerrard and Henderson holding. While it's going to take some time to adjust to the loss of Suarez, in the long run Liverpool could end up marginally better off. They shouldn't concede as many goals playing like that (it would be gruesome if they were to try and play 2 up top in the latter stages of the Champions League) and it's not beyond the realms of possibility that Sturridge could step up and hit 30+ goals if he were to be the main striker. This is all conjecture at the moment though so I wouldn't be surprised to see Liverpool splash out £50m on Cavani! Brett (the more pertinent question is why aren't they buying any defenders), AFC He Got Three, But Point Still Sort Of Stands It is correct that Bebé is a striker and Markovic is a winger. You would think then that by playing as a winger/attacking midfielder in that Benfica (won the league by 7 points) team surrounded by far "higher calibre" players that the ones on offer at Paços de Ferreira (avoided relegation by 3 points) he would be chipping in with a fair few assists? Lazar Markovic assists 2013/14- 0. Zilch. Nada You also mention that Markovic is only 20 and Bebé is 23. Whilst that is undisputable, I think it should be taken into consideration that in terms of footballing development, while Markovic has been brought through academies since the age of 12, Bebé (through his well documented upbringing and lack of a proper home) only started playing with a proper club at the age of 19 and, due to a combination of injury and being Bebé, last season was his first proper crack at the whip in terms of being a starter in a proper league. As much as it may appear this is not a slight on Liverpool FC or its fans famous grasp of transfer related maths, it isn't. It's rather a slight on the state of the transfer market where £25m for a player of Markovic's quality becoming the norm. To put it another way- it seems bizarre that Markovic will be costing nearly 4x the amount of Origi, despite having had near identical seasons (30 appearances, 5 goals, 0 assists) in a similarly competitive league. Scott, Manchester Save Holtby Out of interest, how is Daniel Storey party to how highly Pochettino rates the Spurs players? And why would Holtby, a central midfielder, worry about the presence of wingers (Chadli and Townsend) in the squad? A quite bizarre inclusion, it has to be said. Holtby is highly rated by everyone I've spoken to at Spurs (fan-wise), probably has more energy than the rest of our midfield put together (definitely more enthusiasm), and seems like a keen learner. All in all, I'd expect him to fit the Pochettino mould far more than Sigurdsson, Paulinho, and possibly even Dembele for example. I doubt you could find me many Spurs fans who wouldn't be upset if Fritz was sold, when we could have a Van der Vaart mk II on our hands. Silly Mr Storey. Alex G, THFC (seems like a lovely chap too) (MC - It was more based on the fact he has been loaned out to a relagated side where he didn't impress, and at 23 needs to be playing regularly. No slight on the man, who does indeed seem a lovely chap) McCormack Madness I can't decide whether to Ross McCormack's transfer to Leeds is hilarious or depressing. Fresh from last season's ridiculousness where Harry "bare bones" Redknapp seemed to spend most of August acquiring more and more highly priced players, despite the club having already recklessly splurged cash in the Premier League the previous season, Fulham seem determined to demonstrate to the entire world just how ridiculous the Championship has now become. For as they lay out £11m for a 27 year old striker with a modestly good Championship goal record, the rest of the clubs in that division have to learn to adhere to "Financial Fair Play" regulations, sensibly restricting their spending relative to their operating budgets. Quite what is supposed to be "fair" about the three relegated clubs receiving more money in parachute payments than the rest of the division receives as their total share of the TV money, is beyond me. Jack Saunders (Ipswich Town for 7th!) Suarez WILL Miss Liverpool Chris Bascombe's article about how Suarez will miss Liverpool is ridiculous, and Mediawatch was right to lampoon it - but I think he's right. Suarez will miss Liverpool, just like Torres has admitted recently. Barcelona fans are outraged at the new President's decisions. There are many things that Bartomeu has done since being appointed that have annoyed Barca fans, and signing Suarez for a record fee when they would seemingly rather sign Falcao or Aguero is the biggest one. Local fans apparently would rather keep a La Masia-based team than buying the likes of Suarez, and after big names like Sanchez and Ibrahimovic have failed in previous years, its hard to blame them. That is before you even consider moral issues with Suarez's biting and the Evra incident. I wish Suarez would realize how good he has it at Liverpool and stay, but I've come to terms with the fact that it makes sense to let him leave, especially for 75m GBP. I'll miss him, I've never watched anyone remotely as good at football as him play in real life (seen Messi in 2 games live but unfortunately he didn't do much). But Suarez will miss Anfield too, even if he does well at Barcelona. Oliver (He won't miss the English press, though.) Dziggel, Geneva Switzerland Okay...

Football365 | Faves | Big Weekend	It's a race not a beauty contest, but City may well finish first whilst still looking pretty sexy. Plus some things to ponder for Roy the Boy and use of the word 'effectively'... City can go top for the first time since January 29, whilst Paul Lambert, Alan Pardew and Sam Allardyce might all need wins to save their jobs. It's Daniel Storey's Big Weekend... Ryan Giggs may not be the next United manager, but he gets the chance to prove that he should be the one after that. Plus, the next hurdle in Liverpool's sprint for the line. The Premier League title race is shaping up to climax in quite remarkable style. That is, unless Chelsea and Manchester City stuff things up this weekend. Please don't... Liverpool's most important league match in 25 years and a season-defining game for Arsenal. Chuck in a relegation battle and it's a bloody Big Weekend...

The Page That Is Ready To Meat His Maker | Football365 | Mediawatch	Latest Articles FIFA need to act before football is sent back to the Dark Ages and Marc Wilmots has a good cry. Go on, Marc, let it all out... Why aren't England as good as France, Luis Suarez is more villainous than Lance Armstrong and Steven Howard imagines a blast... Didn't Fancy You Anyway... Let's begin with some glorious revisionism from the Daily Telegraph's man in Liverpool, Chris Bascombe, regarding Luis Suarez's impending departure from Anfield. The headline states that 'Suarez will miss Liverpool as much as they will miss him', but you'll forgive Mediawatch for reserving judgment on that until the striker's 31 league goals have been matched by Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana et al. 'With embittered predictability, there will be an argument Liverpool are better off without Luis Suarez,' Bascombe begins, which is rather odd considering he's about to do exactly that... 'Suarez won't find a team built around him at Barcelona,' he continues. 'Nor will he encounter a home crowd or manager tolerant of those movements where the nutmegs don't come off, he concedes possession frequently and the audacious 25 yard chip goes 30 yards over.' That's right, screw the 31 goals, Liverpool sure won't miss those failed nutmegs and over-hit chips. They'll be glad to get rid, if anything. 'If he goes 18 months without noises being made about how he wishes he can come back, he'll have succeeded where Ian Rush, Michael Owen, Robbie Fowler and Torres failed. In all cases, no sooner had they gone they were pining for a return. The Kop goal makes (most) strikers seem a yard quicker and sharper.' To be clear, there is very little evidence to suggest The Kop can make a player quicker. Indeed, in the cases of Robbie Keane, Andy Carroll, El Hadji Diouf and Sean 'quicker than Michael Owen' Dundee, it seemed to make them a lot sodding slower. Baby If You've Got To Go Away "If he gets an offer from a big team maybe, but the teams who've asked for McCormack are from the Championship. Why should I sell McCormack? We are not desperate to sell him so why should we? If I needed the money, I would tell you frankly - I need the money, I have to sell, I'm not ashamed. McCormack is a matter of principle, not money. He's a beautiful player and he's staying at Leeds" - Leeds owner Massimo Cellino, June 21. 'We would like to reiterate our desire to keep Ross McCormack at Leeds United. This desire includes keeping all of our best players as we look to build a stronger and successful squad for the 2014/15 Championship season. Leeds United may not be the richest club in the Championship, but we do not need to sell our best players in order to run the club successfully' - Leeds United official statement, July 3. 'We are delighted to announce the signing of Ross McCormack from Leeds United for an undisclosed fee' - Fulham official statement, July 8. Presumably when claiming they wouldn't sell, Leeds and Cellino forgot to include the words "...unless we get a bats**t mental offer" as an afterthought. Fight For The Right 'Fight Night' screams out the headline on the back of The Sun, with Steven Howard whipping himself up into a frenzy ahead of tonight's World Cup semi-final between Brazil and Germany. 'Germany are steeling themselves for a roughing up from Brazil tonight,' Howard begins. 'Brazil are officially the DIRTIEST country at the World Cup with most fouls and yellow cards. The beautiful game is being buried under an avalanche of Brazilian fouls.' That's an interesting statistical claim from Howard. But of course, it ignores the fact that Costa Rica have received as many yellow cards as Brazil, and also picked up a red card, which surely makes them 'dirtier'? It also ignores the pertinent detail that Brazil have played more matches than 24 of the 32 teams in the World Cup, thus skewing the figures more than slightly. Mediawatch would advise Howard to watch back Honduras' group games before reflecting on such a claim. Out For The Kuyt Ian Ladyman writes a glowing tribute to the longevity of Dirk Kuyt in the Daily Mail, but Mediawatch can't help but feel that he is pushing the returning hero angle a little too far. 'Some athletes just refuse to heed the warning signs,' Ladyman begins. 'To take notice of the directions on the road. Some athletes just take what they can and keep moving forwards.' 'Kuyt nevertheless spent so long on 98 caps that even he may have wondered if his juice had finally run out. Prior to this World Cup, the 33-year-old had not played for his country since last year.' No, but that does rather give the impression that Kuyt was left out in the cold somewhat, which is untrue. In fact, Kuyt has been named in the matchday squad in every one of Netherlands' matches this year, and also played a part in each of the last four qualifiers for the World Cup. In fact, Kuyt hasn't been left out of a Dutch squad for over three years, but that doesn't really fit the returning hero narrative. Ballsy 'Exclusive' Of The Day 'Manchester United have stepped up their pursuit of £20million German star Mats Hummels' - The Daily Star. A very quick Google search reveals that the Daily Mirror, the Metro and the Daily Express all published the same story over the course of the last week. Standard. Quote Of The Day 'Cole shot a work experience kid at the training-ground. Who can defend that? He was an idiot. But he isn't a gangster' - Adrian Durham criticises those who criticise Ashley Cole in the Daily Mail. Mediawatch has heard Cole called many, many things. But never a 'gangster', which rather undermines having a popping at those who do. Headline Of The Day 'Juve Put Turin brakes On Sanchez To Arsenal' - Someone at the Metro like their decade-old music references. Worst Headline Of The Day 'Roovealed' - Because Wayne Rooney is wearing Manchester United's new kit. We grow ever wearier with The Sun Football Story Of The Day 'Russia's first-round exit from the World Cup might have sparked angry condom throwing and furious debates in Parliament but one Orthodox priest is rejoicing over the end of the "homosexual abomination". 'Alexander Shumsky took exception to the brightly coloured football shoes worn by players competing in Brazil, the Moscow Times reported. 'In a column for Russian People's Line, a Christian website, he claimed that players wearing green, yellow, pink or blue shoes were promoting the "gay rainbow". '"Wearing pink or blue shoes, [the squad] might as well wear women's knickers or a bra," Shumsky wrote, adding that he was also offended by the "unthinkable" hairstyles of some of players. '"Therefore I am glad that the Russian players have failed and, by the grace of God, no longer participate in this homosexual abomination"' - Independent.

Transfer news: Arsenal close to signing Barcelona’s Alexis Sanchez and Newcastle's Mathieu Debuchy | Football365 | Premier League News	Arsenal could spend around £40million this week on the capture of Barcelona’s Alexis Sanchez and Newcastle’s Mathieu Debuchy, according to Sky sources. Last Updated: 08/07/14 at 20:52 Post Comment Alexis Sanchez: Arsenal confident of signing striker Sky Sports News understands Arsenal are very confident of signing Chile international striker Sanchez for around £30million. Sanchez had been linked with a move to Liverpool and Juventus but Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger looks set to add the highly-rated Barca man to his striking options. Full-back Debuchy, meanwhile, is set to join the club for around £10m in the next 48 hours as Wenger fills the void left by the departure of Bacary Sagna to Manchester City. Debuchy was preferred to Sagna by France boss Didier Deschamps throughout the World Cup. Debuchy, 28, has played 46 appearances for Newcastle, scoring once, since moving to the club from Lille for £5.5m in January 2013. Barcelona have believed to have bowed to Sanchez's wish to leave and move to London rather than Liverpool, where he could have been used as a makeweight in a potential deal for Luis Suarez. The signing of Sanchez would present another major move by Arsenal, who smashed their transfer record at the end of last year's summer window to bring in Mesut Ozil from Real Madrid. A defensive midfielder is also said to be on Wenger's wanted list, with Lars Bender at Bayer Leverkusen reportedly a long-term target. Arsenal also released several players at the end of their contracts, including striker Nicklas Bendtner. The Denmark forward has several options, reported to be both from within the Premier League as well as European sides. Arsenal step up their pre-season schedule in New York at the end of the month ahead of hosting the Emirates Cup and the FA Community Shield against Manchester City at Wembley on August 10.	sports

Germany were simply spectacular, while it could take Brazil years to recover... Last Updated: 09/07/14 at 00:25 Post Comment Latest Articles 'Do Liverpool need to replace Suarez?' is the question raised by one mailboxer, whilst we also have thoughts on Markovic, McCormack, Fulham and 'doing a Spurs'... One chap in the mailbox suspects mischief at Anfield over Luis Suarez's proposed move to Barcelona. Plus, more on the Reds becoming the new Tottenham... The anguish on every Brazilian face in the Estadio Mineirao said it all. Some with tear-stained face paint, others in sheer disbelief. Eleven drenched in cold sweat. This was history in the making; the 2014 Mineirazo to rival 1950's Maracanazo. At least on that occasion Brazil were afforded the chance to play in Rio. With each passing moment a nation unravelled. After 26 minutes it was the first time Brazil had conceded four goals in a World Cup match since a 4-2 defeat to Hungary in 1954; after 29 minutes it was the first time they had let in five at the finals since a 6-5 win over Poland in 1934; 69 minutes signalled the first time Brazil had conceded six at the World Cup; the final nail brought their record defeat, surpassing a 6-0 loss to Uruguay in 1920. Oscar reduced the deficit at the death but Brazil had long since succumbed. Consolation it was not. The damage was done in six incredible first-half minutes. If you blinked, you missed it. Thomas Muller had opened the scoring with his tenth World Cup strike after Germany cleverly blocked David Luiz in the box to allow the forward space for a simple finish, but suddenly Joachim Loew's side found another gear. It was sparked by Miroslav Klose becoming the first player to score 16 goals at the World Cup in front of the watching Ronaldo. On any other night that would have been headline news, but it barely registered amid the chaos. Toni Kroos followed Klose's lead with two in two minutes as Brazil were left chasing shadows. Sami Khedira scored the fifth. 'Brace yourself, the sixth is coming,' reads the slogan scribbled across the side of Brazil's team bus. This was not what the marketing department had in mind. At half time the home fans began to pour through the exit gates and out on to the streets. Those who remained were treated to a stunning brace from Andre Schurrle before showering Germany in "olés" for every touch. The ultimate embarrassment for their humiliated heroes. Brazil's reputation for jogo bonito had already been tarnished by several uninspiring displays over the past month, particularly the quarter-final clash with Colombia that Loew described as "brutal". Perhaps a new definition is required after the scenes we witnessed on Tuesday. With the star of the show, Neymar, absent through injury, the locals would have accepted a win by hook or by crook, but their dreams were ruthlessly extinguished by a blistering Germany performance. The tired cliche of ruthless German efficiency should not define this momentous occasion. The visitors played with a flair and fluency once exclusively reserved by their opponents. They eviscerated Brazil. They ripped away any lingering sense of the Seleção's footballing identity with each wonderful flowing attack and then wore it as a badge of honour amid a sea of yellow. Fearless doesn't do it justice, relentless only tells half the story. Luiz Felipe Scolari's legacy lies in tatters. His World Cup win in 2002 almost appears insignificant in the aftermath and he will now always be remembered for this ruination. Scolari made mistakes, he allowed the reaction to Neymar's injury to spiral out of control. The image of the manager arriving at the stadium in his '#ForcaNeymar' cap conjured up memories of Kenny Dalglish being interviewed in a Luis Suarez T-shirt during his second spell in charge of Liverpool. It was a siege mentality that backfired spectacularly. "This would have happened even with Neymar," said a shell-shocked Scolari in his post-match interview. Big Phil has never looked so little. Perhaps he was merely protecting a group of players who will be scarred for the rest of their lives, or perhaps he had finally realised the error of his ways. It matters little in the context of Brazil's catastrophic failure. It will take a generation to recover from this night and it will never, ever be forgotten.

The anguish on every Brazilian face in the Estadio Mineirao said it all. Some with tear-stained face paint, others in sheer disbelief. Eleven drenched in cold sweat. This was history in the making; the 2014 Mineirazo to rival 1950's Maracanazo. At least on that occasion Brazil were afforded the chance to play in Rio. With each passing moment a nation unravelled. After 26 minutes it was the first time Brazil had conceded four goals in a World Cup match since a 4-2 defeat to Hungary in 1954; after 29 minutes it was the first time they had let in five at the finals since a 6-5 win over Poland in 1934; 69 minutes signalled the first time Brazil had conceded six at the World Cup; the final nail brought their record defeat, surpassing a 6-0 loss to Uruguay in 1920. Oscar reduced the deficit at the death but Brazil had long since succumbed. Consolation it was not. The damage was done in six incredible first-half minutes. If you blinked, you missed it.

Transfer news: West Ham make £9.5m offer for Ukraine international Yevhen Konoplyanka | Football365 | Premier League News	West Ham have tabled a £9.5million bid for Dnipro winger Yevhen Konoplyanka, Sky sources understand. Last Updated: 08/07/14 at 18:38 Post Comment Yevhen Konoplyanka: Has attracted interest from Premier League clubs The 24-year-old Ukraine international has attracted interest from a number of Premier League clubs, but the Hammers are hoping to win the race for his signature. However, Konoplyanka is thought to have a £12m buy-out clause in his contract and the east London club may need to meet that clause in order to progress with the transfer. Liverpool made a bid for Konoplyanka in the January transfer window but failed to agree a deal before the deadline, while Tottenham and Manchester United have previously been linked with the player. West Ham owners David Sullivan and David Gold have been active in the transfer market this summer after setting manager Sam Allardyce a target of a top-10 finish in the the Premier League. Forward Mauro Zarate, midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate and defender Aaron Cresswell have already arrived at Upton Park, but the signing of Konoplyanka would be a real coup for the club. Konoplyanka has made over 100 appearances for Dnipro since his debut in 2007, scoring 28 goals, and he has 36 caps and eight goals for Ukraine.	sports

Premier League: Sportswear giants Nike to end Manchester United sponsorship | Football365 | Premier League News	Sportswear giants Nike have decided not to renew their kit deal for Manchester United after next season. Last Updated: 08/07/14 at 22:57 Post Comment New Manchester United kit was revealed on Monday The American company have supplied the Old Trafford club since 2002 when they replaced Umbro in a lucrative deal which has cost Nike around £24million a season. Although some reports at the weekend suggested a new record-breaking deal was set to be concluded, Nike revealed on Tuesday that they had opted to walk away from negotiations, claiming United were demanding too much money. A Nike statement read: "Manchester United is a great club with passionate fans. We are proud to have partnered with them for the last 12 years and will continue to sponsor the club until the end of the 2014/15 season. "Any partnership with a club or federation has to be mutually beneficial and the terms that were on offer for a renewed contract did not represent good value for Nike's shareholders. "We look forward to a successful final season with the club." Some reports have suggested Adidas are now in pole position to step in and clinch a deal which could see the club earn £60million a year from 2015. Nike's original deal was worth £303million, with extra income from a profit share agreement from merchandise sold worldwide. On Monday, United unveiled their new home kit for the 2014-15 season - which will be the last designed by Nike and the first to bear the logo of new sponsor Chevrolet. United announced they would be entering a seven-year agreement - worth a reported £53million per season - with the US car giant from this summer back in 2012. Incoming manager Louis van Gaal will head to the United States after the World Cup to pick up the reins for the first time as United begin their overseas tour on July 18.	sports

Transfer news: Thomas Vermaelen set for Arsenal talks | Football365 | Premier League News	Thomas Vermaelen is set to meet with Arsenal to finalise his future, with Manchester United poised to step up their interest. Last Updated: 08/07/14 at 16:24 Post Comment Thomas Vermaelen: Set for Arsenal talks United are understood to be very keen on the 28-year-old defender, who has one year left on his contract at the Emirates Stadium. Vermaelen is Arsenal captain, but was limited to just seven league starts last season with Arsene Wenger preferring a centre-back pairing of Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker. Arsenal are keen to offer Vermaelen fresh terms, but the player is now set for talks and seems likely to seek a move away from the club he joined from Ajax in 2009. Now following Belgium's departure from the World Cup finals, Vermaelen is turning his attention to his future. "I really do not know where I will play, Arsenal or elsewhere next season," he is quoted by the Evening Standard. "All my attention went to the World Cup. I will see when I talk with Arsenal."	sports
Transfer news: Everton sign midfielder Gareth Barry on three-year deal | Football365 | Premier League News	Everton have signed midfielder Gareth Barry on a three-year deal following a successful loan spell last season. Last Updated: 09/07/14 at 00:18 Post Comment Gareth Barry: Joins Everton on three-year deal Barry, 33, spent last season on loan at Goodison Park from Manchester City and became a key figure for manager Roberto Martinez, making 37 appearances in total, forming a fine partnership with James McCarthy in the heart of the Everton midfield. The former England midfielder, who cost Everton £2million, had other options but decided to make his stay with the Toffees permanent, with the contract confirmed on the club's website. He is Martinez's first signing of the summer as the Spaniard looks to bolster his squad with possibly six new arrivals as he prepares for the additional demands of a Europa League campaign. Barry told evertontv: “I was really keen to get this sorted before the lads come back to training on Thursday. I'm delighted now that everything is signed and that I'm going to be spending the next few years at Everton. "When you are on loan, it is never the same as being a signed player. I was really settled last year - but now I am an official Everton player and it feels really good. "From the moment I signed last year I settled in straight away. There is a fantastic history here and it was brilliant working with the manager. "I have learned so much from him, it is a great set of players and the fans were fantastic last year - just everything about Everton feels right. The training ground, the facilities, the history - there is so much that is positive about the club." Martinez was delighted to have secured a player he believes has a key role to play in their future. "We all know the type of footballer that he is and the type of person that he is and he will fit perfectly well into what we are at Everton," he said. "Gareth is a model professional. He sets high standards in everything he does and that is the perfect model you want for your young players. "Add to that his experience on the football pitch and knowing how to win big games; he has that winning mentality and it is something I am delighted to bring into the side on a permanent basis. "It was not just about what he brings with his own performances, which are of the highest level, it is the influence he has with the other players. "We have got a very talented group of young footballers with big roles in the team already but you need direction and good guidance and leaders - Gareth fits into that group. "It is an exciting time with us involved in Europe, two domestic cup competitions and the league so we need a player of Gareth's experience and know-how. "We enjoyed having him as a loan player, but we will be enjoying having him even more knowing he is an Everton player."	sports

I am really excited to start playing for the club.” Koeman also feels the Tadic deal shows that Southampton have lost none of their ambition. He said: “It was very important to get this signing done – not only for me, but for the rest of the squad and for our fans. It’s fantastic news. “We’ve lost some good players but we want to continue the ambition and philosophy of the club, so it’s a great signal to have brought in our first player. “He’s a great player. I know him very well from Holland, where he had a great season last year. “We now look forward to bringing in more players because we want to continue and maybe even better what Southampton did last season.”	sports

Transfer News: Former England defender Ashley Cole signs two-year deal with Roma | Football365 | Premier League News	Former England defender Ashley Cole has signed for Roma on a Bosman free transfer. Last Updated: 08/07/14 at 14:08 Post Comment Ashley Cole: Was released by Chelsea at the end of the season The 33-year-old left-back, released by Chelsea this summer, has agreed a two-year deal with the option of a third.  Cole tweeted: "Will never forget my time in England was a pleasure, but now onto a new challenge." Sky Sports revealed on Sunday that Cole was to travel to Italy following successful negotiations between the Serie A club and the player's representative.  Cole, who announced his international retirement after being overlooked by Roy Hodgson for England’s ill-fated World Cup campaign, became a free agent along with Frank Lampard at the end of the season, after Chelsea opted not to renew their contracts. Cole's agent was involved in discussions with only foreign clubs, with Roma and sides in the MLS showing the strongest interest.  Lampard, meanwhile, told Sky Sports last week that he will also make a decision on his future shortly, with MLS side New York City the most likely destination following talks with the club last month. Cole signed for Chelsea in a controversial move from rivals Arsenal in 2006 for £5million and went on to make over 300 appearances for the club. He lifted the Premier League under Carlo Ancelotti in 2010, before clinching the 2012 Champions League under Roberto Di Matteo, as well as the 2013 Europa League with Rafa Benitez, and five FA Cups.

I'm delighted now that everything is signed and that I'm going to be spending the next few years at Everton. "When you are on loan, it is never the same as being a signed player.

The training ground, the facilities, the history - there is so much that is positive about the club."

"It is an exciting time with us involved in Europe, two domestic cup competitions and the league so we need a player of Gareth's experience and know-how.

Last Updated: 07/07/14 at 15:10 Post Comment Randy Lerner: Aston Villa owner is aiming to sell the Premier League club Lerner announced in May that he was looking for a buyer for Villa after eight years in control of the club. The American businessman has already had talks with Lambert about the ongoing situation but feels it is important that speculation over the future ownership of the club does not overshadow the build-up to the forthcoming season. "This statement is intended to provide clarity regarding the status of the sale announcement I made in early May," Lerner said. "Over the last eight weeks we conducted a targeted process during which we explored the sale of the club. "In advance of this process however, I committed to our manager to become completely focused on the upcoming season should there be no agreement to sell by the time players and coaches return to training. "Given that no agreement has, as of yet, been reached, I feel that it is time now to turn my full attention back to Villa matters at hand. "While the sale process has been productive and remains ongoing, my priority at this point in the summer, heading into the upcoming season, is that the Villa organisation's sole focus be football - undistracted by any sales process. "Reverting to common practice, I do not intend to comment further on a potential sale or related rumours unless and until I have reached a definitive agreement to sell, at which time I will be prompt and clear." Although Villa are on the market for potential buyers, the club have been busy during the off-season, signing midfielder Joe Cole and defender Philippe Senderos, as well as appointing Roy Keane as assistant manager.	sports

They are one of the biggest clubs in the world and the last time I played at Anfield I got chills when I heard ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’. I would like to listen to it all the time." Despite finishing eighth in the Premier League last season, Southampton endured an uncertain time following the resignation of popular chairman Nicola Cortese in January. Pochettino, Lambert, Lallana and Shaw have all left the club in the close-season and, speaking to Croatian publication Sportske Novosti, Lovren believes Southampton have subsequently fallen apart. He said: "I signed because the club had great ambition. Cortese and Pochettino convinced me to sign, gave me assurances about the project and incredible confidence, but when the chairman left and Pochettino was going too, as early as April, I realised things had fallen apart. "Honestly, I don’t know who the main man at the club is anymore. I’d gladly stay at Southampton if the club had any ambitions and if they kept the key players – not even the Liverpool bid would have dissuaded me if they had done that." Lovren was signed by Pochettino from Lyon last summer and has made 31 appearances for the Saints, scoring twice.	sports

Premier League: Albert Stuivenberg appointed assistant Manchester United coach | Football365 | Premier League News	New Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has added fellow Dutchman Albert Stuivenberg to his backroom staff at Old Trafford.

Transfer news: Sunderland striker Nacho Scocco wanted by Newell's Old Boys | Football365 | Premier League News	Newell’s Old Boys vice-president Jorge Ricobelli admits the club would like to bring Nacho Scocco back to Argentina from Sunderland. Last Updated: 05/07/14 at 14:31 Post Comment Nacho Scocco: Attracting interest from former employers Newell's Old Boys The 29-year-old started his career with Newell’s and, despite the forward returning to the Stadium of Light for pre-season training, Ricobelli insists Old Boys will continue their efforts to sign the one-cap Argentina international. Scocco made the switch to Sunderland from Brazilian side Internacional during the January transfer window, but made just six appearances for the Premier League club and failed to score. During a three-year spell at Newell’s, Scocco netted 16 goals in 76 appearances and a season-long loan from Al Ain saw the attacker score 24 times in just 33 matches. The Sunderland Echo quoted Ricobelli as saying: “It is our wish to sign Scocco. Nacho has to report back for training in Sunderland. “We have made some efforts, but he now needs to return to the club [Sunderland] so we can continue with talks and we will listen to whether Sunderland want to let Scocco leave. “We have no problem looking at either a loan or purchase, as long as it is within the means of our club.” Scocco has two years remaining on his contract with Sunderland but Ricobelli is determined to bring the player back to his boyhood club and claims it would be a major boost for Argentinian football. “The idea is to make the effort and analyse all the possibilities,” he added. “The expectation is real, but it is a difficult situation. If we manage to bring Nacho back, it will be a totally extraordinary situation.”	sports

Premier League: Leicester City manager Nigel Pearson refusing to get carried away | Football365 | Premier League News	Nigel Pearson: Leicester manager ready for Premier League campaign The Foxes gained promotion back to the top flight by claiming the Sky Bet Championship title with a club-record haul of 102 points last season. The club’s Thai owner was quoted after that as saying he is prepared to spend big to secure a top-five Premier League spot within the next three seasons. Pearson acknowledges there is an ambitious mood at the club, but the 50-year-old is keeping his feet on the ground. "I think there is a very positive feel about the club, but we have a realistic outlook as well," said Pearson, as his players began pre-season training on Monday. "The fashion in which we gained promotion was very positive, but ultimately, we have achieved that season's goals and now we have to move on from that and make sure we don't get carried away with the euphoria of last year's success." Pearson also played down the story about Leicester owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha targeting the top five inside three years, suggesting it was not entirely accurate. He said: "Well - given the way the managerial merry-go-round is these days - if in three years I'm still managing Leicester City, we will have continued to do well. "There is going to be speculation surrounding clubs and stories will surface. That is part and parcel of it. "But we are on the same page as a football club in terms of talking with the owners. "I'm delighted for them because they have invested a lot of time and finance in us to help us achieve our goals and getting into the Premier League. Now, we have to try to establish ourselves." Asked if he would take 17th place - and thus, survival - as a final position for the 2014-15 season if offered it at this stage, Pearson said: "If you want to establish yourselves, first and foremost, yes, it is about us retaining our status. "But if you speak to anybody here, including players, staff, fans, we aspire to be better than that. "We want to make sure we give a really good account of ourselves and that we continue to move the club forward. "We'll set targets internally, but I'm not going to be shouting it from the rooftops for the public." Pearson is hopeful that a new deal for forward David Nugent, the Foxes’ top scorer last term, will be concluded "very shortly", but he is keeping his cards close to his chest about current targets as he attempts to boost his strike-force. Sunderland's Connor Wickham, Cardiff's Fraizer Campbell and Brighton's Leonardo Ulloa have all been linked with Leicester. However, Pearson said: "I am aware of the talk about there being interest, and I'm not saying that is not the case. "But I'm certainly not prepared to talk about players who are already at a club. "It is right that we do our business in the way we always do, and when there is some more positive information, we will announce it."	sports
Premier League: Andros Townsend hopes to impress at Tottenham | Football365 | Premier League News	Tottenham winger Andros Townsend is hoping to make a flying start to the new Premier League campaign following a frustrating summer. Last Updated: 07/07/14 at 13:08 Post Comment Andros Townsend: Big season ahead for Tottenham winger The England international was forced to miss the World Cup after being sidelined by an ankle injury towards the end of last season. However, he is now hoping to impress new Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino as the former Southampton boss starts to put the squad through their paces at Enfield this week. "It is a big season for me. Last year was my breakthrough for club and country and now it is important I build on that and show a lot more consistency than I did last year," said Townsend. "I am 23 next week, so that will come with age, and hopefully I can build on what I did last season. "I did not get much holidays, but it was important for me to make sure I was 100 per cent fit coming back to training so I can be fit and impress the manager." Another Tottenham player hoping for a fresh start under Pochettino is Emmanuel Adebayor. The Togo forward was brought in from the cold by former boss Tim Sherwood last season and scored 11 goals. "My summer was great. The most important thing is to come back and train, to work hard," Adebayor said. "Nothing is personal - I play for Tottenham and we are a team. "So for me, our targets or objective is to finish in the top four, and I want to help the team finish in the top four."	sports

Transfer news: Arsenal close to signing Barcelona’s Alexis Sanchez and Newcastle's Mathieu Debuchy | News	Arsenal could spend around £40million this week on the capture of Barcelona’s Alexis Sanchez and Newcastle’s Mathieu Debuchy, according to Sky sources. Last Updated: 08/07/14 at 20:52 Post Comment Alexis Sanchez: Arsenal confident of signing striker Sky Sports News understands Arsenal are very confident of signing Chile international striker Sanchez for around £30million. Sanchez had been linked with a move to Liverpool and Juventus but Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger looks set to add the highly-rated Barca man to his striking options. Full-back Debuchy, meanwhile, is set to join the club for around £10m in the next 48 hours as Wenger fills the void left by the departure of Bacary Sagna to Manchester City. Debuchy was preferred to Sagna by France boss Didier Deschamps throughout the World Cup. Debuchy, 28, has played 46 appearances for Newcastle, scoring once, since moving to the club from Lille for £5.5m in January 2013. Barcelona have believed to have bowed to Sanchez's wish to leave and move to London rather than Liverpool, where he could have been used as a makeweight in a potential deal for Luis Suarez. The signing of Sanchez would present another major move by Arsenal, who smashed their transfer record at the end of last year's summer window to bring in Mesut Ozil from Real Madrid. A defensive midfielder is also said to be on Wenger's wanted list, with Lars Bender at Bayer Leverkusen reportedly a long-term target. Arsenal also released several players at the end of their contracts, including striker Nicklas Bendtner. The Denmark forward has several options, reported to be both from within the Premier League as well as European sides. Arsenal step up their pre-season schedule in New York at the end of the month ahead of hosting the Emirates Cup and the FA Community Shield against Manchester City at Wembley on August 10.	sports

What's Wrong With Sturridge On His Own Up Front? | Football365 | Opinion | Mailbox	Latest Articles One chap in the mailbox suspects mischief at Anfield over Luis Suarez's proposed move to Barcelona. Plus, more on the Reds becoming the new Tottenham... Will selling Elvis and buying The Beatles work better for Liverpool than it did for Spurs? Plus, Lazar Markovic's record compares rather unfavourably to Bebe's... If you have anything to say on any subject, mail us at theeditor@fooball365.com Wanting Liverpool To 'Do A Spurs' I'm finding interesting that people presuming Liverpool will 'do a Tottenham' next year after signing a few decent players to replace one world class player. As if Tottenham went from challengers to relegation fodder. Last season, Tottenham finished with 3 fewer points and one place lower than they did the year before. If Liverpool can finish with 81 points and finish 3rd next year, I'll be quite happy to be honest. Gary Orford, LFC ...In response to the various emails discussing "Liverpool doing a Spurs". Personally I wouldn't be too upset if, having sold their best and most creative player, Liverpool, like Spurs, finished 1 place lower in the following season. I'd take third now if offered. Rob Smith ...The way everybody is predicting that Liverpool will 'do a Spurs' I had to double-check that the Londoners didn't get relegated last season. And what did I find? They dropped 3 points and a single spot on the table to sixth from the previous season. Not the improvement they hoped for, but not the disaster it's remembered as. If that's the sum total of the devastation wrought on Liverpool after Suarez goes I'd be content enough. Damien, Belfast (still need some new fullbacks though) Liverpool Can Play One Up Front Recently in the mailbox and in other places, I've seen lots of people saying that Liverpool need to buy a proper world class forward to replace Suarez. This may seem insane on my part but do they really need to? Yes, by losing Suarez Liverpool are losing about 45 goals + assists a season but I would argue that this now presents them with a very good opportunity to solidify their team by changing system. In a way, it was both a blessing and a curse that Brendan Rodgers had both Sturridge and Suarez, as having 2 brilliant strikers necessitated him playing 2 up front, which worked to an extent but was a massive contributing factor in Liverpool's inability to defend. Rather than looking to directly replace Suarez, Liverpool would probably be better off playing with just Sturridge up front and putting an extra midfielder in the team, rather than looking to splash out on Falcao etc. Whilst obviously I can't read Brendan Rodgers' mind, it seems that his moves in the transfer market would indicate he's considering something similar. Before Barcelona moved for Suarez, I was wondering where Lallana was going to play but now it's not hard to imagine a fluid 3 of him, Sterling and Coutinho/Markovic operating behind Sturridge with Gerrard and Henderson holding. While it's going to take some time to adjust to the loss of Suarez, in the long run Liverpool could end up marginally better off. They shouldn't concede as many goals playing like that (it would be gruesome if they were to try and play 2 up top in the latter stages of the Champions League) and it's not beyond the realms of possibility that Sturridge could step up and hit 30+ goals if he were to be the main striker. This is all conjecture at the moment though so I wouldn't be surprised to see Liverpool splash out £50m on Cavani! Brett (the more pertinent question is why aren't they buying any defenders), AFC He Got Three, But Point Still Sort Of Stands It is correct that Bebé is a striker and Markovic is a winger. You would think then that by playing as a winger/attacking midfielder in that Benfica (won the league by 7 points) team surrounded by far "higher calibre" players that the ones on offer at Paços de Ferreira (avoided relegation by 3 points) he would be chipping in with a fair few assists? Lazar Markovic assists 2013/14- 0. Zilch. Nada You also mention that Markovic is only 20 and Bebé is 23. Whilst that is undisputable, I think it should be taken into consideration that in terms of footballing development, while Markovic has been brought through academies since the age of 12, Bebé (through his well documented upbringing and lack of a proper home) only started playing with a proper club at the age of 19 and, due to a combination of injury and being Bebé, last season was his first proper crack at the whip in terms of being a starter in a proper league. As much as it may appear this is not a slight on Liverpool FC or its fans famous grasp of transfer related maths, it isn't. It's rather a slight on the state of the transfer market where £25m for a player of Markovic's quality becoming the norm. To put it another way- it seems bizarre that Markovic will be costing nearly 4x the amount of Origi, despite having had near identical seasons (30 appearances, 5 goals, 0 assists) in a similarly competitive league. Scott, Manchester Save Holtby Out of interest, how is Daniel Storey party to how highly Pochettino rates the Spurs players? And why would Holtby, a central midfielder, worry about the presence of wingers (Chadli and Townsend) in the squad? A quite bizarre inclusion, it has to be said. Holtby is highly rated by everyone I've spoken to at Spurs (fan-wise), probably has more energy than the rest of our midfield put together (definitely more enthusiasm), and seems like a keen learner. All in all, I'd expect him to fit the Pochettino mould far more than Sigurdsson, Paulinho, and possibly even Dembele for example. I doubt you could find me many Spurs fans who wouldn't be upset if Fritz was sold, when we could have a Van der Vaart mk II on our hands. Silly Mr Storey. Alex G, THFC (seems like a lovely chap too) (MC - It was more based on the fact he has been loaned out to a relagated side where he didn't impress, and at 23 needs to be playing regularly. No slight on the man, who does indeed seem a lovely chap) McCormack Madness I can't decide whether to Ross McCormack's transfer to Leeds is hilarious or depressing. Fresh from last season's ridiculousness where Harry "bare bones" Redknapp seemed to spend most of August acquiring more and more highly priced players, despite the club having already recklessly splurged cash in the Premier League the previous season, Fulham seem determined to demonstrate to the entire world just how ridiculous the Championship has now become. For as they lay out £11m for a 27 year old striker with a modestly good Championship goal record, the rest of the clubs in that division have to learn to adhere to "Financial Fair Play" regulations, sensibly restricting their spending relative to their operating budgets. Quite what is supposed to be "fair" about the three relegated clubs receiving more money in parachute payments than the rest of the division receives as their total share of the TV money, is beyond me. Jack Saunders (Ipswich Town for 7th!) Suarez WILL Miss Liverpool Chris Bascombe's article about how Suarez will miss Liverpool is ridiculous, and Mediawatch was right to lampoon it - but I think he's right. Suarez will miss Liverpool, just like Torres has admitted recently. Barcelona fans are outraged at the new President's decisions. There are many things that Bartomeu has done since being appointed that have annoyed Barca fans, and signing Suarez for a record fee when they would seemingly rather sign Falcao or Aguero is the biggest one. Local fans apparently would rather keep a La Masia-based team than buying the likes of Suarez, and after big names like Sanchez and Ibrahimovic have failed in previous years, its hard to blame them. That is before you even consider moral issues with Suarez's biting and the Evra incident. I wish Suarez would realize how good he has it at Liverpool and stay, but I've come to terms with the fact that it makes sense to let him leave, especially for 75m GBP. I'll miss him, I've never watched anyone remotely as good at football as him play in real life (seen Messi in 2 games live but unfortunately he didn't do much). But Suarez will miss Anfield too, even if he does well at Barcelona. Oliver (He won't miss the English press, though.) Dziggel, Geneva Switzerland Okay...

Is Suarez's Barca Move A Liverpool Ploy? | Football365 | Opinion | Mailbox	Latest Articles 'Do Liverpool need to replace Suarez?' is the question raised by one mailboxer, whilst we also have thoughts on Markovic, McCormack, Fulham and 'doing a Spurs'... Will selling Elvis and buying The Beatles work better for Liverpool than it did for Spurs? Plus, Lazar Markovic's record compares rather unfavourably to Bebe's... If you have anything to say on any subject, mail us at theeditor@fooball365.com Why Didn't Liverpool Move For Cole? I can't be the only Liverpool fan wondering why on earth we've let Roma nab Ashley Cole? We're crying out for a decent left back with Champions League experience who can help organise our flaky defence. Kudos to the guy for expanding his horizons and all but surely we could have made a compelling offer? If we end up with Ryan Bertrand there can be no denying we've gone a bit 'Spurs'. All very worrying. Will, LFC Not Impressed By Pool's Spending This might be a bit late for the morning mailbox but I wanted to agree with Jo's email from yesterday but approach it from a different angle. In Jo's analogy he says they are buying a "host of exciting players from across Europe", which I believe is precisely what Liverpool are not doing. They did exceptionally well last year and had a great system and team spirit which clearly worked, however, the most crucial part of this team looks like he will be leaving. Do Liverpool fans really believe that Lambert and Origi are going to be able to cover the goals left by Suarez next year? Not to mention the assists? We have seen how difficult it is to break in to the top four and I just don't think Liverpool will be there next year. Next part of the team - midfield. Can looks half decent but I am not even sure he is going to be a starter, good squad player I think. The other two are the ones I'm concerned about, Lallana and Markovic. Firstly, to spend £25m on a player who seemingly underperformed Bebe last year looks absolutely mental, and whilst Lallana is a good player does he have the pace to fit this Liverpool system? It looks likely one of them will be a £25m sub anyway as I can't see Sterling shifting too much. Finally, Lovren. Is he really better than Agger? I don't think so. Essentially my point is that whilst Liverpool are adding much needed depth, their first XI will not be anywhere near as strong as next year. For Lallana and Markovic surely they should be looking at someone like Falcao or another world class forward, or perhaps trying to find a long term replacement for Gerrard? Can't wait for the Scouce responses to this (I support Sheffield United by the way, digs welcome). Jack ...Have to agree to an extent with Scott, Manchester on Liverpool looking worryingly like Spurs (except that Liverpool won't get a fee to match Bale's for Suarez, even though he'd be worth it). A lot of the guys being signed seem quite mediocre for the price they're (supposedly) being signed for. I don't think the comparison with what happened to AVB is fair though because in fairness to him, he didn't deserve to be sacked when he was in my opinion, in spite of the money he spent. Spurs were (slightly) better than they were the previous season, just not by as much as they possibly should have been given the financial investment they'd made. I think AVB should have been given the whole season to prove himself though given that that many new players aren't going to bed in straight away and I'm confident, barring a disaster of Moyesian proportions, that Rodgers will still be the manager of Liverpool on the last day of the season at which point his successes or failures in the transfer market can be properly assessed. Given his mixed record in that respect to date though, I'm a little worried. John, Dublin Ploy Has it not occurred to anyone else, that maybe this is all just a ploy. A cunning plan thought up by Brendan Rodgers and the Liverpool hierarchy. Offer Luis Suarez to Barcelona, who use their considerable influence within Fifa (which we all know they've got) to reduce/remove his ban; then drag on the transfer process until finally informing Barcelona that their offer wasn't nearly good enough. I know it sounds far fetched - I mean it did all come to me last night in a dream - but think about it. Why hasn't there been a single quote from Brendan Rodgers regarding the Suarez transfer, or even the biting incident? He did receive an honorary degree from the University of Ulster recently, so its not as if he's disappeared off the face of the Earth. A deal of around £63m has been mentioned, but its way below his valuation. Also, why would Suarez want to leave Liverpool after last season? He scored more Premier league goals from open play than anyone in the modern era, really enjoyed his football for once, got rid of the diving and play acting and swept up every award there was. At a club level, Liverpool agonizingly missed out on the title, but with guaranteed Champions league football can now improve on what is still a very young but immensely talented squad, to challenge on all four fronts next season. But without Suarez it all falls apart. I tried convincing myself after the biting incident that Liverpool don't need him, and that we'd be just fine without him; but I watched all his goals last night over and over again marveling at the sheer brilliance of the man. He is one of only three players in the world who is irreplaceable, in my opinion. How will Rodgers begin to replace the 31 goals he scored (no penalties!) last season? With Origi? Sanchez? It is simply not possible. Surely working with Suarez for the last couple of years he knows that better than anyone. Ian Rosario (If he does leave, blow it all on James Rodrigues. That boy is going to be some player) Tractor Boys OK, there were some acceptable points raised by Shaun, Livingston, so I'll concede to him the draw and agree we were both right to an extent, but he delivered a low blow at the end. Personally I have little to no recollection of the events of that Saturday afternoon on 4th March 1995, (I think it was round about then), none whatsoever, I don't even think about it every single time I see a team go 6 or 7 up, but it's a little harsh reminding other Ipswich fans who read the famous Mailbox when it's just me being a twunt, not everyone is as resolute as I am. Just to prove I don't care I'm off to the shed with my 'Escape to Victory' DVD, before I turn my support to Die Deutschen later tonight. Chris ITFC, (Can't believe they are thinking of remaking that film, I mean who from the Ipswich Team will they pick this time around?) Liverpool Higher Calibre Scott, Manchester points out that Bebe has out-scored Markovic and thus the Markovic price tag must be an act of lunacy. I think the key difference is that Markovic is only 20 so has development still to come. Bebe is a striker too whilst Markovic is a winger so not sure the comparison is fair. I can't agree or disagree regarding the Liverpool buying spree and whether or not it makes sense but I like that we have signed a couple of experienced premier league players. Hopefully neither of them will need time to settle and Lallana is tactically versatile which makes me think he and Sterling will works wonders behind Sturridge. Can looks pretty cool and will balance out the largely unattractive Skrtel/Lucas axis we've got going on too and everyone knows a good squad needs a balance. I'd also argue that having champions league football might help Liverpool attract a higher calibre of player. That's obviously why we keep getting linked with Ryan Bertrand. Minty, LFC ...I'd pay £25million for Lazar Markovic. He looks like Alessandro Nesta in his halcyon Lazio days (in a team that should be much more fondly remembered than it is). If Rodgers insists that Skrtel grows a slightly kitsch goatee, and gives somebody a Nedved wig, Liverpool would make me very happy to watch. Chris MUFC In Defence Of Liverpool's Transfers I feel that saying Liverpool are doing a Spurs does us a bit of a disservice if I'm honest. I know people want to revel in the notion that us losing Suarez and bringing in exciting, young talent means that their club will become relevant in terms of the upper echelon again. Let's analyse the situation. Spurs sell Bale and bring in some of the much-vaunted, populist choices in Lamela, Capoue, Paulinho and Soldado. Sometimes I wonder whether if Levy does transfer business based on red top reports the way he goes after targets. He threw as many good players as he can who are totally unsuited to the way AVB wanted his teams to set up Liverpool are selling Suarez and have already brought in players from teams who are familiar with our way of playing. Lambert and Lallana are used to quick transitions in attack and are technically good. Can is an athletic and strong central midfielder who should suit a quick counter game. Lovren is, from what I've seen, very good 1v1 and that was one of the things lacking from our defence last year. Will admit I don't see a lot of Portuguese football but the profile for Markovic is promising: a quick technically proficient attacker should suit us just fine. I think it's quite clear that we have definite ideas of the traits we're after in our signings and we're not just scatter gunning our way through £80m. Every transfer is a gamble but we're trying to play it as smart as we can, not just seeing what s**t sticks to the wall a la Levy. Kris, LFC, Manchester ...After having sold Bale, Spurs dropped by three points from their previous season's tally. If Liverpool were to do a Spurs and get 81 points, I will take that every day of the week. Yathaid, LFC On English Youngsters It is well documented that young English players are getting very few opportunities to play and develop their talents in the Premier League. A lot of blame has been bandied around to different sources (always expected after England go out of a major tournament of course) but I am a firm believer that a huge portion of the problem is down to the nature of the hiring and firing of managers in the Premier League and the pressure cooker environment this creates. It is far too much of a risk for any manager to pick younger up and coming players ahead of vital knowhow and experience regardless of what country they are from and if they can get it cheaper elsewhere then of course they will it is a no brainer... If they make those kind of decisions and they go wrongly and they lose/get relegated it is their c*ck on the block and they get fired. Most clubs/managers have a budget to work to and most are forced to work within their means. Managers are under far too much scrutiny over their every decision so they are not likely to be able to take risks with their jobs at stake. I think it may be possible for a minimum term contract to be put in place for any manager taking over a new club and the club must stick to it and set out a long term plan which would include youth set ups, coaching, scouting plans etc. and it could possibly be regulated by the FA/Premier League and possibly beyond. I am not sure how this would work in truth but I would say it is definitely achievable and a club must give a damn good reason to be able to get out of this contract with stiff punishments for those who so. Even Fergie in his later years was reluctant to blood many youngsters as United were under severe pressure from Chelsea and City. The Pogba issue is a (painful) case in point but long gone are the days when a manager is given a 5 year plan where they can develop teams including youngsters where mistakes are expected/tolerated and this can only have a detrimental effect on the International team. Never win with kids eh? Maybe Alan Hansen was right all those years ago he was just on about the wrong decade. I am sure there could be potential flaws to this but rather than trying to curb foreign imports I think we should be looking to give managers a platform from which they are able to play these players instead of shopping for the cheaper tried and tested options from abroad.

What's Wrong With Sturridge On His Own Up Front? | Football365 | Opinion | Mailbox	Latest Articles One chap in the mailbox suspects mischief at Anfield over Luis Suarez's proposed move to Barcelona. Plus, more on the Reds becoming the new Tottenham... Will selling Elvis and buying The Beatles work better for Liverpool than it did for Spurs? Plus, Lazar Markovic's record compares rather unfavourably to Bebe's... If you have anything to say on any subject, mail us at theeditor@fooball365.com Wanting Liverpool To 'Do A Spurs' I'm finding interesting that people presuming Liverpool will 'do a Tottenham' next year after signing a few decent players to replace one world class player. As if Tottenham went from challengers to relegation fodder. Last season, Tottenham finished with 3 fewer points and one place lower than they did the year before. If Liverpool can finish with 81 points and finish 3rd next year, I'll be quite happy to be honest. Gary Orford, LFC ...In response to the various emails discussing "Liverpool doing a Spurs". Personally I wouldn't be too upset if, having sold their best and most creative player, Liverpool, like Spurs, finished 1 place lower in the following season. I'd take third now if offered. Rob Smith ...The way everybody is predicting that Liverpool will 'do a Spurs' I had to double-check that the Londoners didn't get relegated last season. And what did I find? They dropped 3 points and a single spot on the table to sixth from the previous season. Not the improvement they hoped for, but not the disaster it's remembered as. If that's the sum total of the devastation wrought on Liverpool after Suarez goes I'd be content enough. Damien, Belfast (still need some new fullbacks though) Liverpool Can Play One Up Front Recently in the mailbox and in other places, I've seen lots of people saying that Liverpool need to buy a proper world class forward to replace Suarez. This may seem insane on my part but do they really need to? Yes, by losing Suarez Liverpool are losing about 45 goals + assists a season but I would argue that this now presents them with a very good opportunity to solidify their team by changing system. In a way, it was both a blessing and a curse that Brendan Rodgers had both Sturridge and Suarez, as having 2 brilliant strikers necessitated him playing 2 up front, which worked to an extent but was a massive contributing factor in Liverpool's inability to defend. Rather than looking to directly replace Suarez, Liverpool would probably be better off playing with just Sturridge up front and putting an extra midfielder in the team, rather than looking to splash out on Falcao etc. Whilst obviously I can't read Brendan Rodgers' mind, it seems that his moves in the transfer market would indicate he's considering something similar. Before Barcelona moved for Suarez, I was wondering where Lallana was going to play but now it's not hard to imagine a fluid 3 of him, Sterling and Coutinho/Markovic operating behind Sturridge with Gerrard and Henderson holding. While it's going to take some time to adjust to the loss of Suarez, in the long run Liverpool could end up marginally better off. They shouldn't concede as many goals playing like that (it would be gruesome if they were to try and play 2 up top in the latter stages of the Champions League) and it's not beyond the realms of possibility that Sturridge could step up and hit 30+ goals if he were to be the main striker. This is all conjecture at the moment though so I wouldn't be surprised to see Liverpool splash out £50m on Cavani! Brett (the more pertinent question is why aren't they buying any defenders), AFC He Got Three, But Point Still Sort Of Stands It is correct that Bebé is a striker and Markovic is a winger. You would think then that by playing as a winger/attacking midfielder in that Benfica (won the league by 7 points) team surrounded by far "higher calibre" players that the ones on offer at Paços de Ferreira (avoided relegation by 3 points) he would be chipping in with a fair few assists? Lazar Markovic assists 2013/14- 0. Zilch. Nada You also mention that Markovic is only 20 and Bebé is 23. Whilst that is undisputable, I think it should be taken into consideration that in terms of footballing development, while Markovic has been brought through academies since the age of 12, Bebé (through his well documented upbringing and lack of a proper home) only started playing with a proper club at the age of 19 and, due to a combination of injury and being Bebé, last season was his first proper crack at the whip in terms of being a starter in a proper league. As much as it may appear this is not a slight on Liverpool FC or its fans famous grasp of transfer related maths, it isn't. It's rather a slight on the state of the transfer market where £25m for a player of Markovic's quality becoming the norm. To put it another way- it seems bizarre that Markovic will be costing nearly 4x the amount of Origi, despite having had near identical seasons (30 appearances, 5 goals, 0 assists) in a similarly competitive league. Scott, Manchester Save Holtby Out of interest, how is Daniel Storey party to how highly Pochettino rates the Spurs players? And why would Holtby, a central midfielder, worry about the presence of wingers (Chadli and Townsend) in the squad? A quite bizarre inclusion, it has to be said.

I think it's quite clear that we have definite ideas of the traits we're after in our signings and we're not just scatter gunning our way through £80m. Every transfer is a gamble but we're trying to play it as smart as we can, not just seeing what s**t sticks to the wall a la Levy. Kris, LFC, Manchester ...After having sold Bale, Spurs dropped by three points from their previous season's tally. If Liverpool were to do a Spurs and get 81 points, I will take that every day of the week. Yathaid, LFC On English Youngsters It is well documented that young English players are getting very few opportunities to play and develop their talents in the Premier League. A lot of blame has been bandied around to different sources (always expected after England go out of a major tournament of course) but I am a firm believer that a huge portion of the problem is down to the nature of the hiring and firing of managers in the Premier League and the pressure cooker environment this creates. It is far too much of a risk for any manager to pick younger up and coming players ahead of vital knowhow and experience regardless of what country they are from and if they can get it cheaper elsewhere then of course they will it is a no brainer... If they make those kind of decisions and they go wrongly and they lose/get relegated it is their c*ck on the block and they get fired. Most clubs/managers have a budget to work to and most are forced to work within their means. Managers are under far too much scrutiny over their every decision so they are not likely to be able to take risks with their jobs at stake. I think it may be possible for a minimum term contract to be put in place for any manager taking over a new club and the club must stick to it and set out a long term plan which would include youth set ups, coaching, scouting plans etc. and it could possibly be regulated by the FA/Premier League and possibly beyond. I am not sure how this would work in truth but I would say it is definitely achievable and a club must give a damn good reason to be able to get out of this contract with stiff punishments for those who so. Even Fergie in his later years was reluctant to blood many youngsters as United were under severe pressure from Chelsea and City. The Pogba issue is a (painful) case in point but long gone are the days when a manager is given a 5 year plan where they can develop teams including youngsters where mistakes are expected/tolerated and this can only have a detrimental effect on the International team. Never win with kids eh? Maybe Alan Hansen was right all those years ago he was just on about the wrong decade. I am sure there could be potential flaws to this but rather than trying to curb foreign imports I think we should be looking to give managers a platform from which they are able to play these players instead of shopping for the cheaper tried and tested options from abroad.

Transfer news: Arsenal close to signing Barcelona’s Alexis Sanchez and Newcastle's Mathieu Debuchy | News	Arsenal could spend around £40million this week on the capture of Barcelona’s Alexis Sanchez and Newcastle’s Mathieu Debuchy, according to Sky sources. Last Updated: 08/07/14 at 20:52 Post Comment Alexis Sanchez: Arsenal confident of signing striker Sky Sports News understands Arsenal are very confident of signing Chile international striker Sanchez for around £30million. Sanchez had been linked with a move to Liverpool and Juventus but Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger looks set to add the highly-rated Barca man to his striking options. Full-back Debuchy, meanwhile, is set to join the club for around £10m in the next 48 hours as Wenger fills the void left by the departure of Bacary Sagna to Manchester City. Debuchy was preferred to Sagna by France boss Didier Deschamps throughout the World Cup. Debuchy, 28, has played 46 appearances for Newcastle, scoring once, since moving to the club from Lille for £5.5m in January 2013. Barcelona have believed to have bowed to Sanchez's wish to leave and move to London rather than Liverpool, where he could have been used as a makeweight in a potential deal for Luis Suarez. The signing of Sanchez would present another major move by Arsenal, who smashed their transfer record at the end of last year's summer window to bring in Mesut Ozil from Real Madrid. A defensive midfielder is also said to be on Wenger's wanted list, with Lars Bender at Bayer Leverkusen reportedly a long-term target. Arsenal also released several players at the end of their contracts, including striker Nicklas Bendtner. The Denmark forward has several options, reported to be both from within the Premier League as well as European sides. Arsenal step up their pre-season schedule in New York at the end of the month ahead of hosting the Emirates Cup and the FA Community Shield against Manchester City at Wembley on August 10.	sports

World Cup Venues - ESPN FC	Snapshot: Along with Cuiaba, Manaus is most often appointed the "white elephant" of the 2014 World Cup. It is easy to see why. The best local club, Nacional, plays in Serie D and is watched by hundreds (on a good day) rather than thousands of fans, making the long-term prospects of the Arena Amazonia somewhat doubtful. But Manaus has a population of almost 2 million people, and the region represents almost 43 percent of the land mass of the country. Manaus is located in the middle of the rain forest, better served by river than road. The bustling docks area is always good fun, and the famed Teatro Amazonas (opera house), built at the height of the rubber boom, is unmissable. Boat trips up the river and into the jungle start from Manaus too. Getting there: Manaus is around 2,700 miles by road from Rio de Janeiro -- and it would not be advised to travel by car as the roads in the surrounding area are not well developed. Instead, a flight to Manaus' Eduardo Gomes International Airport is the most practical option; the journey takes four hours from Rio de Janeiro. With its location on the main avenue (Av. Constantino Nery) of the city and less than 3 miles from the old city centre, getting to the stadium should not be a problem, although beware the heat if you want to walk from your hotel as the average high temperature is 88 degrees Fahrenheit (31 degrees Celsius) with the humidity at times overwhelming. Where/what to eat: Forget barbecues and feijoada, the bean stew so famously associated to Brazil. Amazonian gastronomy will impress thanks to its access to unique ingredients. Fish (peixe) dishes are a must, given that more than 2,000 species inhabit the Amazon River (tambaqui and pacu are the most renowned varieties), but a lot of cassava-based stews are also popular. Exotic fruits like cupuacu, which tastes similar to a combination of pear and pineapple, are a treat for the untrained taste buds, while the now-mainstream superfood acai can be a refreshing alternative for the warmer times of the day. Banzeiro (Rua Teresina, 102) has a glowing reputation among locals, with the setting simple but the food and service top class. The Portuguese Alentejo (Rua Para, 555) excels with its cod dishes. Shin Surazan (Joao Valerio, 762) offers fantastic sushi with an eclectic mix of river food. Where/what to drink: Soak up the atmosphere at O Chefao (Rua Ferreira Pena, 50), where the decor is inspired by "The Godfather." Boasting a decent beer list, O Chefao also offers excellent sharing platters of such things as cheese and beef that make for a social evening out. At Bar do Armando (Rua 10 de Julho, 593), you can drink caipirinha lime with rum while observing passers-by on the seats outside. Fresh, cold beer is also in good supply, as are the cheese and ham sandwiches. Bar do Armando, in the centre of the city, guarantees cold beer, great appetisers and a full house every night. Manaus is surrounded by the lush green of the Amazon rain forest. Where to stay: The majority of the city's accommodations is located in the urban sprawl rather than in the rain forest itself -- although it is certainly possible to sleep amid the trees in one of the many lodges or pricier and plusher eco resorts. If you are feeling less adventurous, the Adrianopolis neighbourhood would be a wise bet as it is close to most of the sights. Area trivia: The now-retired Francisco Lima was born in Manaus and went on to represent a number of clubs across the globe. The defensive midfielder's clubs included FC Zurich, Lecce, Bologna, Roma, Lokomotiv Moscow and the San Jose Earthquakes before he returned to his hometown to feature for Nacional, Rio Negro and Sao Raimundo. Sightseeing: The Arena Amazonia is located in arguably the most important city in Brazil's Amazon region. Manaus is steeped in history, given its tales of pomp and doom following its role in the frenzy for rubber at the end of the 19th century. While the world's biggest rain forest is undoubtedly a tourist magnet, the capital of the Amazonas state has been eager to boost its image as a modern urban centre. The Amazonas Theatre is an impressive sight, dating from Manaus' golden age. If a concert coincides with your visit, do consider attending. If not, then perhaps take a guided tour. Meanwhile, the Mercado Municipal (Municipal Market) boasts a fine array of produce, food and souvenirs displayed in an impressive setting that has plenty of character. Adolpho Ducke's Botanical Garden, the small but interesting Tropical Zoo and the Natural History Museum will give you a great overview regarding the biodiversity of Amazonia. Definitely put time aside for at least a one-day trip to the rain forest, while the meeting of the waters, where the Rio Negro and Amazon River combine, is a captivating phenomenon. Consult your hotel about guided tours to these attractions. Arena Amazonia is to be opened: 2013 Matches to be played at Arena Amazonia: England vs. Italy (June 14), Cameroon vs. Croatia (June 18), USA vs. Portugal (June 22), Honduras vs. Switzerland (June 25). Capacity: 42,374 Cost: Estimates range from 500 million to 600 million reals ($230-275 million, 140-170 million pounds). Stadium history: The Arena Amazonia is situated in the place of the Vivaldao stadium, which after opening in 1970 was demolished in 2011 to make way for its more futuristic successor. The biggest local side is Nacional, who were founded in 1913. Stadium trivia: The ground is located in the Amazon rain forest, making for a stunning and unique setting. Being so close to nature, consideration for the environment has been at the forefront of the stadium's build, with a system in place so that rainwater is captured and reused to water the pitch or supply the restrooms. After the tournament has finished, the venue will, according to FIFA, host concerts and cultural events. However, reports in September claimed the venue could be used as a detention centre.

Netherlands vs. Argentina: 50-50 Challenge - ESPN FC	It's a repeat of the 1978 World Cup final as the Netherlands face Argentina in Sao Paulo on Wednesday, with just one more match between the teams and a place at the Maracana. The Netherlands reached the final in 2010 while Argentina, winners 36 years ago, are in the semifinals for the fourth time in their history. Elko Born (Netherlands) and Sam Kelly (Argentina) preview the clash. Sum up your tournament so far Elko Born: The tournament has been a dream so far, with everything going right at exactly the right moment, from Robin van Persie's wonder goal in the first match to Arjen Robben's form and manager Louis van Gaal's audacious substitution against Costa Rica. There is almost a feeling the match against Argentina can hardly go wrong. Should the Argentines take the lead then surely Robben or Van Persie will step up or Van Gaal will come up with more magic. Sam Kelly: Historic. It's not been as free-scoring as Argentina would have liked and it's been very nervy at times, but the Rubicon has been crossed; for the first time since 1930, Argentina have reached a World Cup semifinal without either being the host nation (1978) or having Diego Maradona in the squad (1986 and 1990). And for the first time since losing the 1990 final -- the third World Cup final out of four that Argentina had featured in -- they've got past the quarters. It's not been all sunshine and roses. They've lost Angel Di Maria for the semifinal at least and there might be a minor concern about some of the finishing on Saturday, because in truth given how the game went, Argentina should probably have beaten Belgium by more than one goal. But key changes were made and worked, and key players who hadn't previously stepped up (I'm looking at you, Gonzalo Higuain) did so magnificently. Everything might finally be coming together. World Cup history between the two countries EB: There is, of course, Dennis Bergkamp's classic goal in the quarterfinal of the World Cup in 1998. But the most memorable match between the Netherlands and Argentina was played in 1978, when the countries faced each other in the final of the World Cup. The Netherlands, still disappointed from narrowly missing out on the ultimate prize in 1974, lost 2-1 after extra time and were once again left empty-handed. This, as you can imagine, has not been forgotten. Among fans and in the media, the word "revenge" is being tossed around. SK: This will be the fifth meeting between these nations at the World Cup. The Netherlands have won two -- a 4-0 win in Gelsenkirchen on their way to the final in 1974, and a 2-1 win in Marseille in 1998, decided by that brilliant Bergkamp effort as Elko says. The most recent meeting, during the 2006 group stage, brought the only competitive draw between the sides, a 0-0 in Frankfurt. Argentina's sole World Cup win -- indeed, their only win, because they've never won a friendly -- against the Netherlands was the 3-1 extra-time victory (it had finished 1-1 after 90 minutes) in the Estadio Monumental in the final of the 1978 World Cup. For most Argentines, 1978 is a tainted victory due to the military junta's attempts (very possibly successful) to swing things the home side's way. As such, taking out the Netherlands this time round could also be painted as a win over one of the darker parts of Argentina's own history (off the pitch as well as on it). What are your expectations for the rest of the tournament? EB: Ahead of the tournament most fans did not expect the Netherlands to get very far. Consequently, reaching the semifinal can already be seen as a huge success. But after a series of convincing victories, the Dutch now think they can win the World Cup and with the empowering feeling of confidence now instilled in the Oranje, it is difficult to simply dismiss this assertion completely. After the lost finals of 1974, 1978 and 2010, will it finally happen? Or is desire clouding judgement too much, and have the Dutch been a little lucky to get this far? - Macintosh: Van Gaal has gumption to spare SK: Two very tight semifinals but, just possibly, a more open final. As for how Argentina will do in their final two matches, they need to improve still, but the good news is that they already seem to have begun to step things up somewhat. Excellent in the first half against a Belgium side that offered them more space than they'd had in the previous round, they could have been further ahead but controlled the game pretty effectively even without the ball in the second half. Of the changes last time, Marcos Rojo should return from suspension to replace Jose Basanta at left-back, but Martin Demichelis will surely keep his place alongside Ezequiel Garay in the centre of defence; Demichelis looked far better than Federico Fernandez, and crucially Garay also looked more at ease with the experience of the Manchester City man alongside him. Given their potential for improvement and the fact they've done so in small bursts so far in the tournament, I think Argentina are narrow favourites for the semi -- particularly with Nigel de Jong injured for the Netherlands. Angel Di Maria's injury is a setback for Argentina, who have benefitted from the Real Madrid man's tireless running. Key battle EB: As one of the best footballers of the world, Lionel Messi is the man the Netherlands fear most, and without the injured defensive midfielder Nigel de Jong, the relatively inexperienced Dutch defence will have to be on their guard. In the case of Messi, though -- and in true Dutch fashion -- the best defence might be the attack. The battle between Argentina and the Netherlands will be a battle between Messi and Robben, the Netherlands' star man up front. On the day of the semifinal, who will perform best? And more importantly: Who will score the most goals? SK: Messi vs. Georginio Wijnaldum. In De Jong's absence, Wijnaldum (and Wesley Sneijder) seems likely to be asked to sit a little deeper in midfield to counter Messi's threat in front of the Dutch defence. If that sounds risky, it could well be; we saw in the first half against Belgium how much Messi finally enjoyed being given the space that came with having just one man marking him, as he produced some wonderful probing passes, including probably the through-ball of the finals so far to set Di Maria up for the shot from which the winger seemed to pick up his injury. It's clear -- all but impossible to deny -- that Argentina rely on Messi, and even with their bit-by-bit improvements so far, that's not likely to change here, particularly with Di Maria out of the equation. If Messi gets the space in midfield to pick up a head of steam on the ball, he could be very dangerous -- perhaps decisively so. Elsewhere on the pitch, how Marcos Rojo deals with Arjen Robben on the Dutch right/Argentine left will also prove important. - Vickery: Argentina fail to thrill Prediction EB: Having seen Dennis Bergkamp's wonder goal against Argentina in 1998 as a child, Robben or Van Persie will feel inspired to do something similar in the dying seconds of the match. The Netherlands will win 2-1. SK: It's very tight to call, but I'm going for Argentina to edge it by a goal again; if I were Dutch, the lack of bite in defensive midfield would be a worry coming up against Messi, while Argentina's own defensive errors were notably less of a problem with Demichelis stepping into the back line against Belgium.	sports
Brazil 1-7 Germany - World Cup hosts utterly humiliated in semfinal - ESPN FC	Brazil's dreams of making a return to a World Cup final in the Maracana were shattered in the most agonising manner as Germany inflicted on the hosts one of the most remarkable defeats in the 84-year history of this competition. Tears flowed like water in the Estadio Mineirao in Belo Horizonte as before even half-an-hour had gone, Brazil were 5-0 down, and the final scoreline was 7-1, equalling their worst-ever defeat, 6-0 to Uruguay back in 1920 before the World Cup had even begun. Brazil 1-7 Germany -- reaction - Marcotti: Scolari at a loss to explain - Jones: Seven stages of grief for Brazil - Duarte: Haunting defeat for the Selecao - Delaney: Three Points - Brazil broken by Germany - Low: German plan worked perfectly - Behind the Numbers: Germany's historic win - Photo Gallery: Best of Brazil vs. Germany - Klose breaks World Cup goals record | Highlight - Social reaction: Brazil, did that just happen? Two goals for Toni Kroos and Andre Schurrle , plus one each for Thomas Muller, Sami Khedira, and record-breaking 16th World Cup goal for Miroslav Klose saw the visitors delirious, while Brazil begins a period of soul-searching such as never before. Germany will go into Sunday's World Cup final at the Maracana to face Argentina or Holland on the highest of highs. The pain was so intense for Brazil, who had arrived at the Estadio Mineirao intent on honouring their missing talisman, Neymar. They tried to use his absence as an inspiration, parading slowly onto the field linked in crocodile formation, with stand-in captain David Luiz and goalkeeper Julio Cesar clutching Neymar's shirt as they belted out the national anthem. The opening period was always going to be a testing one for Germany, with the partisan crowd baying every Brazilian touch and tackle. Marcelo was cheered wildly after sending a 25-yard shot skimming a couple of yards wide, but there was a frantic feel to it, as though the Neymar emotion had spilled over into a frenzy, with Germany capable of punishing any slackness. That almost happened early on when Mesut Ozil delivered a sweet cross for Khedira to volley only for his shot to strike Kroos. A break by Khedira then led to the corner from which Germany took the lead in the 11th minute. Kroos took it, and it was straightforward enough but Brazil's marking went into meltdown and Muller slotted it home low past Julio Cesar while David Luiz beat the ground in frustration. Marcelo burst into the Germany penalty area and a pinpoint sliding tackle by Philipp Lahm stopped him in full stride but Brazil's high tempo only served to make them vulnerable on the break and Germany made them pay again, this time Klose becoming a World Cup's record-breaker. A delightful passing move saw Muller lay the ball off and although Julio Cesar stopped his first effort, Klose buried the rebound. Two minutes later and it was 3-0, Lahm's cross going all the way across the area for Kroos to slam home left-footed from 18 yards. Brazil's historic semifinal loss • Miroslav Klose now highest scorer in World Cup history with 16 goals. • Klose surpassed Brazilian striking legend Ronaldo to claim the record. • Germany scored five goals in 29 minutes, the fastest any team has ever done so in the World Cup. • Brazil had not conceded five goals in an entire World Cup since 1998. • The Selecao conceded 4 in 5 matches in 2010, 2 in 5 in 2006 and 4 in 7 in 2002. • Germany the first team to score five goals in a World Cup 1st half since Poland in 1974. • Brazil had never trailed by 4 goals in any World Cup match before today. (102 previous matches) • Germany now the all-time top scoring team in World Cup history with 221 goals. • Brazil the first host nation to lose a World Cup game by more than three goals.  Another two minutes, another goal. From a goal-kick Fernandinho was robbed by Khedira who unselfishly played in Kroos for a virtual tap-in for 4-0. By this time Brazil fans were in tears and a few leaving their seats, but the German machine marched on mercilessly. Less than half an hour gone and the hosts were 5-0 down. Mats Hummels strode forward and Ozil, who had come alive in this match, set up Khedira for a first-time finish. All over the pitch, in the stands, the executive box where FIFA president Sepp Blatter watched, in the Fan Fests on the beaches and those tens of millions tormented on TVs throughout Brazil, there was sheer disbelief. Scolari's half-time team talk must have been all about rescuing some pride, because it was a different Brazil who came out for the second half, with Paulinho on for the Fernandinho and Ramires for Hulk, with Low sending on Per Mertesacker for Hummels. Neuer had been barely tested in the first half but only he prevented Brazil getting on the scoresheet, first defying Oscar and then Paulinho. Julio Cesar had to be at his best to tip over Muller's curling effort from 25 yards, but Germany were not to be denied and Lahm's penetrating cross was struck home by substitute Schurrle. It was Chelsea midfielder Schurrle who piled on the agony, a breathtaking finish into the top corner after pulling down Muller's instinctive cross. Ozil should have made it an embarrassing eight but slid wide when through on goal before Oscar's crisp finish in the last minute provided a glimmer of light in the darkness. If Brazil wanted to erase the memories of that 1950 final defeat in the Maracana they have done so: this pain would have been infinitely more excruciating.	sports

Brazil's 7 stages of grief against Germany in the World Cup - ESPN FC	SAO PAULO -- The fireworks, blasts like cannons, were going off hours before the game. Not very many went off after. Anticipation had given way to humiliation, and by now this giant city seems to have accepted it. Brazil's historic defeat by the Germans might have been just bad enough to save us. There have been fears, spoken of surprisingly often and openly, about what terrible things would happen if Brazil failed to win this World Cup -- something seen by some here almost as a divine right, a function of pure destiny. Mostly, people had talked about how sideways the world might go if the hosts lost to the hated Argentines in the final. Then every clamp and governor that had been thrown onto this crackling country -- most of the pre-tournament anger having subsided once the games began -- would be released. In the absence of any reason for unity, a potentially violent division would return. It turns out a more decisive cataclysm was coming. Tens of thousands, fenced in by police and metal barricades, packed into the FIFA Fan Fest in Sao Paulo's downtown core before Tuesday night's game. There were concerts and banners and sloshing cups of beer, the familiar motions of celebration, but in truth it was already a kind of limited buoyancy. With Neymar's injury and Thiago Silva's suspension, local hopes had been muted. But they were still there, if under the surface. The anthem wasn't sung so much as it was shouted, and then the whistle blew. Brazil 1-7 Germany -- reaction - Marcotti: Scolari at a loss to explain - Jones: Seven stages of grief for Brazil - Duarte: Haunting defeat for the Selecao - Delaney: Three Points - Brazil broken by Germany - Low: German plan worked perfectly - Behind the Numbers: Germany's historic win - Photo Gallery: Best of Brazil vs. Germany - Klose breaks World Cup goals record | Highlight - Social reaction: Brazil, did that just happen? Then the Germans did what they did -- and so quickly -- with each of their seven goals serving as another of the makeshift stages of accelerated Brazilian grief. The first was met with anxiety, the second with anger, the third with disappointment, the fourth with disbelief. Then came bemusement, surprisingly enough -- some percentage of the thinning crowd that remained actually began cheering for the Germans -- and then understanding and finally acceptance. If there were still a bomb set to go off, the late Brazilian goal, that slim measure of pride, cut the last wire. By then, though, there was no longer any sense of real danger here, no feeling that riots were about to kick off. There were too many police, for starters, but more importantly, there wasn't really anything for the crowd to be angry about. This was a brutal defeat, but it contained no injustice or heartbreak. Brazil -- this Brazil -- just weren't good enough to win the World Cup, even given the advantages of home. They had barely beaten Chile, and they had struggled to hold on against the Colombians. Brazilians had remained hopeful their boys would continue to win, but it felt more and more as though they had stopped believing they would. After they had been made doubtless, they left and went home, or they stumbled into bars in search of one last commiserating drink. Some even thought to blow their air horns, almost ironic screams of defiance against the dark. Maybe the coming days will turn ugly, and fears will come true. Maybe this country will feel the way any of us does when houseguests linger too long. Maybe, for the first time in its history, Brazil will want the party to be over. But right now it doesn't feel that way. It doesn't feel like much of anything. Right now Sao Paulo feels like any other city in the world, except bigger, lit up, buzzing and perhaps even relieved to have joined the World Cup's ever expanding ranks of the abruptly detached.	sports
Marcotti: A shocking exit for Scolari and Brazil - ESPN FC	BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil -- Eventually, you run out of ideas. At 1-0, the yellow-clad population of the Estadio Mineirao groaned. A bloody nose, yes. But stick some cotton in and suck it up. At 2-0, there was incredulity. A young lady in the stands raised her hand, thumb in, digits extended over her open mouth. 3-0 and 4-0 were one and the same. Two stabs from Toni Kroos in the space of 69 seconds, the fastest brace in the history of the World Cup. Like burning yourself on a hot stove and then stubbing your toe when you jump away in pain. Hurt and more hurt. No time in between to react. But afterward, it was defiance. Chants of "Bra-sil! Bra-sil!" Not lame but full-throated, perhaps as a way of venting anger at the players. At 5-0, folks began to make their way to the exits. Twenty-nine minutes had passed. Read it again. TWENTY-NINE. But people had seen enough. It wasn't a majority, obviously, not even a significant plurality, but enough that you would notice. They filed away silently, looking away from the pitch, a yellow goo oozing toward the stairwells. Halftime was predictable: boos and cat-calls rained down mercilessly and echoed in the cavernous Mineirao. If, prior to kickoff, the ground's acoustics had amplified the Brazilians' sound, now -- after five goals -- it was a roar. At 6-0, the wrath seemed focused on one man. Fred, the mustachioed centre-forward who for the past weeks had flailed in carrying the torch passed on by the legendary Selecao strikers of yesteryear, from Ronaldo and Romario all the way back to Pele and Artur Friedenreich. In truth, the insults, expletives and bile vomited in his direction had begun at the start of the second half, perhaps when the realization he was still on the pitch hit. They rose to a crescendo after Andre Schurrle made it six, and Fred laconically made way for Willian. At 7-0, it was simple. They rose as one and offered up an ovation. Schurrle's goal -- his second -- was pretty, but it wasn't Diego Maradona-against-England-in-1986 pretty. Were they applauding him? The Germans? Were they being sarcastic? Was it all of the above? Or was this merely the last possible reaction they could think of, having exhausted all others? By the time Oscar fixed the final score at 7-1, there had been scuffles in the stands (at least five distinct ones -- all among Brazil fans -- visible from the press tribune). There had also been a period of "oles" at every German touch. Fans do this when they're well ahead, either to celebrate their own side's supremacy or to mock their opponent's futility ("See? They finally strung two passes together."). This was different. It was perhaps as unprecedented as a nation with five stars above its crest losing 7-1 at home in a World Cup semifinal. There is no script for this. It's virgin territory for everyone involved. You don't know how to react. Luiz Felipe Scolari, looking as if he had sailed with Charles Marlowe into the heart of darkness (only, instead of finding Kurtz, he found Kroos), insisted afterward that life goes on. It does. It just won't be the same. "We tried to do what we could, and we did what we thought was best," he said. "But in six or seven minutes, they scored three or four goals [four in six minutes actually, but you wouldn't blame the shell-shocked Scolari for getting it wrong], and they did it in an extraordinary manner. It was one after the other. We tried [from the bench] to talk to them, to get them to stop for a second, but we just could not." In a situation such as this, you wonder if it's even worthwhile talking about tactics. Schemes and formations, after all, often mutate after one goal, usually after two and, well, when you're 5-0 down inside the time it takes to watch a rerun of Glee, there really is no such thing anymore. Scolari was devoid of his best player, Neymar, and his captain and defensive stalwart, Thiago Silva, but to his credit, he didn't use the absences as an excuse. "It would have made no difference," he said. "What was Neymar going to do?" Scolari tried to channel emotions and turn a negative into a neutral or maybe even a positive. David Luiz and Julio Cesar held up the missing talisman's No. 10 jersey, and even the mascots ("player escorts," as FIFA like to call them) sang their little lungs out during a raucous rendition of the Brazilian anthem. Scolari had gone for the jugular, with the same 4-2-3-1 formation he's played throughout the tournament, which many thought he'd abandon against the Germans. Little Bernard, all 5-foot-5 of him, the hometown hero, slotted into the wing, with Oscar shifting inside while Fernandinho and the returning Luiz Gustavo were ready to do battle. There were moments in the first few minutes when it looked like the old-style 4-2-4 Vicente Feola might have used in 1958. But that lasted until the first German goal in the 11th minute, when David Luiz somehow lost Thomas Muller in the penalty box and gifted him the easiest of side-foot finishes from a few yards out. Scolari's dream of winning a second World Cup as Brazil coach ended in humiliating fashion. "Everything was organized, everything was calm until the goal was scored," Scolari said. "Then everything became disorganized, everything was panicked." For his part, Joachim Low offered up the same formation that beat France -- with Phillip Lahm tucked in at right-back -- but with one crucial tweak. When he saw Scolari's lineup, he shifted Sami Khedira from his role alongside Bastian Schweinsteiger in front of the back four to one further forward next to Kroos. 4-2-3-1 became 4-1-4-1 or, if you like your lingo, from triangle up to triangle down. Kroos-Khedira became a two-man gang of outlaws plundering the Brazilian passing lanes and scything their way past the feeble yellow barriers. They prompted the next four goals, including the one that allowed Miroslav Klose to become the all-time leading scorer in World Cup history by passing Ronaldo's mark of 15. "They suddenly were not so well organized, they were hitting long balls, and we took advantage," Low said. "We hit them with fast counterattacks, and we knew that it would cause them problems." The game was over at halftime, except for the record books that would record Schurrle's brace and Oscar's strike. (Don't call it a "consolation goal." Don't you dare.) Afterward, David Luiz apologized in a tearful television interview. Oscar was a fountain of tears too, alternately cuddled by Thiago Silva, himself bawling, and Schurrle, his club teammate. Julio Cesar said that, in place of this, he would much rather have lost 1-0 while making the mistake that cost his team the game. That way, there would only be one scapegoat. Brazil 1-7 Germany -- reaction - Marcotti: Scolari at a loss to explain - Jones: Seven stages of grief for Brazil - Duarte: Haunting defeat for the Selecao - Delaney: Three Points - Brazil broken by Germany - Low: German plan worked perfectly - Behind the Numbers: Germany's historic win - Photo Gallery: Best of Brazil vs. Germany - Klose breaks World Cup goals record | Highlight - Social reaction: Brazil, did that just happen? Instead, there are many. "I am responsible," Scolari said. "I pick the team, I prepare the team. Though if you ask my players, they will also say they're responsible because we are a team and we share victories and defeats. But for me, when I look at my life as a player, a coach, a teacher ... yes, it is the worst day of my life. I will be remembered as the man who lost 7-1 in Brazil in a World Cup semifinal." Low was as magnanimous as he could be, given the circumstances. After all, eight years ago, as Jurgen Klinsmann's assistant, he too saw his team come up short as host nation in a World Cup semifinal. "I know how Scolari feels," he said. "I remember 2006 and losing to Italy and the disappointment of a nation." He was being kind. As gut-wrenching as 2006 might have been to Germany, giving up a goal in the 119th minute of a match is not the same as giving up five within 30 minutes and losing 7-1, after 39 years of avoiding defeat in competitive matches on home soil. Low knows there isn't much you can take from this game, other than the result. His men found themselves in a freakish situation, they kept their heads, and they executed. If he's concerned about his troops being grounded and not getting carried away, he can take solace in the words of Kroos. "For a minute, we had trouble believing we were really 5-0 up," he said. "I mean, when do you ever win a semifinal 7-1?" "But we have one more game to go," he continued. "Nobody has ever become world champion in the semifinals." Those are the words of a young man who knows what he wants and knows how to get -- and they're just what Low wanted to hear. Germany and Brazil entered a Twilight Zone on Tuesday. One nation emerged to find itself 90 minutes from becoming champion of the world. The other has wounds that won't heal for a long time.

Three points - History made as Brazil broken by rampant Germany - ESPN FC	BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil -- Three thoughts on a record-breaking night as Brazil were humiliated by a rampant Germany side on the march towards the World Cup final.  1. An eternal embarrassment After so many goals, there was only one description: Minerazo. This was not as painfully dramatic as the 1950 loss to Uruguay -- forever remembered as the Maracanazo -- but that was only because it was possibly worse: It was so humiliatingly excruciating. The details of Germany's 7-1 win -- and the sheer numbers alone are searing -- remain difficult to register. It revealed so much that the first boos were not heard until the 44th minute, long after the fifth goal had been scored. It was as if that was how long it took for the utter shock to wear off, to realise just how bad this was. The dimensions to this defeat were as plentiful as Germany's goals. Given the history, the context, the politics, this may well be the most stunning World Cup match of all time. It is extremely difficult to think of a result or event that compares in football history as a whole. After a World Cup that Brazil had waited two generations for, they have now suffered a defeat that will take generations to forget. The circumstances are almost cruel. The scale of the defeat certainly was. The competition Brazil have dominated and won more than any other country has also left them with their two most painful defeats. They are of the type of defeats that very few victories can erode, that almost nothing can rectify. Brazil now has so much to consider. On their team bus for the World Cup, the message read: "Brace Yourself -- The Sixth is Coming." That took on dark tones. The game itself took on a scarcely believable gloom. There was no sixth trophy. There was only a 7-1 defeat. Read it. It remains shocking. Brazil will never want to look at it again. 2. Brazil was finally found out As stunning as this event was, the elements were not that surprising. The signs were there. As their campaign went on, it did not seem as if they were building up to anything special. Instead, it felt like they were just about keeping it together, that they were set to crumble. In virtually all of their games, they came perilously close to the edge. Chile were inches away from knocking them out, while a frantic physicality was needed to eliminate Colombia. The very fact it came to that in the quarterfinal, however, revealed so much about this team. They never had the quality to win this World Cup. By the end, too, the loss of their single world-class attacker in Neymar felt irrelevant. He couldn't have prevented this. There was always the danger of it happening, that they would unravel against a better side. Yet it's still difficult not to think the hysterical reaction fed into the historic nature of this humiliation. The frenzy the entire country worked itself into saw the equal but opposite reaction on this pitch. Once the deeper problems were exposed, it all gave way. Brazil are not this bad. They are not 7-1 bad. This was about something else. This semifinal as an event was certainly something else. 3. Germany's champion credentials Then there was Germany. What a statement. The story is all about Brazil's collapse, but they were the driving force -- in so many ways. It was not just about the implosion of the hosts. Germany imposed that upon them. Sure, Brazil's awful defensive problems were the direct cause of that tone-setting first goal, as Thomas Muller plundered the ball into the net from close in. Thereafter, though, the Germans brutally expanded the gap between the sides. You only had to look at the interchange for the fourth goal, the emphatic finishes of the third and seventh, as Toni Kroos hammered in one and Andre Schurrle powered in the next. Before all that, there was Miroslav Klose's second. What a situation in which to break a legendary Brazilian's record. Ronaldo was forced to congratulate the forward for his 16th goal on national television, adding insult to injury. The only question is whether such a ridiculously handsome win is actually healthy for Germany, whether they could have benefited from a bigger challenge, whether this will blunt them. After a semifinal against the most successful nation in World Cup history, that seems an astonishing thing to say. This was just an astonishing event.

Brazil 1-7 Germany - World Cup hosts utterly humiliated in semfinal - ESPN FC	Brazil's dreams of making a return to a World Cup final in the Maracana were shattered in the most agonising manner as Germany inflicted on the hosts one of the most remarkable defeats in the 84-year history of this competition. Tears flowed like water in the Estadio Mineirao in Belo Horizonte as before even half-an-hour had gone, Brazil were 5-0 down, and the final scoreline was 7-1, equalling their worst-ever defeat, 6-0 to Uruguay back in 1920 before the World Cup had even begun. Brazil 1-7 Germany -- reaction - Marcotti: Scolari at a loss to explain - Jones: Seven stages of grief for Brazil - Duarte: Haunting defeat for the Selecao - Delaney: Three Points - Brazil broken by Germany - Low: German plan worked perfectly - Behind the Numbers: Germany's historic win - Photo Gallery: Best of Brazil vs. Germany - Klose breaks World Cup goals record | Highlight - Social reaction: Brazil, did that just happen? Two goals for Toni Kroos and Andre Schurrle , plus one each for Thomas Muller, Sami Khedira, and record-breaking 16th World Cup goal for Miroslav Klose saw the visitors delirious, while Brazil begins a period of soul-searching such as never before. Germany will go into Sunday's World Cup final at the Maracana to face Argentina or Holland on the highest of highs. The pain was so intense for Brazil, who had arrived at the Estadio Mineirao intent on honouring their missing talisman, Neymar. They tried to use his absence as an inspiration, parading slowly onto the field linked in crocodile formation, with stand-in captain David Luiz and goalkeeper Julio Cesar clutching Neymar's shirt as they belted out the national anthem. The opening period was always going to be a testing one for Germany, with the partisan crowd baying every Brazilian touch and tackle. Marcelo was cheered wildly after sending a 25-yard shot skimming a couple of yards wide, but there was a frantic feel to it, as though the Neymar emotion had spilled over into a frenzy, with Germany capable of punishing any slackness. That almost happened early on when Mesut Ozil delivered a sweet cross for Khedira to volley only for his shot to strike Kroos. A break by Khedira then led to the corner from which Germany took the lead in the 11th minute. Kroos took it, and it was straightforward enough but Brazil's marking went into meltdown and Muller slotted it home low past Julio Cesar while David Luiz beat the ground in frustration. Marcelo burst into the Germany penalty area and a pinpoint sliding tackle by Philipp Lahm stopped him in full stride but Brazil's high tempo only served to make them vulnerable on the break and Germany made them pay again, this time Klose becoming a World Cup's record-breaker. A delightful passing move saw Muller lay the ball off and although Julio Cesar stopped his first effort, Klose buried the rebound. Two minutes later and it was 3-0, Lahm's cross going all the way across the area for Kroos to slam home left-footed from 18 yards. Brazil's historic semifinal loss • Miroslav Klose now highest scorer in World Cup history with 16 goals. • Klose surpassed Brazilian striking legend Ronaldo to claim the record. • Germany scored five goals in 29 minutes, the fastest any team has ever done so in the World Cup. • Brazil had not conceded five goals in an entire World Cup since 1998. • The Selecao conceded 4 in 5 matches in 2010, 2 in 5 in 2006 and 4 in 7 in 2002. • Germany the first team to score five goals in a World Cup 1st half since Poland in 1974. • Brazil had never trailed by 4 goals in any World Cup match before today. (102 previous matches) • Germany now the all-time top scoring team in World Cup history with 221 goals. • Brazil the first host nation to lose a World Cup game by more than three goals.  Another two minutes, another goal. From a goal-kick Fernandinho was robbed by Khedira who unselfishly played in Kroos for a virtual tap-in for 4-0. By this time Brazil fans were in tears and a few leaving their seats, but the German machine marched on mercilessly. Less than half an hour gone and the hosts were 5-0 down. Mats Hummels strode forward and Ozil, who had come alive in this match, set up Khedira for a first-time finish. All over the pitch, in the stands, the executive box where FIFA president Sepp Blatter watched, in the Fan Fests on the beaches and those tens of millions tormented on TVs throughout Brazil, there was sheer disbelief. Scolari's half-time team talk must have been all about rescuing some pride, because it was a different Brazil who came out for the second half, with Paulinho on for the Fernandinho and Ramires for Hulk, with Low sending on Per Mertesacker for Hummels. Neuer had been barely tested in the first half but only he prevented Brazil getting on the scoresheet, first defying Oscar and then Paulinho. Julio Cesar had to be at his best to tip over Muller's curling effort from 25 yards, but Germany were not to be denied and Lahm's penetrating cross was struck home by substitute Schurrle. It was Chelsea midfielder Schurrle who piled on the agony, a breathtaking finish into the top corner after pulling down Muller's instinctive cross. Ozil should have made it an embarrassing eight but slid wide when through on goal before Oscar's crisp finish in the last minute provided a glimmer of light in the darkness. If Brazil wanted to erase the memories of that 1950 final defeat in the Maracana they have done so: this pain would have been infinitely more excruciating.	sports

Luiz Felipe Scolari takes responsibility for Brazil's defeat to Germany - ESPN FC	After Brazil suffered their "worst loss" in their most important home game in 64 years, all coach Luiz Felipe Scolari could do was take the blame for his team's 7-1 thrashing at the hands of Germany. "The catastrophic result can be shared with the whole group, but the choice and who decided the tactical lineup -- I did. The person who is responsible is me," Scolari said. Brazil 1-7 Germany -- reaction - Marcotti: Scolari at a loss to explain - Jones: Seven stages of grief for Brazil - Duarte: Haunting defeat for the Selecao - Delaney: Three Points - Brazil broken by Germany - Low: German plan worked perfectly - Behind the Numbers: Germany's historic win - Photo Gallery: Best of Brazil vs. Germany - Klose breaks World Cup goals record | Highlight - Social reaction: Brazil, did that just happen? Brazil were undone when Germany scored five goals within 30 minutes in the first half, including four goals in a seven-minute span. "My message is for the Brazilian people that we tried to do what we could do," Scolari said. "We did what we think was our best and we lost to a great team who in six or seven minutes, ended the game in an extraordinary manner. "I'm sorry that we were not able to get to the final and we will continue to honour what our team is and fight for third place." Brazil appeared helpless during Germany's onslaught, with Scolari saying "I think everyone blanked out." "We tried to organise, but there was nothing we could do at that moment," the coach said. Brazil were lacking injured star forward Neymar, but Scolari said his presence would not have made a difference. "There's no regret, but it didn't work out in 10 minutes of the match today. The German team was fantastic," he said. "They probably could have done it with Neymar on the field as well. "Let's not try to find an excuse. What happened is that Germany had a fantastic rhythm and defined the match. Germany made use of those moments and Neymar has nothing to do with that. He would not have made a difference to defend all of the goals. Germany would have done this regardless." Brazil were also missing centre-back Thiago Silva, who was suspended after earning his second yellow card, leaving David Luiz to manage the back with Dante, who was making his debut at the tournament. Luiz was left in tears after the match as he walked off the pitch. "I am sorry we couldn't give the fans happiness," he said. "We didn't get it and I ask all of Brazil to forgive me. I only wanted to see all of Brazil smile. This was the most important match of my life." David Luiz and Brazil's defence were shredded without Thiago Silva on the pitch. Right-back Dani Alves was at a loss for solutions to Brazil's first-half problems. "This has been like a nightmare you have about football," he said. "Never in football match has this ever happened to me. Theirs is a team very well put together, very complete in all zones. We lost the match in six minutes. In all of my 31 years I have never seen six minutes that cannot be explained as ours were." Scolari said he tried to rally his players after the early setback, just as he will have to rally them to compete in the third-place match against the loser of Argentina and the Netherlands on Saturday. "I did my job as I've always done it anywhere. I did what I thought was best," Scolari said. "It was a terrible defeat because of the result, but we tried to make it respectable. We all lost, but don't forget there's a match on Saturday, and we can still be third." Scolari also took solace in the fact that many of his players will return for the 2018 World Cup, while implying Germany's players were nearing the edge of their careers. "This team of Germany played the 2008 Euro and 2010 World Cup. Half of our team will play at the next World Cup," Scolari said. "We will see at least 13, 14, 15 players in 2018. It's our worst loss, but we have to learn how to deal with it." It remains to be seen if Scolari will be retained to guide his players in Russia, though Scolari would not admit any regrets on Tuesday night. "Regret what?" he asked. "I don't have any regrets for the choices I made, but I have to put up with the consequences."	sports
Marcotti: A shocking exit for Scolari and Brazil - ESPN FC	BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil -- Eventually, you run out of ideas. At 1-0, the yellow-clad population of the Estadio Mineirao groaned. A bloody nose, yes. But stick some cotton in and suck it up. At 2-0, there was incredulity. A young lady in the stands raised her hand, thumb in, digits extended over her open mouth. 3-0 and 4-0 were one and the same. Two stabs from Toni Kroos in the space of 69 seconds, the fastest brace in the history of the World Cup. Like burning yourself on a hot stove and then stubbing your toe when you jump away in pain. Hurt and more hurt. No time in between to react. But afterward, it was defiance. Chants of "Bra-sil! Bra-sil!" Not lame but full-throated, perhaps as a way of venting anger at the players. At 5-0, folks began to make their way to the exits. Twenty-nine minutes had passed. Read it again. TWENTY-NINE. But people had seen enough. It wasn't a majority, obviously, not even a significant plurality, but enough that you would notice. They filed away silently, looking away from the pitch, a yellow goo oozing toward the stairwells. Halftime was predictable: boos and cat-calls rained down mercilessly and echoed in the cavernous Mineirao. If, prior to kickoff, the ground's acoustics had amplified the Brazilians' sound, now -- after five goals -- it was a roar. At 6-0, the wrath seemed focused on one man. Fred, the mustachioed centre-forward who for the past weeks had flailed in carrying the torch passed on by the legendary Selecao strikers of yesteryear, from Ronaldo and Romario all the way back to Pele and Artur Friedenreich. In truth, the insults, expletives and bile vomited in his direction had begun at the start of the second half, perhaps when the realization he was still on the pitch hit. They rose to a crescendo after Andre Schurrle made it six, and Fred laconically made way for Willian. At 7-0, it was simple. They rose as one and offered up an ovation. Schurrle's goal -- his second -- was pretty, but it wasn't Diego Maradona-against-England-in-1986 pretty. Were they applauding him? The Germans? Were they being sarcastic? Was it all of the above? Or was this merely the last possible reaction they could think of, having exhausted all others? By the time Oscar fixed the final score at 7-1, there had been scuffles in the stands (at least five distinct ones -- all among Brazil fans -- visible from the press tribune). There had also been a period of "oles" at every German touch. Fans do this when they're well ahead, either to celebrate their own side's supremacy or to mock their opponent's futility ("See? They finally strung two passes together."). This was different. It was perhaps as unprecedented as a nation with five stars above its crest losing 7-1 at home in a World Cup semifinal. There is no script for this. It's virgin territory for everyone involved. You don't know how to react. Luiz Felipe Scolari, looking as if he had sailed with Charles Marlowe into the heart of darkness (only, instead of finding Kurtz, he found Kroos), insisted afterward that life goes on. It does. It just won't be the same. "We tried to do what we could, and we did what we thought was best," he said. "But in six or seven minutes, they scored three or four goals [four in six minutes actually, but you wouldn't blame the shell-shocked Scolari for getting it wrong], and they did it in an extraordinary manner. It was one after the other. We tried [from the bench] to talk to them, to get them to stop for a second, but we just could not." In a situation such as this, you wonder if it's even worthwhile talking about tactics. Schemes and formations, after all, often mutate after one goal, usually after two and, well, when you're 5-0 down inside the time it takes to watch a rerun of Glee, there really is no such thing anymore. Scolari was devoid of his best player, Neymar, and his captain and defensive stalwart, Thiago Silva, but to his credit, he didn't use the absences as an excuse. "It would have made no difference," he said. "What was Neymar going to do?" Scolari tried to channel emotions and turn a negative into a neutral or maybe even a positive. David Luiz and Julio Cesar held up the missing talisman's No. 10 jersey, and even the mascots ("player escorts," as FIFA like to call them) sang their little lungs out during a raucous rendition of the Brazilian anthem. Scolari had gone for the jugular, with the same 4-2-3-1 formation he's played throughout the tournament, which many thought he'd abandon against the Germans. Little Bernard, all 5-foot-5 of him, the hometown hero, slotted into the wing, with Oscar shifting inside while Fernandinho and the returning Luiz Gustavo were ready to do battle. There were moments in the first few minutes when it looked like the old-style 4-2-4 Vicente Feola might have used in 1958. But that lasted until the first German goal in the 11th minute, when David Luiz somehow lost Thomas Muller in the penalty box and gifted him the easiest of side-foot finishes from a few yards out. Scolari's dream of winning a second World Cup as Brazil coach ended in humiliating fashion. "Everything was organized, everything was calm until the goal was scored," Scolari said. "Then everything became disorganized, everything was panicked." For his part, Joachim Low offered up the same formation that beat France -- with Phillip Lahm tucked in at right-back -- but with one crucial tweak. When he saw Scolari's lineup, he shifted Sami Khedira from his role alongside Bastian Schweinsteiger in front of the back four to one further forward next to Kroos. 4-2-3-1 became 4-1-4-1 or, if you like your lingo, from triangle up to triangle down. Kroos-Khedira became a two-man gang of outlaws plundering the Brazilian passing lanes and scything their way past the feeble yellow barriers. They prompted the next four goals, including the one that allowed Miroslav Klose to become the all-time leading scorer in World Cup history by passing Ronaldo's mark of 15. "They suddenly were not so well organized, they were hitting long balls, and we took advantage," Low said. "We hit them with fast counterattacks, and we knew that it would cause them problems." The game was over at halftime, except for the record books that would record Schurrle's brace and Oscar's strike. (Don't call it a "consolation goal." Don't you dare.) Afterward, David Luiz apologized in a tearful television interview. Oscar was a fountain of tears too, alternately cuddled by Thiago Silva, himself bawling, and Schurrle, his club teammate. Julio Cesar said that, in place of this, he would much rather have lost 1-0 while making the mistake that cost his team the game. That way, there would only be one scapegoat.

Instead, there are many. "I am responsible," Scolari said. "I pick the team, I prepare the team. Though if you ask my players, they will also say they're responsible because we are a team and we share victories and defeats. But for me, when I look at my life as a player, a coach, a teacher ... yes, it is the worst day of my life. I will be remembered as the man who lost 7-1 in Brazil in a World Cup semifinal." Low was as magnanimous as he could be, given the circumstances. After all, eight years ago, as Jurgen Klinsmann's assistant, he too saw his team come up short as host nation in a World Cup semifinal. "I know how Scolari feels," he said. "I remember 2006 and losing to Italy and the disappointment of a nation." He was being kind. As gut-wrenching as 2006 might have been to Germany, giving up a goal in the 119th minute of a match is not the same as giving up five within 30 minutes and losing 7-1, after 39 years of avoiding defeat in competitive matches on home soil. Low knows there isn't much you can take from this game, other than the result. His men found themselves in a freakish situation, they kept their heads, and they executed. If he's concerned about his troops being grounded and not getting carried away, he can take solace in the words of Kroos. "For a minute, we had trouble believing we were really 5-0 up," he said. "I mean, when do you ever win a semifinal 7-1?" "But we have one more game to go," he continued. "Nobody has ever become world champion in the semifinals." Those are the words of a young man who knows what he wants and knows how to get -- and they're just what Low wanted to hear. Germany and Brazil entered a Twilight Zone on Tuesday. One nation emerged to find itself 90 minutes from becoming champion of the world. The other has wounds that won't heal for a long time.

Right-back Dani Alves was at a loss for solutions to Brazil's first-half problems. "This has been like a nightmare you have about football," he said. "Never in football match has this ever happened to me. Theirs is a team very well put together, very complete in all zones. We lost the match in six minutes. In all of my 31 years I have never seen six minutes that cannot be explained as ours were." Scolari said he tried to rally his players after the early setback, just as he will have to rally them to compete in the third-place match against the loser of Argentina and the Netherlands on Saturday. "I did my job as I've always done it anywhere. I did what I thought was best," Scolari said. "It was a terrible defeat because of the result, but we tried to make it respectable. We all lost, but don't forget there's a match on Saturday, and we can still be third." Scolari also took solace in the fact that many of his players will return for the 2018 World Cup, while implying Germany's players were nearing the edge of their careers. "This team of Germany played the 2008 Euro and 2010 World Cup. Half of our team will play at the next World Cup," Scolari said. "We will see at least 13, 14, 15 players in 2018. It's our worst loss, but we have to learn how to deal with it." It remains to be seen if Scolari will be retained to guide his players in Russia, though Scolari would not admit any regrets on Tuesday night. "Regret what?" he asked. "I don't have any regrets for the choices I made, but I have to put up with the consequences."	sports
Germany striker Miroslav Klose sets new World Cup scoring record - ESPN FC	Miroslav Klose netted against Brazil in the semifinals on Tuesday to become the all-time leading World Cup goalscorer with 16. Klose, 36, had already pulled level with Brazilian legend Ronaldo when he scored in the 71st minute of Germany's clash with Ghana and went one better in the semis in Belo Horizonte. The striker -- who became the first player to ever appear in four World Cup semifinals -- put Joachim Low's side into a 2-0 lead with a 23rd-minute strike.  Top World Cup goalscorers 16 - Miroslav Klose (GER) -  23 games 15 - Ronaldo (BRA) - 19 games 14 - Gerd Muller (GER) - 13 games 13 - Just Fontaine (FRA) - 6 games 12 - Pele (BRA) - 14 games 11 - Sandor Kocsis (HUN) - 5 games 11 - Jurgen Klinsmann (GER) - 17 games 10 - Helmut Rahn - (GER) - 10 games 10 - Gabriel Batistuta (ARG) - 12 games 10 - Teofilo Cubillas (PER) - 13 games Klose's 15th goal came in his 20th World Cup appearance against Ghana and, after failing to score against the USA or make an appearance against Algeria in the round of 16, his 16th goal came in his 23rd, and he has scored at four consecutive tournaments -- only the third player to achieve that feat after Brazil legend Pele and West Germany's Uwe Seeler.  "One strike is not enough for me. I need to add more," Klose said before breaking the record. "I've got brutal mind, always prepare for everything. I don't take any offence [when not starting], I know that I can always help the team, in whatever way. I am ready, you already saw that against Ghana." In 2002, Klose scored five goals, all of them headers as an ageing Germany side progressed to the final. He added another five on home soil in 2006, where he also won the Golden Boot, before netting four more in South Africa in 2010.	sports
Sporting humiliations after Germany thrash Brazil 7-1 - ESPN FC	Brazil's World Cup hopes were not just ended but shattered in the most emphatic of styles by Germany on Tuesday night. Four goals in the space of just seven first-half minutes silenced an entire nation and the shell-shocked hosts eventually lost their semifinal 7-1. Here are some other results which have resulted in red faces. ENGLAND'S CRICKETERS England toured the West Indies in 1994 and in the Third Test at the Queen's Park Oval in Trinidad, were set 194 to win after Andy Caddick returned six for 65 to put his side in control. But the tourists were soon left reeling with Alec Stewart their only batsman to score double figures with 18. England were humbled out for 46 and lost by 147 runs. Fast forward to 2013 and another England team were torn apart on foreign soil. After retaining the Ashes at home in the Summer, Alastair Cook's men took an alarming fast track to a 5-0 Ashes whitewash with a 281-run defeat inside three days in the final Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Cook's hapless tourists arguably plumbed new depths in an already embarrassing campaign as they collapsed yet again, in notional pursuit of a world-record 448 to win, to 166 all out. MANCHESTER UNITED 1-6 MANCHESTER CITY Mario Balotelli provided the spark as City stormed Old Trafford to humiliate rivals United 6-1 as the Italy striker struck twice against 10-man United, who saw defender Jonny Evans sent off. Edin Dzeko scored twice and Sergio Aguero and David Silva added to the tally, while United claimed a consolation through Darren Fletcher but they were ran ragged in the dying moments as City struck three times after the 88th minute. City's victory lifted them five points clear of rivals United and shattered a host of statistics. In recording only their second win at Old Trafford since 1974, City inflicted United's first home defeat since April 2010 and ended their run of 19 consecutive home league wins. SEATTLE SEAHAWKS 43-8 DENVER BRONCOS The Seattle Seahawks produced one of the most dominant performances in Super Bowl history as Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos were crushed 43-8. Ahead of the clash, much focus was on Manning -- just voted the NFL's MVP for the fifth time in his career having led the most prolific offence of all time this year. But, after being gifted a safety on the first play for the quickest ever Super Bowl score, the anticipated 'contest' quickly became a blow-out as Seattle controlled proceedings throughout. CHELSEA 6-0 ARSENAL Arsenal embarrassingly capitulated in Arsene Wenger's 1,000th match in charge with a 6-0 loss to Premier League leaders Chelsea after a spectacular implosion and an horrendous mistake by referee Andre Marriner. The Frenchman watched on helplessly after two goals in three first-half minutes from Samuel Eto'o and Andre Schurrle gave Chelsea a handsome lead before Marriner sent off Kieran Gibbs for a handball committed by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Eden Hazard converted a penalty to give the Blues a 3-0 advantage, Oscar added a fourth before the interval, a fifth after 66 minutes and Mohamed Salah sealed the win. MIKE TYSON vs. BUSTER DOUGLAS One part humiliation, one part shock for this. Tyson was the undispusted heavyweight champion of the world when he met 42/1 rank outsider Buster Douglas in Tokyo in 1990. 'Iron Mike' got it all horribly wrong, though, and was knocked out in the 10th round for a result that remains one of boxing's most famous. Tyson would never be at the peak of his powers again and his career became more infamous than famous. RORY McILROY, THE MASTERS Northern Irishman McIlroy played near perfect golf across the first three days in Augusta to lead the field by four shots in pursuit of his first major. His fourth round was the worst recorded by any professional leading after the third round of the Masters. One over after the front nine, he still lead, but he signed for 80 and finished tied for 15th. To his credit, though, he headed back to America two months later to win the US Open.	sports
Germany countered Brazil's passion with calm, Joachim Low says - ESPN FC	Germany's quick counter-attacks worked exactly as planned, coach Joachim Low said after their 7-1 dismantling of Brazil in Tuesday's semifinal. Entering a raucous Estadio Mineirao, Germany silenced the hosts' fans with a five-goal outbreak inside 30 minutes, and Low said it was important his team remained clear-headed. Brazil 1-7 Germany -- reaction - Marcotti: Scolari at a loss to explain - Jones: Seven stages of grief for Brazil - Duarte: Haunting defeat for the Selecao - Delaney: Three Points - Brazil broken by Germany - Low: German plan worked perfectly - Behind the Numbers: Germany's historic win - Photo Gallery: Best of Brazil vs. Germany - Klose breaks World Cup goals record | Highlight - Social reaction: Brazil, did that just happen? "It was important to counter their passion and emotions with calmness, patience and persistence, also with courage and believe in our own strength," Low said on German network ZDF. "Brazil were shocked, they did not expect that." "We scored five goals in 18 minutes. It's clear that they were shocked. "We knew that if we are quick on the counters, and go straight into attack after winning balls they will be disorganised. We played well in the first half. "But it's not over yet. And humbleness will suit us just fine. We might have recorded a huge win, but we must stay focused until Sunday. The players are ready to make that last step." Toni Kroos and Germany hit Brazil hard in the first half and never looked back in a 7-1 semifinal victory. Low likened the feelings the host country must be feeling to Germany's own defeat to Italy in the semifinals of the 2006 World Cup that Die Mannschaft hosted, and offered sympathy to Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari. "I can understand what Scolari is going through," Low said. "It's a bit like in 2006, when Italy beat us in the semifinal. The whole country wants you to make it to the final. I feel sorry for him." Defender Mats Hummels admitted that the team realised at halftime what nearly every fan watching around the world already knew -- Germany had won the game before the break. "It's unbelievable, incredible what happened on the pitch," Hummels said. "I don't think something like that has happened too often. We now want to make the final step. It was quieter in the dressing room than after a tight match. Without sounding arrogant, we knew we were through at halftime." Nearly lost in the shuffle was Miroslav Klose's record-breaking goal. He now stands alone with 16 career goals at the World Cup, taking the record from Brazil's Ronaldo. "I am so happy for Miroslav Klose," Low said. "That he got the record in a match against the host nation, it's an incredible achievement." Toni Kroos, who scored twice in Germany's first-half onslaught, was named man of the match. "It was an impressive match and from the first minute, we had the impression that something was possible," Kroos said. "Brazil were not clear in what they wanted to do and we took advantage of our opportunities. We played an outstanding match. "If somebody had said before that we would win 7-1, I wouldn't have believed it. After the first match, I said we're here to become World Champions. We're not champions yet and will have an extremely difficult step in order to achieve our goal. We were happy in the dressing room, but let's not forget there is still one match ahead of us."	sports

Germany defender Mats Hummels has knee injury, status for World Cup final uncertain - ESPN FC	Germany defender Mats Hummels' status for the World Cup final is uncertain as he deals with a knee injury. Hummels came off at halftime of Germany's 7-1 semifinal victory against Brazil on Tuesday, with Die Mannschaft already comfortably ahead 5-0. The centre-back said the problem was not major, but it may be able to keep him out of Sunday's final, when Germany will face the winners of Argentina and the Netherlands. Hummels hurt his left knee in Germany's opening match against Portugal but returned for the next game. Mats Hummels left Germany's win at halftime with a knee injury that could rule him out of the final. He also sat out their round of 16 match against Algeria with the flu, but then scored the only goal in their quarterfinal win over France. "More problems with my knee," Hummels told German radio ARD. "We will find out the exact diagnosis [on Wednesday]. "There won't be a horror diagnosis and there is hope that it works again in five days. I will definitely need intensive treatment. "If I can't train on Saturday I wouldn't go and say I can play on Sunday." Hummels helped set up Germany's fifth goal on Tuesday with a dashing run through the midfield.	sports

Alejandro Sabella hails Lionel Messi has best player in the world - ESPN FC	SAO PAULO -- Normally a reserved man who avoids hype, Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella isn't shy about declaring Lionel Messi to be the best player in the world. Comparing the Argentina captain with Arjen Robben of the Netherlands and Brazil's Neymar, Sabella on Tuesday held up Messi as the undisputed No. 1. "Robben is a great player. He is very important for Holland. Like Neymar is for Brazil and Messi for Argentina," Sabella said. "Each of them is important for their teams, but Messi is the best of them all." After a disappointing World Cup four years ago, Messi has carried Argentina into the semifinals in Brazil, scoring four goals -- the same tally Neymar reached before injury ruled him out of the tournament. Robben, who faces Argentina in the second semifinal on Wednesday, has scored three. Though he's been named world player of the year for times for his accomplishments with Barcelona, Messi hasn't had the same kind of success with Argentina, who haven't won a major title since the 1993 Copa America. Lionel Messi is more important to Argentina than any other player is to any other team, says Alejandro Sabella. This is the first time since 1990 that Argentina have reached a World Cup semifinal, which Sabella said was a victory in itself. "After 24 years Argentina is among the four best teams in the world," Sabella said. "I think this group of players has already won. Let's see if we can win even more." If they do win the semifinal, Argentina won't have to worry about rivals Brazil in the title game. Sabella was just as stunned as everyone else to see Brazil lose 7-1 to Germany in the first semifinal, a game Argentina's players watched the end of on TV at Itaquerao Stadium, even delaying their training session for around 20 minutes. Sabella said the heavy defeat for Brazil was clearly "not normal." "But in football you have to expect these things," Sabella said. "It's football. It's the most illogical of sports. Things happen that you cannot foresee."	sports

Netherlands vs. Argentina: July 9, 4 ET (ESPN and WatchESPN) - Stats: Diego Maradona vs. Lionel Messi - McIntyre: Superstars collide in Messi vs. Robben - Brewin: Van Gaal's management style - Brassell: Semifinalists have much to lose - Honigstein: Kuyt an unsung hero for the Dutch - Cox: Key semifinal matchups - Marcotti: Then there were four at the World Cup - Five Aside: Dutch, Argentina look to overcome past And Netherlands coach Louis van Gaal confirmed on the eve of the Albiceleste game in Sao Paulo that the striker, who has scored three goals in Brazil, is a serious doubt. "He has a stomach problem, an intestinal problem. I don't know [if he will play],'' Van Gaal told his prematch news conference. "I will decide [on Wednesday]. "Van Persie is our captain, so he is very important to us. In principle my captain always plays, but he has to be fit. "In general, I give the players two days to recover, so if you have one day less it's an issue, a problem. But a top athlete can perform, so my players will be in shape.'' There was better news for midfielder Nigel de Jong, who went through his paces along with the rest of the team in training in a bid to regain his place in Van Gaal's starting XI. De Jong injured his groin early in the second-round victory over Mexico, and there were fears his tournament was over after the Dutch team said he likely would need two to four weeks to recover. But Van Gaal said: "If his reaction is good and he can play, then the miracle can come true." There was further good news for the Netherlands coach on Tuesday, as injury doubts Ron Vlaar and Leroy Fer both trained. Meanwhile, Van Gaal's decision to bring on Tim Krul in the 120th minute of the quarterfinal win against Costa Rica was hailed as a masterstroke. Krul saved two penalties after replacing Jasper Cillessen, but the Newcastle man will not start the semifinal. "No. I ruled that out straight away,'' Van Gaal said when asked whether he would play Krul. "Jasper is doing a wonderful job, it was just that stopping a penalty is something that the others [Krul and third choice Michel Vorm] are better at.'' Although Argentina are yet to hit peak form in Brazil, they are the bookmakers' favourites for the match at the Arena Corinthians. Van Gaal, though, believes there is nothing between the two sides. "I don't think there is a favourite,'' he said. "The countries are at the same level. It's a 50-50 match and we have to be a bit lucky too.'' Key to Netherlands' chances of making the final will be how they deal with the threat posed by Lionel Messi, who has finally transferred his domestic form with Barcelona onto the international stage. "He has been voted the world's best player before, and you don't get that for nothing,'' Van Gaal said. "He has always found it hard to show his form at international level. "He wants to do it at this tournament, and we want to stop him. That will be a challenge.''	sports

Brazil 1-7 Germany - World Cup hosts utterly humiliated in semfinal - ESPN FC	Brazil's dreams of making a return to a World Cup final in the Maracana were shattered in the most agonising manner as Germany inflicted on the hosts one of the most remarkable defeats in the 84-year history of this competition. Tears flowed like water in the Estadio Mineirao in Belo Horizonte as before even half-an-hour had gone, Brazil were 5-0 down, and the final scoreline was 7-1, equalling their worst-ever defeat, 6-0 to Uruguay back in 1920 before the World Cup had even begun. Brazil 1-7 Germany -- reaction - Marcotti: Scolari at a loss to explain - Jones: Seven stages of grief for Brazil - Duarte: Haunting defeat for the Selecao - Delaney: Three Points - Brazil broken by Germany - Low: German plan worked perfectly - Behind the Numbers: Germany's historic win - Photo Gallery: Best of Brazil vs. Germany - Klose breaks World Cup goals record | Highlight - Social reaction: Brazil, did that just happen? Two goals for Toni Kroos and Andre Schurrle , plus one each for Thomas Muller, Sami Khedira, and record-breaking 16th World Cup goal for Miroslav Klose saw the visitors delirious, while Brazil begins a period of soul-searching such as never before. Germany will go into Sunday's World Cup final at the Maracana to face Argentina or Holland on the highest of highs. The pain was so intense for Brazil, who had arrived at the Estadio Mineirao intent on honouring their missing talisman, Neymar. They tried to use his absence as an inspiration, parading slowly onto the field linked in crocodile formation, with stand-in captain David Luiz and goalkeeper Julio Cesar clutching Neymar's shirt as they belted out the national anthem. The opening period was always going to be a testing one for Germany, with the partisan crowd baying every Brazilian touch and tackle. Marcelo was cheered wildly after sending a 25-yard shot skimming a couple of yards wide, but there was a frantic feel to it, as though the Neymar emotion had spilled over into a frenzy, with Germany capable of punishing any slackness. That almost happened early on when Mesut Ozil delivered a sweet cross for Khedira to volley only for his shot to strike Kroos. A break by Khedira then led to the corner from which Germany took the lead in the 11th minute. Kroos took it, and it was straightforward enough but Brazil's marking went into meltdown and Muller slotted it home low past Julio Cesar while David Luiz beat the ground in frustration. Marcelo burst into the Germany penalty area and a pinpoint sliding tackle by Philipp Lahm stopped him in full stride but Brazil's high tempo only served to make them vulnerable on the break and Germany made them pay again, this time Klose becoming a World Cup's record-breaker. A delightful passing move saw Muller lay the ball off and although Julio Cesar stopped his first effort, Klose buried the rebound. Two minutes later and it was 3-0, Lahm's cross going all the way across the area for Kroos to slam home left-footed from 18 yards. Brazil's historic semifinal loss • Miroslav Klose now highest scorer in World Cup history with 16 goals. • Klose surpassed Brazilian striking legend Ronaldo to claim the record. • Germany scored five goals in 29 minutes, the fastest any team has ever done so in the World Cup. • Brazil had not conceded five goals in an entire World Cup since 1998. • The Selecao conceded 4 in 5 matches in 2010, 2 in 5 in 2006 and 4 in 7 in 2002. • Germany the first team to score five goals in a World Cup 1st half since Poland in 1974. • Brazil had never trailed by 4 goals in any World Cup match before today. (102 previous matches) • Germany now the all-time top scoring team in World Cup history with 221 goals. • Brazil the first host nation to lose a World Cup game by more than three goals.  Another two minutes, another goal. From a goal-kick Fernandinho was robbed by Khedira who unselfishly played in Kroos for a virtual tap-in for 4-0. By this time Brazil fans were in tears and a few leaving their seats, but the German machine marched on mercilessly. Less than half an hour gone and the hosts were 5-0 down. Mats Hummels strode forward and Ozil, who had come alive in this match, set up Khedira for a first-time finish. All over the pitch, in the stands, the executive box where FIFA president Sepp Blatter watched, in the Fan Fests on the beaches and those tens of millions tormented on TVs throughout Brazil, there was sheer disbelief. Scolari's half-time team talk must have been all about rescuing some pride, because it was a different Brazil who came out for the second half, with Paulinho on for the Fernandinho and Ramires for Hulk, with Low sending on Per Mertesacker for Hummels. Neuer had been barely tested in the first half but only he prevented Brazil getting on the scoresheet, first defying Oscar and then Paulinho. Julio Cesar had to be at his best to tip over Muller's curling effort from 25 yards, but Germany were not to be denied and Lahm's penetrating cross was struck home by substitute Schurrle. It was Chelsea midfielder Schurrle who piled on the agony, a breathtaking finish into the top corner after pulling down Muller's instinctive cross. Ozil should have made it an embarrassing eight but slid wide when through on goal before Oscar's crisp finish in the last minute provided a glimmer of light in the darkness. If Brazil wanted to erase the memories of that 1950 final defeat in the Maracana they have done so: this pain would have been infinitely more excruciating.	sports

Alejandro Sabella hails Lionel Messi has best player in the world - ESPN FC	SAO PAULO -- Normally a reserved man who avoids hype, Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella isn't shy about declaring Lionel Messi to be the best player in the world. Comparing the Argentina captain with Arjen Robben of the Netherlands and Brazil's Neymar, Sabella on Tuesday held up Messi as the undisputed No. 1. "Robben is a great player. He is very important for Holland. Like Neymar is for Brazil and Messi for Argentina," Sabella said. "Each of them is important for their teams, but Messi is the best of them all." After a disappointing World Cup four years ago, Messi has carried Argentina into the semifinals in Brazil, scoring four goals -- the same tally Neymar reached before injury ruled him out of the tournament. Robben, who faces Argentina in the second semifinal on Wednesday, has scored three. Though he's been named world player of the year for times for his accomplishments with Barcelona, Messi hasn't had the same kind of success with Argentina, who haven't won a major title since the 1993 Copa America. Lionel Messi is more important to Argentina than any other player is to any other team, says Alejandro Sabella. This is the first time since 1990 that Argentina have reached a World Cup semifinal, which Sabella said was a victory in itself. "After 24 years Argentina is among the four best teams in the world," Sabella said. "I think this group of players has already won. Let's see if we can win even more." If they do win the semifinal, Argentina won't have to worry about rivals Brazil in the title game. Sabella was just as stunned as everyone else to see Brazil lose 7-1 to Germany in the first semifinal, a game Argentina's players watched the end of on TV at Itaquerao Stadium, even delaying their training session for around 20 minutes. Sabella said the heavy defeat for Brazil was clearly "not normal." "But in football you have to expect these things," Sabella said. "It's football. It's the most illogical of sports. Things happen that you cannot foresee."	sports

Lazar Markovic set for Liverpool medical - ESPN FC	Lazar Markovic is set to have a medical later this week as Liverpool close in on their fourth summer signing. The Reds should secure the 20 million pound deal for the Benfica winger within the next few days, sources have told ESPN FC. Markovic is due on Merseyside to put the finishing touches to the transfer as manager Brendan Rodgers continues to add to his squad with the departure of Luis Suarez pending. The 20-year-old, who moved to Portugal from Partizan Belgrade in June 2013, helped Benfica to last season's Europa League final -- although he missed the defeat against Sevilla in Turin because of suspension. Lazar Markovic scored five goals in 25 games for Benfica last season. Rodgers has brought in three players so far this summer -- England internationals Rickie Lambert and Adam Lallana from Southampton and Germany Under-21 midfielder Emre Can from Bayer Leverkusen -- and is looking to strengthen further. A deal worth an initial fee of six million pounds for Lille's Belgian midfielder Divock Origi is in the pipeline. And Liverpool are also still pursuing moves for Sevilla left-back Alberto Moreno and Southampton centre-back Dejan Lovren, although they are not close to agreeing a fee for either player. Talks over the proposed 75 million pound sale of Uruguay striker Suarez to Barcelona are continuing, with the sticking point believed to be the structuring of payments rather than the fee itself. Rodgers is also looking to sell goalkeeper Pepe Reina -- who spent last season on loan in Serie A at Napoli -- but has had no offers so far.	sports

Scolari, it should be noted, put on the pitch a first XI that had never trained together.

The defeat was particularly hard on the goalkeeper, not only because of the number of balls in the back of his net but also due to the feeling that his teammates have a lot of work to do to shake off this Mineirazo. "I wish we had lost 1-0, and I had made mistake," he said. "It's very hard what happened today. They simply scored four goals in six minutes, and all of a sudden we were all over the place. We lost our focus, and that was fatal against a team like Germany. These guys have been playing together for six years and contested a series of European Championships and World Cup semifinals.

"I am gutted, it was impossible not to feel like crying after a game like this," the scorer of Brazil's goal said. In an attempt to pick up the pieces, David Luiz, whose first official game as Brazil captain ended with the horrendous sound of home fans booing the Selecao after applauding the Germans' seventh goal, called for calm. "Life is not over," he said. "It's perhaps the hardest moments in our lives, but we need to be mature and own up to our mistakes. We have a chance to leave this World Cup with our heads up". It will be much easier said than done. The drubbing in Belo Horizonte has, ironically, finally turned the Maracanazo, Brazil's famous defeat to Uruguay in the final match of the 1950 World Cup, into a thing of the ancient past.

A haunting defeat for Brazil - ESPN FC	BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil -- You have got to hand it to the Brazilian players. A few minutes after suffering the worst drubbing in the history of their national team, they did not resort to evasive tactics when it was time to explain what had just happened on the Estadio Mineirao pitch. The problem was none of them seemed to know the answer to the question. One by one, they negotiated the maze called the mixed zone with looks that gave away a feeling many people watching the semifinal against Germany had been able to preempt: This generation of Selecao stars will be forever marked by Tuesday's events in Belo Horizonte. Dani Alves, dropped from the team after the Chile game in the round of 16, led the saddest of parades. "We have lost the game, and that hurts more than anything else," the Barcelona full-back said. "We are out of the final, and that would have been difficult to handle even if we had lost 1-0." There was nowhere to hide from a score that kept flashing on the many monitors spread around the maze.

Lazar Markovic set for Liverpool medical - ESPN FC	Lazar Markovic is set to have a medical later this week as Liverpool close in on their fourth summer signing. The Reds should secure the 20 million pound deal for the Benfica winger within the next few days, sources have told ESPN FC. Markovic is due on Merseyside to put the finishing touches to the transfer as manager Brendan Rodgers continues to add to his squad with the departure of Luis Suarez pending. The 20-year-old, who moved to Portugal from Partizan Belgrade in June 2013, helped Benfica to last season's Europa League final -- although he missed the defeat against Sevilla in Turin because of suspension. Lazar Markovic scored five goals in 25 games for Benfica last season. Rodgers has brought in three players so far this summer -- England internationals Rickie Lambert and Adam Lallana from Southampton and Germany Under-21 midfielder Emre Can from Bayer Leverkusen -- and is looking to strengthen further. A deal worth an initial fee of six million pounds for Lille's Belgian midfielder Divock Origi is in the pipeline. And Liverpool are also still pursuing moves for Sevilla left-back Alberto Moreno and Southampton centre-back Dejan Lovren, although they are not close to agreeing a fee for either player. Talks over the proposed 75 million pound sale of Uruguay striker Suarez to Barcelona are continuing, with the sticking point believed to be the structuring of payments rather than the fee itself. Rodgers is also looking to sell goalkeeper Pepe Reina -- who spent last season on loan in Serie A at Napoli -- but has had no offers so far.	sports
Three points - History made as Brazil broken by rampant Germany - ESPN FC	BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil -- Three thoughts on a record-breaking night as Brazil were humiliated by a rampant Germany side on the march towards the World Cup final.  1. An eternal embarrassment After so many goals, there was only one description: Minerazo. This was not as painfully dramatic as the 1950 loss to Uruguay -- forever remembered as the Maracanazo -- but that was only because it was possibly worse: It was so humiliatingly excruciating. The details of Germany's 7-1 win -- and the sheer numbers alone are searing -- remain difficult to register. It revealed so much that the first boos were not heard until the 44th minute, long after the fifth goal had been scored. It was as if that was how long it took for the utter shock to wear off, to realise just how bad this was. The dimensions to this defeat were as plentiful as Germany's goals. Given the history, the context, the politics, this may well be the most stunning World Cup match of all time. It is extremely difficult to think of a result or event that compares in football history as a whole. After a World Cup that Brazil had waited two generations for, they have now suffered a defeat that will take generations to forget. The circumstances are almost cruel. The scale of the defeat certainly was. The competition Brazil have dominated and won more than any other country has also left them with their two most painful defeats. They are of the type of defeats that very few victories can erode, that almost nothing can rectify. Brazil now has so much to consider. On their team bus for the World Cup, the message read: "Brace Yourself -- The Sixth is Coming." That took on dark tones. The game itself took on a scarcely believable gloom. There was no sixth trophy. There was only a 7-1 defeat. Read it. It remains shocking. Brazil will never want to look at it again. 2. Brazil was finally found out As stunning as this event was, the elements were not that surprising. The signs were there. As their campaign went on, it did not seem as if they were building up to anything special. Instead, it felt like they were just about keeping it together, that they were set to crumble. In virtually all of their games, they came perilously close to the edge. Chile were inches away from knocking them out, while a frantic physicality was needed to eliminate Colombia. The very fact it came to that in the quarterfinal, however, revealed so much about this team. They never had the quality to win this World Cup. By the end, too, the loss of their single world-class attacker in Neymar felt irrelevant. He couldn't have prevented this. There was always the danger of it happening, that they would unravel against a better side. Yet it's still difficult not to think the hysterical reaction fed into the historic nature of this humiliation. The frenzy the entire country worked itself into saw the equal but opposite reaction on this pitch. Once the deeper problems were exposed, it all gave way. Brazil are not this bad. They are not 7-1 bad. This was about something else. This semifinal as an event was certainly something else. 3. Germany's champion credentials Then there was Germany. What a statement. The story is all about Brazil's collapse, but they were the driving force -- in so many ways. It was not just about the implosion of the hosts. Germany imposed that upon them. Sure, Brazil's awful defensive problems were the direct cause of that tone-setting first goal, as Thomas Muller plundered the ball into the net from close in. Thereafter, though, the Germans brutally expanded the gap between the sides. You only had to look at the interchange for the fourth goal, the emphatic finishes of the third and seventh, as Toni Kroos hammered in one and Andre Schurrle powered in the next. Before all that, there was Miroslav Klose's second. What a situation in which to break a legendary Brazilian's record. Ronaldo was forced to congratulate the forward for his 16th goal on national television, adding insult to injury. The only question is whether such a ridiculously handsome win is actually healthy for Germany, whether they could have benefited from a bigger challenge, whether this will blunt them. After a semifinal against the most successful nation in World Cup history, that seems an astonishing thing to say. This was just an astonishing event.

Brazil's 7 stages of grief against Germany in the World Cup - ESPN FC	SAO PAULO -- The fireworks, blasts like cannons, were going off hours before the game. Not very many went off after. Anticipation had given way to humiliation, and by now this giant city seems to have accepted it. Brazil's historic defeat by the Germans might have been just bad enough to save us. There have been fears, spoken of surprisingly often and openly, about what terrible things would happen if Brazil failed to win this World Cup -- something seen by some here almost as a divine right, a function of pure destiny. Mostly, people had talked about how sideways the world might go if the hosts lost to the hated Argentines in the final. Then every clamp and governor that had been thrown onto this crackling country -- most of the pre-tournament anger having subsided once the games began -- would be released. In the absence of any reason for unity, a potentially violent division would return. It turns out a more decisive cataclysm was coming. Tens of thousands, fenced in by police and metal barricades, packed into the FIFA Fan Fest in Sao Paulo's downtown core before Tuesday night's game. There were concerts and banners and sloshing cups of beer, the familiar motions of celebration, but in truth it was already a kind of limited buoyancy. With Neymar's injury and Thiago Silva's suspension, local hopes had been muted. But they were still there, if under the surface. The anthem wasn't sung so much as it was shouted, and then the whistle blew. Brazil 1-7 Germany -- reaction - Marcotti: Scolari at a loss to explain - Jones: Seven stages of grief for Brazil - Duarte: Haunting defeat for the Selecao - Delaney: Three Points - Brazil broken by Germany - Low: German plan worked perfectly - Behind the Numbers: Germany's historic win - Photo Gallery: Best of Brazil vs. Germany - Klose breaks World Cup goals record | Highlight - Social reaction: Brazil, did that just happen? Then the Germans did what they did -- and so quickly -- with each of their seven goals serving as another of the makeshift stages of accelerated Brazilian grief. The first was met with anxiety, the second with anger, the third with disappointment, the fourth with disbelief. Then came bemusement, surprisingly enough -- some percentage of the thinning crowd that remained actually began cheering for the Germans -- and then understanding and finally acceptance. If there were still a bomb set to go off, the late Brazilian goal, that slim measure of pride, cut the last wire. By then, though, there was no longer any sense of real danger here, no feeling that riots were about to kick off. There were too many police, for starters, but more importantly, there wasn't really anything for the crowd to be angry about. This was a brutal defeat, but it contained no injustice or heartbreak. Brazil -- this Brazil -- just weren't good enough to win the World Cup, even given the advantages of home. They had barely beaten Chile, and they had struggled to hold on against the Colombians. Brazilians had remained hopeful their boys would continue to win, but it felt more and more as though they had stopped believing they would. After they had been made doubtless, they left and went home, or they stumbled into bars in search of one last commiserating drink. Some even thought to blow their air horns, almost ironic screams of defiance against the dark. Maybe the coming days will turn ugly, and fears will come true. Maybe this country will feel the way any of us does when houseguests linger too long. Maybe, for the first time in its history, Brazil will want the party to be over. But right now it doesn't feel that way. It doesn't feel like much of anything. Right now Sao Paulo feels like any other city in the world, except bigger, lit up, buzzing and perhaps even relieved to have joined the World Cup's ever expanding ranks of the abruptly detached.	sports

Sure, Brazil's awful defensive problems were the direct cause of that tone-setting first goal, as Thomas Muller plundered the ball into the net from close in. Thereafter, though, the Germans brutally expanded the gap between the sides. You only had to look at the interchange for the fourth goal, the emphatic finishes of the third and seventh, as Toni Kroos hammered in one and Andre Schurrle powered in the next. Before all that, there was Miroslav Klose's second. What a situation in which to break a legendary Brazilian's record. Ronaldo was forced to congratulate the forward for his 16th goal on national television, adding insult to injury. The only question is whether such a ridiculously handsome win is actually healthy for Germany, whether they could have benefited from a bigger challenge, whether this will blunt them. After a semifinal against the most successful nation in World Cup history, that seems an astonishing thing to say. This was just an astonishing event.

Brazil's 7 stages of grief against Germany in the World Cup - ESPN FC	SAO PAULO -- The fireworks, blasts like cannons, were going off hours before the game. Not very many went off after. Anticipation had given way to humiliation, and by now this giant city seems to have accepted it. Brazil's historic defeat by the Germans might have been just bad enough to save us. There have been fears, spoken of surprisingly often and openly, about what terrible things would happen if Brazil failed to win this World Cup -- something seen by some here almost as a divine right, a function of pure destiny. Mostly, people had talked about how sideways the world might go if the hosts lost to the hated Argentines in the final. Then every clamp and governor that had been thrown onto this crackling country -- most of the pre-tournament anger having subsided once the games began -- would be released. In the absence of any reason for unity, a potentially violent division would return. It turns out a more decisive cataclysm was coming. Tens of thousands, fenced in by police and metal barricades, packed into the FIFA Fan Fest in Sao Paulo's downtown core before Tuesday night's game. There were concerts and banners and sloshing cups of beer, the familiar motions of celebration, but in truth it was already a kind of limited buoyancy. With Neymar's injury and Thiago Silva's suspension, local hopes had been muted. But they were still there, if under the surface. The anthem wasn't sung so much as it was shouted, and then the whistle blew. Brazil 1-7 Germany -- reaction - Marcotti: Scolari at a loss to explain - Jones: Seven stages of grief for Brazil - Duarte: Haunting defeat for the Selecao - Delaney: Three Points - Brazil broken by Germany - Low: German plan worked perfectly - Behind the Numbers: Germany's historic win - Photo Gallery: Best of Brazil vs. Germany - Klose breaks World Cup goals record | Highlight - Social reaction: Brazil, did that just happen? Then the Germans did what they did -- and so quickly -- with each of their seven goals serving as another of the makeshift stages of accelerated Brazilian grief. The first was met with anxiety, the second with anger, the third with disappointment, the fourth with disbelief. Then came bemusement, surprisingly enough -- some percentage of the thinning crowd that remained actually began cheering for the Germans -- and then understanding and finally acceptance. If there were still a bomb set to go off, the late Brazilian goal, that slim measure of pride, cut the last wire. By then, though, there was no longer any sense of real danger here, no feeling that riots were about to kick off. There were too many police, for starters, but more importantly, there wasn't really anything for the crowd to be angry about. This was a brutal defeat, but it contained no injustice or heartbreak. Brazil -- this Brazil -- just weren't good enough to win the World Cup, even given the advantages of home. They had barely beaten Chile, and they had struggled to hold on against the Colombians. Brazilians had remained hopeful their boys would continue to win, but it felt more and more as though they had stopped believing they would. After they had been made doubtless, they left and went home, or they stumbled into bars in search of one last commiserating drink. Some even thought to blow their air horns, almost ironic screams of defiance against the dark. Maybe the coming days will turn ugly, and fears will come true. Maybe this country will feel the way any of us does when houseguests linger too long. Maybe, for the first time in its history, Brazil will want the party to be over. But right now it doesn't feel that way. It doesn't feel like much of anything. Right now Sao Paulo feels like any other city in the world, except bigger, lit up, buzzing and perhaps even relieved to have joined the World Cup's ever expanding ranks of the abruptly detached.	sports

A haunting defeat for Brazil - ESPN FC	BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil -- You have got to hand it to the Brazilian players. A few minutes after suffering the worst drubbing in the history of their national team, they did not resort to evasive tactics when it was time to explain what had just happened on the Estadio Mineirao pitch. The problem was none of them seemed to know the answer to the question. One by one, they negotiated the maze called the mixed zone with looks that gave away a feeling many people watching the semifinal against Germany had been able to preempt: This generation of Selecao stars will be forever marked by Tuesday's events in Belo Horizonte. Dani Alves, dropped from the team after the Chile game in the round of 16, led the saddest of parades. "We have lost the game, and that hurts more than anything else," the Barcelona full-back said. "We are out of the final, and that would have been difficult to handle even if we had lost 1-0." There was nowhere to hide from a score that kept flashing on the many monitors spread around the maze. Brazil 1-7 Germany -- reaction - Marcotti: Scolari at a loss to explain - Jones: Seven stages of grief for Brazil - Duarte: Haunting defeat for the Selecao - Delaney: Three Points - Brazil broken by Germany - Low: German plan worked perfectly - Behind the Numbers: Germany's historic win - Photo Gallery: Best of Brazil vs. Germany - Klose breaks World Cup goals record | Highlight - Social reaction: Brazil, did that just happen? Seven goals to one. It is a result that will mark a generation of footballers, supporters and -- why not -- journalists. The fact that Brazil still have a chance to save some face in Saturday's playoff for third place in Brasilia seemed much less a consolation prize than a nuisance for athletes who had just been humiliated on the biggest stage of their careers, in front of their own fans. "We have to take it like men and try to bounce back," Willian said, with his gaze focusing on everything other than his interlocutor's eyes. "We are all family bread-winners and people with feelings. We know this defeat might haunt us for the rest of our lives." Still, Brazil will have to take the field once more, and avoiding another debacle has become a matter of urgency for Luiz Felipe Scolari, who could not have looked more deflated. Gone was his dream of emulating Italy's Vittorio Pozzo as the only manager to win two World Cups, and in the same stride, he might have kissed goodbye to aspirations of a triumphant return to European football to resume a project abruptly aborted when he was dismissed by Chelsea in 2009. As expected, Big Phil attempted to shoulder the blame. "Who is responsible for team selection and tactical choices? I am," he said. "So I am the person who will be remembered for the worst defeat, but we took a risk, and now we have to assimilate and keep living." Scolari, it should be noted, put on the pitch a first XI that had never trained together. Even victory in Saturday's third-place match will do little to shake the memories of Brazil's Belo Horizonte humiliation. Saturday's game will actually be the start of the Selecao's long walk of shame toward the 2018 World Cup. For a start, it will probably be the last time we will see a good number of players in a Brazil shirt. Julio Cesar, who turns 35 in September, all but ruled himself out of future caps -- "maybe the next World Cup is beyond my reach" -- when trying to talk about the future of the team. The defeat was particularly hard on the goalkeeper, not only because of the number of balls in the back of his net but also due to the feeling that his teammates have a lot of work to do to shake off this Mineirazo. "I wish we had lost 1-0, and I had made mistake," he said. "It's very hard what happened today. They simply scored four goals in six minutes, and all of a sudden we were all over the place. We lost our focus, and that was fatal against a team like Germany. These guys have been playing together for six years and contested a series of European Championships and World Cup semifinals. They are experienced and pounced on our mistakes." Oscar, who was propped up by Scolari on the pitch and seemingly admonished by the manager for weeping, was the image of somebody dreading to think about the next few months or years. "I am gutted, it was impossible not to feel like crying after a game like this," the scorer of Brazil's goal said. In an attempt to pick up the pieces, David Luiz, whose first official game as Brazil captain ended with the horrendous sound of home fans booing the Selecao after applauding the Germans' seventh goal, called for calm. "Life is not over," he said. "It's perhaps the hardest moments in our lives, but we need to be mature and own up to our mistakes. We have a chance to leave this World Cup with our heads up". It will be much easier said than done. The drubbing in Belo Horizonte has, ironically, finally turned the Maracanazo, Brazil's famous defeat to Uruguay in the final match of the 1950 World Cup, into a thing of the ancient past. Haunting the Selecao now -- and for the foreseeable future -- is a night in which they were humbled, outclassed and made to look ordinary. It is impossible not to think they are main witnesses to the moment Brazilian football as we know it died a horrible and painful death at the hands of Germany. Bouncing back from that will take a lot more than words and promises.

Lazar Markovic set for Liverpool medical - ESPN FC	Lazar Markovic is set to have a medical later this week as Liverpool close in on their fourth summer signing. The Reds should secure the 20 million pound deal for the Benfica winger within the next few days, sources have told ESPN FC. Markovic is due on Merseyside to put the finishing touches to the transfer as manager Brendan Rodgers continues to add to his squad with the departure of Luis Suarez pending. The 20-year-old, who moved to Portugal from Partizan Belgrade in June 2013, helped Benfica to last season's Europa League final -- although he missed the defeat against Sevilla in Turin because of suspension. Lazar Markovic scored five goals in 25 games for Benfica last season. Rodgers has brought in three players so far this summer -- England internationals Rickie Lambert and Adam Lallana from Southampton and Germany Under-21 midfielder Emre Can from Bayer Leverkusen -- and is looking to strengthen further. A deal worth an initial fee of six million pounds for Lille's Belgian midfielder Divock Origi is in the pipeline. And Liverpool are also still pursuing moves for Sevilla left-back Alberto Moreno and Southampton centre-back Dejan Lovren, although they are not close to agreeing a fee for either player. Talks over the proposed 75 million pound sale of Uruguay striker Suarez to Barcelona are continuing, with the sticking point believed to be the structuring of payments rather than the fee itself. Rodgers is also looking to sell goalkeeper Pepe Reina -- who spent last season on loan in Serie A at Napoli -- but has had no offers so far.	sports

Germany's lopsided win makes statistical history - ESPN FC	Germany's remarkable opening half-hour gave them a 5-0 lead against Brazil and made history in a number of ways -- as did Brazil's defeat. A look at the top facts from Tuesday's 7-1 semifinal: High-flying Germany • By scoring Germany's second goal, Miroslav Klose became the most prolific goal scorer in World Cup history. Klose now has 16 World Cup goals in his career, breaking a tie with Brazil's Ronaldo. • Germany scored five goals in the first 29 minutes, the fastest any team has scored five goals in any game in World Cup history. Yugoslavia scored five in 30 minutes against Zaire in 1974. • Germany are the first team to score five goals in the first half of any World Cup game since Poland against Haiti in 1974 (Yugoslavia scored six against Zaire in the first half one day earlier), and the first in a knockout-stage game since Austria beat Switzerland in 1954. • Germany's seven goals broke a record for most scored in a semifinal, previously at six, held by Uruguay and Argentina in 1930, and West Germany in 1954. No one had even scored five in a semi since Brazil beat France 5-2 in 1958.  • The six-goal margin of victory also broke the record of five in World Cup semifinals. • Germany are now the all-time top scoring team in World Cup history with 223 goals. They passed Brazil at 220 in the first half. • Germany have taken a 5-0 lead three previous times in the World Cup -- against Saudi Arabia in 2002 (8-0 final), Mexico in 1978 (6-0) and Switzerland in 1966 (5-0). • Germany reached the World Cup final for the eighth time, more times than any other country. • Thomas Muller is the 13th player to score 10 career World Cup goals, and the second player to score five goals at consecutive World Cups after Klose in 2002 and 2006. Miroslav Klose and Germany flew out to a 5-0 lead in the first half against Brazil en route to a 7-1 win. Grounded Brazil • Brazil's six-goal defeat equals their worst loss in team history -- 6-0 to Uruguay in the 1920 Copa America. • Brazil had not allowed five goals in an entire World Cup since 1998. They allowed four in five matches in 2010, two in five matches in 2006, and four in seven matches in 2002. • Brazil had never before trailed by four goals in any World Cup match. That's 102 previous matches. • Brazil have allowed five goals in official games just eight times -- six in 1940 or earlier, and twice in 1963. Six goals? Not since 1940. Seven? Not since an 8-4 friendly defeat to Yugoslavia in 1934. • The previous worst defeats for a host nation at a World Cup were by three goals -- South Africa's 3-0 loss to Uruguay in 2010, Mexico's 4-1 loss to Italy in 1970 and Sweden's 5-2 loss to Brazil in the 1958 final. • Brazil lost at home in a competitive match for the first time since the 1975 Copa America to Peru -- a period of 63 games. • The last time Brazil lost a World Cup match at home was the 1950 final, which caused the team to change its kit.	sports

Epic rivals reunite in Sao Paulo - ESPN FC	Having settled it like no one else could, Dennis Bergkamp summed it up like no one else could. "You're in that moment," the former Netherlands No. 10 told UK Magazine The Blizzard. "That moment", of course, was the goal; his historic and hysterically excellent strike in the Netherlands' 2-1 victory over Argentina in the 1998 World Cup quarterfinals. "That's the feeling," Bergkamp enthused. "After the first two touches, that moment! You give absolutely everything. It's like your life has led up this moment. "You never play the perfect game. But the moment itself was, I think, perfect." It's certainly difficult to dispute. Consider the dimensions, and not just of Frank De Boer's supremely flighted long-range diagonal pass to find Bergkamp in the first place. That came in the last minute of a match in which both sides were dramatically reduced to 10 men but all had given 100 percent. Somehow, Bergkamp still had more to offer. Dennis Bergkamp's spectacular winner against Argentina is still one of the greatest goals ever in the World Cup. He provided a finesse that transcended such figures, that went beyond normal descriptions. It went beyond normal talent. Sprinting at almost full pace, the forward still had the awareness and precision to kill the ball with one touch, take Roberto Ayala completely out of the picture with the next, and then deliver the deftest of finishes. The economy of touch and space were the inverse of the outlandish excellence. Rarely has one moment seen such a maximisation of talent in such minimalist circumstances. Rarely has one action so defined and reflected a single player's entire career. Rarely has such a high-profile and brilliant match seen such an appropriate crescendo. Speaking on the eve of the latest rematch between the Netherlands and Argentina, on the even more elevated World Cup stage of the semifinals, Javier Mascherano recalled his emotions. The midfielder, who was 14 at the time, can remember exactly where he was, but then few could forget it. "I was at home watching it on television and I was just as disappointed as everyone else." Well, every one else who was Argentinean, that is. The rest of the football-watching world couldn't help but be uplifted, even elated. It has also been something of a theme of this fixture. If Bergkamp is right and there is no "perfect game", these two countries possibly provide the perfect knockout pairing. Getting Ready For Argentina vs. Netherlands: - McIntyre: Argentina's defense rising to occasion - Delaney: Old foes reunite in Argentina vs. Netherlands - McIntyre: Superstars collide in Messi vs. Robben - Cox: Four teams, four key battles - Marcotti: Previewing the World Cup semifinals - World Cup Power Rankings: Germany on top - Ames: Gamesmanship alive and well Although the rivalries of Argentina-England and Italy-Germany can stand alongside it, very few other fixtures have fostered such a concentration of quality and combination of so many different dramatic elements over the span of so many years. Even their first match, a 4-0 Dutch win in the 1974 second group stage, heralded the full rise of Rinus Michels' Total Football team. Since then, two knockout matches -- the 1978 final (an 3-1 win for Argentina) and 1998 quarterfinal -- have raised the pulse. Those games saw relentless action, attacking football, star players making defining statements, so many individual moments of brilliance, historic teams coming together, and awful lot of controversy, and barely believable climaxes. It says so much that both of those games came down to the final minute and the tightest of margins. The 1978 final, in Argentina's capital Buenos Aires, was played under the most oppressive of circumstances. Given the political situation in Argentina at the time, it almost seems trivial to discuss a football match in that context, but the influence of the military regime undeniably conditioned some of this match. The Argentine squad were themselves under huge pressure, but also subjected Italian referee Segio Gonella to some. The home squad complained about a arm cast bandage worn by Rene van der Kerkhof, which led to immediate reactions from the Dutch and threats to walk off. The situation was eventually resolved, but the game kicked off late and led to an atmosphere that the Netherlands camp later described as "boiling." That could be seen all too quickly, as brutal tackles began to fly in. The tournament's outstanding player, Mario Kempes, still kept his cool as hit his fifth goal of the World Cup to give Argentina a 1-0 lead in the 38th minute before Dirk Nanninga hit an equaliser at the 82nd minute. Kempes would then hit the effective winner 15 minutes into extra-time, before Daniel Bertoni rounded things off. Mario Kempes scored the game-deciding goal for Argentina in the 1978 final against the Netherlands. The ticker-tape fell at the Estadio Monumental and the World Cup had one of its most evocative sights, but it could have all gone so differently. After Nanninga's leveler, at the 90th minute, his teammate Rob Rensenbrink was presented with the chance for the winner. It rolled against the post. "If the trajectory of my shot had been five centimetres different, we would have been world champions," Rensenbrink himself told David Winner for the book "Brilliant Orange" years later. "On top of that, I would have been crowned top scorer and perhaps chosen as the best player of the tournament -- all in the same match. That's why I keep things in perspective." Bergkamp certainly displayed perspective 20 years later, as that quarterfinal worked out so differently. It could also have gone in a rather different direction, as the Netherlands' 2-1 victory remains one of the great World Cup games of the modern era. It was not just its unpredictable and immensely entertaining pattern. It was the high tempo and quality at which it was all played out. Wim Jonk set a certain standard with a brilliant snap-shot early on. It may have hit the post, but the bar was raised. Bergkamp himself then foreshadowed what was to come with a gorgeous cushioned header to set up Patrick Kluivert's sharp opening goal, before Claudio Lopez then played poker with Edwin van der Sar before finishing just as excellently. From there, the game flowed, multiple chances were created, two players were sent off. Arthur Numan received a second booking, Ariel Ortega was red-carded for headbutting van der Sar. The game still hadn't reached true boiling point. Bergkamp would raise the temperature. This is what the match in Sao Paulo has to live up to. At least the fixture has perfect form.

Dutch on verge of eclipsing forebears - ESPN FC	SAO PAULO -- Sundown, Soccer City, Soweto, July 10, 2010. Dutch players complete the last training session before they take the stage for their nation's third World Cup final. Wesley Sneijder is at shooting practice as Dirk Kuyt and Mark van Bommel serve as a surrogate crowd, cheering and booing successful and unsuccessful attempts. They are a tactile bunch. Many an embrace is exchanged. They look to be enjoying each other's company. "They have to be themselves and have to have the courage to play football against Spain," says coach Bert van Marwijk in the news conference that follows. "I'm not going to tell you how I'm going to play. We just have to be ourselves." Fast-forward 28 hours and Van Marwijk's team were vilified for their role in perhaps the World Cup's most shameful final. That previously jolly bunch became cloggers, responsible for dragging South Africa's showpiece down. Spain's players acted up. During the first half, their play-acting was almost as putrefying, but the act of violence committed by Nigel de Jong, who unleashed a chest-high karate kick on Xabi Alonso, was the flashpoint. "Having seen it again from my armchair, I would red-card him," English referee Howard Webb later admitted. De Jong acquired a deeper pariah status than Johnny Heitinga, later sent off for two very bookable offences. Perhaps if Webb had enjoyed a better view of the incident -- he was unsighted behind Alonso -- then the Dutch players might have become "10 lions and one stupid boy," to borrow the Daily Mirror headline that heralded England's players and targeted David Beckham at France '98. The team that lost 2010's final will never be remembered as fondly as those who fell at the last hurdles of 1974 and 1978 -- Johan Cruyff's Brilliant Oranje, and then Rob Rensenbrink's shot against the post in the belly of the Argentine beast in Buenos Aires. Netherlands vs. Argentina: July 9, 4 ET (ESPN and WatchESPN) - Stats: Diego Maradona vs. Lionel Messi - McIntyre: Superstars collide in Messi vs. Robben - Brewin: Van Gaal's management style - Brassell: Semifinalists have much to lose - Honigstein: Kuyt an unsung hero for the Dutch - Cox: Key semifinal matchups - Marcotti: Then there were four at the World Cup - Five Aside: Dutch, Argentina look to overcome past Netherlands managers work with public expectation of playing open, creative football in the tradition of Cruyff, although that forgets that his generation was no stranger to the dark arts. At the 1976 European championship, the Dutch exited from the semifinals to Czechoslovakia when both Johan Neeskens and Wim van Hanegem were dismissed, and Cruyff received, for dissent, the yellow card that would keep him from the final. Even before Soccer City, Van Marwijk faced criticism of his chosen style of play. The use of Van Bommel and De Jong as a double pivot was a constant source of tension with the straight-talking Dutch press corps, even after a thrilling semifinal victory over Uruguay. Van Marwijk's reputation never recovered. In February 2012, after his team had beaten England 3-2 at Wembley, he got into a lengthy, heated news conference discussion with a Dutch journalist. "I don't want to translate it all, but he thinks Holland should play better and he doesn't agree," explained the interpreter. Euro 2012 was disastrous, and ended with the infighting that usually accompanies Dutch failure. Van Bommel and De Jong's partnership was again criticised as their team bombed in Ukraine. In Brazil, Louis van Gaal had to bear similar criticism for beating Chile by soaking up a significant deficit in possession and scoring two goals on the break. Van Gaal is even more combative than his predecessor, but there is a sense that the Dutch media are much more impressed with this outfit than in 2010. Going so far in South America was not expected, even if the Dutch did reach that final in 1978. Nigel de Jong has transitioned from villain to a central figure in Louis van Gaal's Dutch side. A flurry of goals in the group stage, especially in destroying their 2010 conquerors, has bought Van Gaal admiration. The main players are the same, but Arjen Robben is now the most important. Robben looked like being remembered for missing two chances in 2010's final but he arrived in Sao Paulo as perhaps the outstanding remaining player in the tournament, with only Lionel Messi in his way. "Look how important he is to us with his threat," Stefan de Vrij -- one of the generation of Dutch-based defenders with whom Van Gaal has replaced Van Marwijk's functional and experienced back line -- said about Robben. Van Marwijk usually stuck to a rigid four, but now Van Gaal has switched formations throughout, including using Kuyt as a very effective wing-back. "I'm a coach who likes to work with an established system," Van Marwijk said a month ago while expressing worries about Van Gaal's switches to 5-3-2. Van Gaal has proved himself to be exactly the opposite, while the bravery of his switches -- the introduction of Tim Krul against Costa Rica, in particular -- has masked flat spots like those against Australia, Mexico and in the weekend's quarterfinal. De Jong has been resurrected as a key man, a lone holder to please the Dutch aesthetic, and there was much hope on Tuesday that he could return from his thigh injury. What would seem a less able squad than 2010's, with considerably less experience, has reached the edge of matching, and maybe even surpassing, their fated forebears.	sports

Epic rivals reunite in Sao Paulo - ESPN FC	Having settled it like no one else could, Dennis Bergkamp summed it up like no one else could. "You're in that moment," the former Netherlands No. 10 told UK Magazine The Blizzard. "That moment", of course, was the goal; his historic and hysterically excellent strike in the Netherlands' 2-1 victory over Argentina in the 1998 World Cup quarterfinals. "That's the feeling," Bergkamp enthused. "After the first two touches, that moment! You give absolutely everything. It's like your life has led up this moment. "You never play the perfect game. But the moment itself was, I think, perfect." It's certainly difficult to dispute. Consider the dimensions, and not just of Frank De Boer's supremely flighted long-range diagonal pass to find Bergkamp in the first place. That came in the last minute of a match in which both sides were dramatically reduced to 10 men but all had given 100 percent. Somehow, Bergkamp still had more to offer. Dennis Bergkamp's spectacular winner against Argentina is still one of the greatest goals ever in the World Cup. He provided a finesse that transcended such figures, that went beyond normal descriptions. It went beyond normal talent. Sprinting at almost full pace, the forward still had the awareness and precision to kill the ball with one touch, take Roberto Ayala completely out of the picture with the next, and then deliver the deftest of finishes. The economy of touch and space were the inverse of the outlandish excellence. Rarely has one moment seen such a maximisation of talent in such minimalist circumstances. Rarely has one action so defined and reflected a single player's entire career. Rarely has such a high-profile and brilliant match seen such an appropriate crescendo. Speaking on the eve of the latest rematch between the Netherlands and Argentina, on the even more elevated World Cup stage of the semifinals, Javier Mascherano recalled his emotions. The midfielder, who was 14 at the time, can remember exactly where he was, but then few could forget it. "I was at home watching it on television and I was just as disappointed as everyone else." Well, every one else who was Argentinean, that is. The rest of the football-watching world couldn't help but be uplifted, even elated. It has also been something of a theme of this fixture. If Bergkamp is right and there is no "perfect game", these two countries possibly provide the perfect knockout pairing. Getting Ready For Argentina vs. Netherlands: - McIntyre: Argentina's defense rising to occasion - Delaney: Old foes reunite in Argentina vs. Netherlands - McIntyre: Superstars collide in Messi vs. Robben - Cox: Four teams, four key battles - Marcotti: Previewing the World Cup semifinals - World Cup Power Rankings: Germany on top - Ames: Gamesmanship alive and well Although the rivalries of Argentina-England and Italy-Germany can stand alongside it, very few other fixtures have fostered such a concentration of quality and combination of so many different dramatic elements over the span of so many years. Even their first match, a 4-0 Dutch win in the 1974 second group stage, heralded the full rise of Rinus Michels' Total Football team. Since then, two knockout matches -- the 1978 final (an 3-1 win for Argentina) and 1998 quarterfinal -- have raised the pulse. Those games saw relentless action, attacking football, star players making defining statements, so many individual moments of brilliance, historic teams coming together, and awful lot of controversy, and barely believable climaxes. It says so much that both of those games came down to the final minute and the tightest of margins. The 1978 final, in Argentina's capital Buenos Aires, was played under the most oppressive of circumstances. Given the political situation in Argentina at the time, it almost seems trivial to discuss a football match in that context, but the influence of the military regime undeniably conditioned some of this match. The Argentine squad were themselves under huge pressure, but also subjected Italian referee Segio Gonella to some. The home squad complained about a arm cast bandage worn by Rene van der Kerkhof, which led to immediate reactions from the Dutch and threats to walk off. The situation was eventually resolved, but the game kicked off late and led to an atmosphere that the Netherlands camp later described as "boiling."

Angel Di Maria injury Argentina - ESPN FC	Angel Di Maria has played a crucial role in helping Argentina reach the semifinals and his absence is a setback for La Albiceleste. In years to come, we might well remember Lionel Messi's pass to Ángel Di María during the first half of Argentina vs. Belgium as one of the best in World Cup history. I suspect, however, that most will be less quick to remember what happened next; a cut inside and a shot from Di María which resulted in him pulling up. Minutes later he had to be substituted and the following day Argentina's head doctor Daniel Martínez confirmed he'll miss Wednesday's semifinal against Netherlands. Di María's technical and tactical abilities are important for Argentina, of course, but they're arguably secondary and tertiary, in some ways, to the one thing that sets him aside from almost every other player in the world: the ability to run, run, run some more and then keep running long after everyone else has stopped. - McIntyre: Robben vs. Messi -- Stars collide - Top Tenner: World Cup semifinals So how will Argentina be affected by not having their Duracell bunny in midfield? There are a couple of possibilities and at the time of writing it's not clear which Alejandro Sabella is going to use. The first is that Argentina stick to the rough 4-4-2 they employed against Belgium, with Ezequiel Lavezzi on the left of midfield, bringing a replacement in on the right. That might be Benfica midfielder Enzo Pérez -- the tactically versatile utility man who had an excellent season just gone as a defensive midfielder but can also play further forward -- or it could be former Liverpool winger Maxi Rodríguez. Pérez replaced Di María against Belgium but of course by the time that happened Argentina were already a goal up, so whether Sabella will go with him from the start if the 4-4-2 is the system of choice isn't clear. All the same, the Benfica player seems to be the favourite at present to start on the right. That could change, however, if Sabella decides that the best way to counter the threat of the Dutch attack is a return to the 5-3-2 used in the opening match against Bosnia-Herzegovina. Marcos Rojo seems set to return from suspension at left back whatever, so the back five would see José Basanta move into the middle and Ezequiel Lavezzi dropped from left midfield to accommodate Rojo; Rojo and Basanta would thus be charged with doubling up on Arjen Robben on the Dutch right. If that strategy is used, it seems most likely that Argentina's midfield three would consist (from right to left) of Pérez, Javier Mascherano and Lucas Biglia. That seems uninspiring, but crucially it has a lot more balance to it than the midfield three used so poorly in the Bosnia-Herzegovina match; Maxi Rodríguez played on the right in that trio (with Mascherano and Di María), and hared up the pitch every time Argentina won the ball back, leaving Mascherano with no-one to give it to. Clearly, however Argentina line up they'll be weaker for Di María's exclusion. Whether he's played well or not, his running has provided a spark from midfield to complement Lionel Messi's iron will and nerves of steel which have defined Argentina's tournament so far. Without Di María, adaptation will be essential for Argentina's survival. On Wednesday, we'll learn a lot about just how versatile this side really are.	sports

That came in the last minute of a match in which both sides were dramatically reduced to 10 men but all had given 100 percent. Somehow, Bergkamp still had more to offer. Dennis Bergkamp's spectacular winner against Argentina is still one of the greatest goals ever in the World Cup. He provided a finesse that transcended such figures, that went beyond normal descriptions. It went beyond normal talent. Sprinting at almost full pace, the forward still had the awareness and precision to kill the ball with one touch, take Roberto Ayala completely out of the picture with the next, and then deliver the deftest of finishes. The economy of touch and space were the inverse of the outlandish excellence. Rarely has one moment seen such a maximisation of talent in such minimalist circumstances. Rarely has one action so defined and reflected a single player's entire career. Rarely has such a high-profile and brilliant match seen such an appropriate crescendo. Speaking on the eve of the latest rematch between the Netherlands and Argentina, on the even more elevated World Cup stage of the semifinals, Javier Mascherano recalled his emotions. The midfielder, who was 14 at the time, can remember exactly where he was, but then few could forget it. "I was at home watching it on television and I was just as disappointed as everyone else." Well, every one else who was Argentinean, that is. The rest of the football-watching world couldn't help but be uplifted, even elated. It has also been something of a theme of this fixture. If Bergkamp is right and there is no "perfect game", these two countries possibly provide the perfect knockout pairing. Getting Ready For Argentina vs. Netherlands: - McIntyre: Argentina's defense rising to occasion - Delaney: Old foes reunite in Argentina vs. Netherlands - McIntyre: Superstars collide in Messi vs. Robben - Cox: Four teams, four key battles - Marcotti: Previewing the World Cup semifinals - World Cup Power Rankings: Germany on top - Ames: Gamesmanship alive and well Although the rivalries of Argentina-England and Italy-Germany can stand alongside it, very few other fixtures have fostered such a concentration of quality and combination of so many different dramatic elements over the span of so many years. Even their first match, a 4-0 Dutch win in the 1974 second group stage, heralded the full rise of Rinus Michels' Total Football team. Since then, two knockout matches -- the 1978 final (an 3-1 win for Argentina) and 1998 quarterfinal -- have raised the pulse. Those games saw relentless action, attacking football, star players making defining statements, so many individual moments of brilliance, historic teams coming together, and awful lot of controversy, and barely believable climaxes. It says so much that both of those games came down to the final minute and the tightest of margins. The 1978 final, in Argentina's capital Buenos Aires, was played under the most oppressive of circumstances. Given the political situation in Argentina at the time, it almost seems trivial to discuss a football match in that context, but the influence of the military regime undeniably conditioned some of this match. The Argentine squad were themselves under huge pressure, but also subjected Italian referee Segio Gonella to some. The home squad complained about a arm cast bandage worn by Rene van der Kerkhof, which led to immediate reactions from the Dutch and threats to walk off. The situation was eventually resolved, but the game kicked off late and led to an atmosphere that the Netherlands camp later described as "boiling." That could be seen all too quickly, as brutal tackles began to fly in. The tournament's outstanding player, Mario Kempes, still kept his cool as hit his fifth goal of the World Cup to give Argentina a 1-0 lead in the 38th minute before Dirk Nanninga hit an equaliser at the 82nd minute. Kempes would then hit the effective winner 15 minutes into extra-time, before Daniel Bertoni rounded things off. Mario Kempes scored the game-deciding goal for Argentina in the 1978 final against the Netherlands. The ticker-tape fell at the Estadio Monumental and the World Cup had one of its most evocative sights, but it could have all gone so differently. After Nanninga's leveler, at the 90th minute, his teammate Rob Rensenbrink was presented with the chance for the winner. It rolled against the post. "If the trajectory of my shot had been five centimetres different, we would have been world champions," Rensenbrink himself told David Winner for the book "Brilliant Orange" years later. "On top of that, I would have been crowned top scorer and perhaps chosen as the best player of the tournament -- all in the same match. That's why I keep things in perspective." Bergkamp certainly displayed perspective 20 years later, as that quarterfinal worked out so differently. It could also have gone in a rather different direction, as the Netherlands' 2-1 victory remains one of the great World Cup games of the modern era. It was not just its unpredictable and immensely entertaining pattern. It was the high tempo and quality at which it was all played out. Wim Jonk set a certain standard with a brilliant snap-shot early on. It may have hit the post, but the bar was raised. Bergkamp himself then foreshadowed what was to come with a gorgeous cushioned header to set up Patrick Kluivert's sharp opening goal, before Claudio Lopez then played poker with Edwin van der Sar before finishing just as excellently. From there, the game flowed, multiple chances were created, two players were sent off. Arthur Numan received a second booking, Ariel Ortega was red-carded for headbutting van der Sar. The game still hadn't reached true boiling point. Bergkamp would raise the temperature. This is what the match in Sao Paulo has to live up to. At least the fixture has perfect form.

Alejandro Sabella and Argentina face the Netherlands in World Cup semifinal - ESPN FC	BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil -- Take one look at the four remaining managers in the World Cup and the children's song "One of These Things Is Not Like the Others" immediately springs to mind. You have his eminence, the Netherlands' Louis van Gaal, quick to joust with anyone he thinks is his intellectual subordinate, which is just about everybody. There is another big personality in Brazil's Luiz Felipe "Big Phil" Scolari. There is a presence about Germany's Joachim Low as well, and all three coaches are household names. And then you have Argentina's Alejandro Sabella. The man nicknamed "The Sloth" -- from his days as a creative, but not especially mobile, midfielder -- is as low key as you can get. He is a coach who doesn't look especially comfortable in the spotlight, preferring to work behind the scenes with his players. Brazil 1-7 Germany -- reaction - Marcotti: Scolari at a loss to explain - Jones: Seven stages of grief for Brazil - Duarte: Haunting defeat for the Selecao - Delaney: Three Points - Brazil broken by Germany - Low: German plan worked perfectly - Behind the Numbers: Germany's historic win - Photo Gallery: Best of Brazil vs. Germany - Klose breaks World Cup goals record | Highlight - Social reaction: Brazil, did that just happen? If that image is at odds with his fellow semifinal managers, it's even more jarring when compared to some of his predecessors as Argentina manager. Alfio "Coco" Basile's basso profundo voice could dominate a room. There was the larger-than-life character that is Diego Maradona, whose emotions always meant he managed more with his heart than his head. One could argue that the trend toward less bombast started with Sabella's immediate predecessor, Sergio Batista, but even he is a more charismatic figure. Yet perhaps the departure from such big personalities is precisely what Argentina needed at this World Cup. Sabella served his apprenticeship as the longtime assistant to another large presence, former Argentina manager Daniel Passarella, and was long considered the tactical brain to complement his mentor's strengths as a motivator. When Sabella finally took on his first managerial role with Estudiantes de La Plata in 2009, he immediately turned the club around, winning the 2009 Copa Libertadores and the 2010 Apertura championship. Alejandro Sabella may be understated, but his ability to get results is beyond reproach. Such success, and Sabella's more thoughtful approach, made a believer out of Juan Sebastian Veron, who not only captained that Estudiantes side but at one point did the same for Argentina. "[Sabella] is a coach who transmits tranquility to the team," Veron told the BBC. "He is very concerned with detail, preparing for each match by going over everything that could happen on the pitch. From a strategic point of view, he is really intelligent during the game." He has also managed to get the most out of Lionel Messi. In some respects, Sabella's approach isn't demonstrably different than Maradona's. Both gave Messi complete tactical freedom, and Sabella has surrounded him with many of the same players as four years ago, including Angel di Maria, Gonzalo Higuain and Sergio Aguero. Now those players all have more experience. And matters certainly improved for both Messi and Sabella after Argentina junked the 5-3-2 approach for a more Messi-friendly 4-3-3. Messi has been given more of the credit for the change than Sabella, creating the impression that it is the player who runs the show. It's an interesting narrative, but one that doesn't always match reality. It was Sabella who cut Messi's good friend, Ever Banega, from the final 23-man roster. When Sabella felt that another Messi confidante, Fernando Gago, wasn't performing well, he made the decision to drop him against Belgium. Certainly it's difficult to argue with the results, for both the team and the player. Argentina has won five matches in a row, and Messi has had a hand in five of the Albiceleste's eight goals at this World Cup, scoring four of them. The cacophony of complaints that the Barcelona man has delivered only for his club and not his country has diminished under Sabella's guidance. "[Sabella] forms extremely good groups," said Veron. "He has finally managed to get Messi operating to his full potential after the highs and lows before, but it has not come at the group's expense." Sabella's critics say he is putting too much pressure on Lionel Messi. But some are still unconvinced by Sabella's usage of one of the best players in the world. "It seems to me that Argentina today has no idea," Maradona told Spanish outlet AS after Argentina edged Switzerland 1-0 in the round of 16. "In the first half, the team did not have one chance. My team were a lot more offensive than this one. It looks bleak for us, if I'm honest. I wish the team played differently, that it exploited all the ability its players have." The team may be less offensive, but it also has more balance than Maradona's edition, a point driven home by the quarterfinal against Belgium. It's a result that has changed perceptions a bit, as it was Higuain's goal that proved to be the difference, and Sabella's personnel changes in the back effectively shackled Belgium's impressive array of attacking talent. The Albiceleste have conceded just three goals in five matches. Even then, Belgium manager Marc Wilmots described Argentina as "ordinary." But so long as Argentina keeps winning, that will be just fine with Sabella. As a World Cup-winning manager, once again he'll be different than almost all the rest.	sports

Netherlands vs. Argentina: 50-50 Challenge - ESPN FC	It's a repeat of the 1978 World Cup final as the Netherlands face Argentina in Sao Paulo on Wednesday, with just one more match between the teams and a place at the Maracana. The Netherlands reached the final in 2010 while Argentina, winners 36 years ago, are in the semifinals for the fourth time in their history. Elko Born (Netherlands) and Sam Kelly (Argentina) preview the clash. Sum up your tournament so far Elko Born: The tournament has been a dream so far, with everything going right at exactly the right moment, from Robin van Persie's wonder goal in the first match to Arjen Robben's form and manager Louis van Gaal's audacious substitution against Costa Rica. There is almost a feeling the match against Argentina can hardly go wrong. Should the Argentines take the lead then surely Robben or Van Persie will step up or Van Gaal will come up with more magic. Sam Kelly: Historic. It's not been as free-scoring as Argentina would have liked and it's been very nervy at times, but the Rubicon has been crossed; for the first time since 1930, Argentina have reached a World Cup semifinal without either being the host nation (1978) or having Diego Maradona in the squad (1986 and 1990). And for the first time since losing the 1990 final -- the third World Cup final out of four that Argentina had featured in -- they've got past the quarters. It's not been all sunshine and roses. They've lost Angel Di Maria for the semifinal at least and there might be a minor concern about some of the finishing on Saturday, because in truth given how the game went, Argentina should probably have beaten Belgium by more than one goal. But key changes were made and worked, and key players who hadn't previously stepped up (I'm looking at you, Gonzalo Higuain) did so magnificently. Everything might finally be coming together. World Cup history between the two countries EB: There is, of course, Dennis Bergkamp's classic goal in the quarterfinal of the World Cup in 1998. But the most memorable match between the Netherlands and Argentina was played in 1978, when the countries faced each other in the final of the World Cup. The Netherlands, still disappointed from narrowly missing out on the ultimate prize in 1974, lost 2-1 after extra time and were once again left empty-handed. This, as you can imagine, has not been forgotten. Among fans and in the media, the word "revenge" is being tossed around. SK: This will be the fifth meeting between these nations at the World Cup. The Netherlands have won two -- a 4-0 win in Gelsenkirchen on their way to the final in 1974, and a 2-1 win in Marseille in 1998, decided by that brilliant Bergkamp effort as Elko says. The most recent meeting, during the 2006 group stage, brought the only competitive draw between the sides, a 0-0 in Frankfurt. Argentina's sole World Cup win -- indeed, their only win, because they've never won a friendly -- against the Netherlands was the 3-1 extra-time victory (it had finished 1-1 after 90 minutes) in the Estadio Monumental in the final of the 1978 World Cup. For most Argentines, 1978 is a tainted victory due to the military junta's attempts (very possibly successful) to swing things the home side's way. As such, taking out the Netherlands this time round could also be painted as a win over one of the darker parts of Argentina's own history (off the pitch as well as on it). What are your expectations for the rest of the tournament? EB: Ahead of the tournament most fans did not expect the Netherlands to get very far. Consequently, reaching the semifinal can already be seen as a huge success. But after a series of convincing victories, the Dutch now think they can win the World Cup and with the empowering feeling of confidence now instilled in the Oranje, it is difficult to simply dismiss this assertion completely. After the lost finals of 1974, 1978 and 2010, will it finally happen? Or is desire clouding judgement too much, and have the Dutch been a little lucky to get this far? - Macintosh: Van Gaal has gumption to spare SK: Two very tight semifinals but, just possibly, a more open final. As for how Argentina will do in their final two matches, they need to improve still, but the good news is that they already seem to have begun to step things up somewhat. Excellent in the first half against a Belgium side that offered them more space than they'd had in the previous round, they could have been further ahead but controlled the game pretty effectively even without the ball in the second half. Of the changes last time, Marcos Rojo should return from suspension to replace Jose Basanta at left-back, but Martin Demichelis will surely keep his place alongside Ezequiel Garay in the centre of defence; Demichelis looked far better than Federico Fernandez, and crucially Garay also looked more at ease with the experience of the Manchester City man alongside him. Given their potential for improvement and the fact they've done so in small bursts so far in the tournament, I think Argentina are narrow favourites for the semi -- particularly with Nigel de Jong injured for the Netherlands. Angel Di Maria's injury is a setback for Argentina, who have benefitted from the Real Madrid man's tireless running. Key battle EB: As one of the best footballers of the world, Lionel Messi is the man the Netherlands fear most, and without the injured defensive midfielder Nigel de Jong, the relatively inexperienced Dutch defence will have to be on their guard. In the case of Messi, though -- and in true Dutch fashion -- the best defence might be the attack. The battle between Argentina and the Netherlands will be a battle between Messi and Robben, the Netherlands' star man up front. On the day of the semifinal, who will perform best? And more importantly: Who will score the most goals? SK: Messi vs. Georginio Wijnaldum. In De Jong's absence, Wijnaldum (and Wesley Sneijder) seems likely to be asked to sit a little deeper in midfield to counter Messi's threat in front of the Dutch defence. If that sounds risky, it could well be; we saw in the first half against Belgium how much Messi finally enjoyed being given the space that came with having just one man marking him, as he produced some wonderful probing passes, including probably the through-ball of the finals so far to set Di Maria up for the shot from which the winger seemed to pick up his injury. It's clear -- all but impossible to deny -- that Argentina rely on Messi, and even with their bit-by-bit improvements so far, that's not likely to change here, particularly with Di Maria out of the equation. If Messi gets the space in midfield to pick up a head of steam on the ball, he could be very dangerous -- perhaps decisively so. Elsewhere on the pitch, how Marcos Rojo deals with Arjen Robben on the Dutch right/Argentine left will also prove important. - Vickery: Argentina fail to thrill Prediction EB: Having seen Dennis Bergkamp's wonder goal against Argentina in 1998 as a child, Robben or Van Persie will feel inspired to do something similar in the dying seconds of the match. The Netherlands will win 2-1. SK: It's very tight to call, but I'm going for Argentina to edge it by a goal again; if I were Dutch, the lack of bite in defensive midfield would be a worry coming up against Messi, while Argentina's own defensive errors were notably less of a problem with Demichelis stepping into the back line against Belgium.	sports

SK: It's very tight to call, but I'm going for Argentina to edge it by a goal again; if I were Dutch, the lack of bite in defensive midfield would be a worry coming up against Messi, while Argentina's own defensive errors were notably less of a problem with Demichelis stepping into the back line against Belgium.	sports
Alejandro Sabella and Argentina face the Netherlands in World Cup semifinal - ESPN FC	BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil -- Take one look at the four remaining managers in the World Cup and the children's song "One of These Things Is Not Like the Others" immediately springs to mind. You have his eminence, the Netherlands' Louis van Gaal, quick to joust with anyone he thinks is his intellectual subordinate, which is just about everybody. There is another big personality in Brazil's Luiz Felipe "Big Phil" Scolari. There is a presence about Germany's Joachim Low as well, and all three coaches are household names. And then you have Argentina's Alejandro Sabella. The man nicknamed "The Sloth" -- from his days as a creative, but not especially mobile, midfielder -- is as low key as you can get. He is a coach who doesn't look especially comfortable in the spotlight, preferring to work behind the scenes with his players. Brazil 1-7 Germany -- reaction - Marcotti: Scolari at a loss to explain - Jones: Seven stages of grief for Brazil - Duarte: Haunting defeat for the Selecao - Delaney: Three Points - Brazil broken by Germany - Low: German plan worked perfectly - Behind the Numbers: Germany's historic win - Photo Gallery: Best of Brazil vs. Germany - Klose breaks World Cup goals record | Highlight - Social reaction: Brazil, did that just happen? If that image is at odds with his fellow semifinal managers, it's even more jarring when compared to some of his predecessors as Argentina manager. Alfio "Coco" Basile's basso profundo voice could dominate a room. There was the larger-than-life character that is Diego Maradona, whose emotions always meant he managed more with his heart than his head. One could argue that the trend toward less bombast started with Sabella's immediate predecessor, Sergio Batista, but even he is a more charismatic figure. Yet perhaps the departure from such big personalities is precisely what Argentina needed at this World Cup. Sabella served his apprenticeship as the longtime assistant to another large presence, former Argentina manager Daniel Passarella, and was long considered the tactical brain to complement his mentor's strengths as a motivator. When Sabella finally took on his first managerial role with Estudiantes de La Plata in 2009, he immediately turned the club around, winning the 2009 Copa Libertadores and the 2010 Apertura championship. Alejandro Sabella may be understated, but his ability to get results is beyond reproach. Such success, and Sabella's more thoughtful approach, made a believer out of Juan Sebastian Veron, who not only captained that Estudiantes side but at one point did the same for Argentina. "[Sabella] is a coach who transmits tranquility to the team," Veron told the BBC. "He is very concerned with detail, preparing for each match by going over everything that could happen on the pitch. From a strategic point of view, he is really intelligent during the game." He has also managed to get the most out of Lionel Messi. In some respects, Sabella's approach isn't demonstrably different than Maradona's. Both gave Messi complete tactical freedom, and Sabella has surrounded him with many of the same players as four years ago, including Angel di Maria, Gonzalo Higuain and Sergio Aguero. Now those players all have more experience. And matters certainly improved for both Messi and Sabella after Argentina junked the 5-3-2 approach for a more Messi-friendly 4-3-3. Messi has been given more of the credit for the change than Sabella, creating the impression that it is the player who runs the show. It's an interesting narrative, but one that doesn't always match reality. It was Sabella who cut Messi's good friend, Ever Banega, from the final 23-man roster. When Sabella felt that another Messi confidante, Fernando Gago, wasn't performing well, he made the decision to drop him against Belgium. Certainly it's difficult to argue with the results, for both the team and the player. Argentina has won five matches in a row, and Messi has had a hand in five of the Albiceleste's eight goals at this World Cup, scoring four of them. The cacophony of complaints that the Barcelona man has delivered only for his club and not his country has diminished under Sabella's guidance. "[Sabella] forms extremely good groups," said Veron. "He has finally managed to get Messi operating to his full potential after the highs and lows before, but it has not come at the group's expense." Sabella's critics say he is putting too much pressure on Lionel Messi. But some are still unconvinced by Sabella's usage of one of the best players in the world. "It seems to me that Argentina today has no idea," Maradona told Spanish outlet AS after Argentina edged Switzerland 1-0 in the round of 16. "In the first half, the team did not have one chance. My team were a lot more offensive than this one. It looks bleak for us, if I'm honest. I wish the team played differently, that it exploited all the ability its players have." The team may be less offensive, but it also has more balance than Maradona's edition, a point driven home by the quarterfinal against Belgium. It's a result that has changed perceptions a bit, as it was Higuain's goal that proved to be the difference, and Sabella's personnel changes in the back effectively shackled Belgium's impressive array of attacking talent. The Albiceleste have conceded just three goals in five matches. Even then, Belgium manager Marc Wilmots described Argentina as "ordinary." But so long as Argentina keeps winning, that will be just fine with Sabella. As a World Cup-winning manager, once again he'll be different than almost all the rest.	sports

Netherlands - ESPN FC	SAO PAULO -- Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella says Enzo Perez is likely to replace injured winger Angel di Maria in the World Cup semifinal against the Netherlands.

Angel Di Maria injury Argentina - ESPN FC	Angel Di Maria has played a crucial role in helping Argentina reach the semifinals and his absence is a setback for La Albiceleste. In years to come, we might well remember Lionel Messi's pass to Ángel Di María during the first half of Argentina vs. Belgium as one of the best in World Cup history. I suspect, however, that most will be less quick to remember what happened next; a cut inside and a shot from Di María which resulted in him pulling up. Minutes later he had to be substituted and the following day Argentina's head doctor Daniel Martínez confirmed he'll miss Wednesday's semifinal against Netherlands. Di María's technical and tactical abilities are important for Argentina, of course, but they're arguably secondary and tertiary, in some ways, to the one thing that sets him aside from almost every other player in the world: the ability to run, run, run some more and then keep running long after everyone else has stopped. - McIntyre: Robben vs. Messi -- Stars collide - Top Tenner: World Cup semifinals So how will Argentina be affected by not having their Duracell bunny in midfield? There are a couple of possibilities and at the time of writing it's not clear which Alejandro Sabella is going to use. The first is that Argentina stick to the rough 4-4-2 they employed against Belgium, with Ezequiel Lavezzi on the left of midfield, bringing a replacement in on the right. That might be Benfica midfielder Enzo Pérez -- the tactically versatile utility man who had an excellent season just gone as a defensive midfielder but can also play further forward -- or it could be former Liverpool winger Maxi Rodríguez. Pérez replaced Di María against Belgium but of course by the time that happened Argentina were already a goal up, so whether Sabella will go with him from the start if the 4-4-2 is the system of choice isn't clear. All the same, the Benfica player seems to be the favourite at present to start on the right. That could change, however, if Sabella decides that the best way to counter the threat of the Dutch attack is a return to the 5-3-2 used in the opening match against Bosnia-Herzegovina. Marcos Rojo seems set to return from suspension at left back whatever, so the back five would see José Basanta move into the middle and Ezequiel Lavezzi dropped from left midfield to accommodate Rojo; Rojo and Basanta would thus be charged with doubling up on Arjen Robben on the Dutch right. If that strategy is used, it seems most likely that Argentina's midfield three would consist (from right to left) of Pérez, Javier Mascherano and Lucas Biglia. That seems uninspiring, but crucially it has a lot more balance to it than the midfield three used so poorly in the Bosnia-Herzegovina match; Maxi Rodríguez played on the right in that trio (with Mascherano and Di María), and hared up the pitch every time Argentina won the ball back, leaving Mascherano with no-one to give it to. Clearly, however Argentina line up they'll be weaker for Di María's exclusion. Whether he's played well or not, his running has provided a spark from midfield to complement Lionel Messi's iron will and nerves of steel which have defined Argentina's tournament so far. Without Di María, adaptation will be essential for Argentina's survival. On Wednesday, we'll learn a lot about just how versatile this side really are.	sports
Superstars collide in Messi vs. Robben - ESPN FC	SAO PAULO -- The eyes of 200 million Brazilians will be turned to the short-handed hosts' do-or-die match against Germany on Tuesday in Belo Horizonte. But it's this World Cup's other marquee semifinal -- between Argentina and the Netherlands -- that will showcase the top two remaining players in the tournament in Lionel Messi and Arjen Robben. That might not have been the case even if Selecao icon Neymar hadn't been forced to withdraw from the competition with a broken back. His injury, which has sent the already-fatalistic outlook of the locals toward even greater depths, came in Friday's win against a Colombia squad led by James Rodriguez, whose six goals lead the competition. Now, it's all about the two leading men in Wednesday's match when it comes to individual supremacy. That opportunity will be in front of them when they face off at Arena Corinthians. The Dutch and Albiceleste are mediocre teams led by exceptional singular talents. Usually, those squads get found out early. Not here, though. Part of the reason Brazil 2014 has been the most entertaining Cup in recent memory is that no team has truly distinguished itself. That means one brilliant individual performance could make the difference. It means there's a good chance that whoever performs better, Robben or Messi, could determine which side advances to Sunday's grand finale in Rio. Most of the attention will be on Messi, of course. The two biggest stars remaining in the World Cup -- Argentina's Lionel Messi and the Netherlands' Arjen Robben -- face off Wednesday. What's at stake for the tiny genius isn't lost on anyone. A World Cup win -- on Brazilian soil, no less -- would be the Albicleleste's first in 28 years, when Argentine deity Diego Maradona carried another decidedly average squad, quite literally single-handedly, to the title. Messi and Maradona are compared everywhere but in their shared homeland, which Messi left as a child and for which he has never been able to duplicate his exploits for club side Barcelona. Victory here may be the best chance he'll ever have of changing that, and it would also cement his legacy as one of the sport's true greats. But first, he'll have to get through the Oranje. And in what's guaranteed to be a tight game -- both teams have prioritized defense in the knockout rounds -- it could come down to one special moment. Odds are against this match being a classic, unlike their epic quarterfinal meeting in 1998. "Argentina was just stopping and slamming on the brakes," was Netherlands coach Louis van Gaal's assessment of the Albiceleste's 1-0 quarterfinal victory over Belgium. Getting Ready For Argentina vs. Netherlands: - McIntyre: Argentina's defense rising to occasion - Delaney: Old foes reunite in Argentina vs. Netherlands - McIntyre: Superstars collide in Messi vs. Robben - Cox: Four teams, four key battles - Marcotti: Previewing the World Cup semifinals - World Cup Power Rankings: Germany on top - Ames: Gamesmanship alive and well Meantime, the Dutch have found it difficult to score, managing just one goal from the run of play in two elimination games. Robben, though, was their best player in both. The Bayern Munich star's embellishment -- and the furor surrounding it -- has overshadowed that somewhat. Costa Rica's only answer for him on Saturday was to hack him down every time he got loose on the right wing. He tired to sell those fouls, sure, but fouls they were. With the ball at his feet, Robben has been the most dangerous player in the tournament so far, and he's finished three chances himself -- just one fewer than Messi. His leadership has also been crucial for the Dutch. "If players say something, that hits home much more than if I do," van Gaal said when asked about Robben's spirited address to his teammates before extra time commenced against the Ticos. Van Gaal praised the camaraderie of this team, a lack of which has famously torpedoed previous Dutch squads. There is a sense that this group is mentally tougher than its predecessors; Saturday's match marked the first time they'd won an extra-time match on the global stage in five tries. That bodes well for them on Wednesday. So does the improving form of playmaker Wesley Sneijder and the expected absence of injured Argentine midfielder Angel Di Maria. Still, not much separates these squads, and Argentina remains the slight odds (3-2) favorite. In the end, expect Robben or Messi to decide the outcome.

Raphael Honigstein pays tribute to Dirk Kuyt, the unsung hero of the Netherlands' World Cup campaign. - ESPN FC	On Sunday night, half a dozen members of the Netherlands squad were having a few quiet drinks at a Rio de Janeiro rooftop bar. Their press officer was with them, so this was obviously happening with the blessing of Louis van Gaal, who can be very strict about these things. (It didn't look as if anyone had any alcohol.) A regular at the bar told us that the Dutch, who had been staying in a nearby hotel on Ipanema beach until Monday (they hadn't been able to book the rooms for longer), had come quite often to escape the confines of their rooms and chill a bit. So far, so unremarkable. That's just the sort of thing the Dutch do. But there was something interesting about this group. All the players were wearing dark tops, and some also had baseball caps, with the overall effect that they almost disappeared into the darkness. The only Dutchman who wasn't at all concerned with keeping a low profile was Dirk Kuyt. The 33-year-old wore a white and orange training jacket, and his blond locks were visible from the distance. Maybe, at his age, he's simply past caring. Or maybe he actually enjoyed a bit of attention during what promises to be his last tournament. Kuyt, it's fair to say, has played a surprisingly big role in the Oranje's progress to the semifinals. He's been a starter in their past three games and should feature again against Argentina on Wednesday. Dirk Kuyt's versatility and commitment have been priceless for the Dutch this summer. The Fenerbahce striker has never been the sort of forward that the Dutch truly appreciate. His game is based on effort, endurance and positional intelligence. As a centre-forward, he's always had better players ahead of him and on the flanks; various coaches have preferred true wingers. Kuyt has been a different sort of specialist: a defensive wide forward. At club level, Rafael Benítez used him most effectively in that hybrid role during his time at Liverpool (2006-12) -- "Mr Duracell," the Spaniard used to call him. Under Marco van Basten, Kuyt played very well on the right in a counterattacking 4-2-3-1 Dutch side at Euro 2008. At the World Cup in South Africa two years later, his work rate contributed, as Bert van Marwijk's well-organised but largely uninspiring side made it to the final. His involvement in Poland/Ukraine 2012, where internal rifts and poor performances resulted in an early exit, only amounted to 12 minutes in two substitute appearances. Few expected the veteran from Katwijk aan Zee, a small city on the North Sea coast, to see so much action in Brazil, but perhaps we should have known something was up after one of the training sessions before the opening game against Spain. Van Gaal had requisitioned Kuyt from the reserves to train with the first-team forwards in Estadio da Gavea -- as a defender. Arjen Robben, Wesley Sneijder, Robin van Persie and a couple of others always outnumbered a two-, three- and four-man defence marshalled by Kuyt as the main centre-back, but they hardly got behind them to score any goals. Kuyt's men were too well positioned. The Dutch media later reported that since May van Gaal had been practising with the former Feyenoord man in various defensive positions. It's easier to list the positions he hasn't played at this World Cup. Apart from goalkeeper and the centre of defence, Kuyt has featured everywhere on the pitch for van Gaal. Against Mexico in the round of 16, Kuyt was used in four different roles by the 62-year-old coach. "He is fantastic; he is ready for everything, from the first to the last second," Kuyt said about van Gaal after the penalty win over Costa Rica. Super-sub Krul inspires Netherlands - Macintosh: Van Gaal has gumption to spare - Van Gaal planned Tim Krul switch all along - McIntyre: Van Gaal's gamble pays dividends - Van Gaal: We could have easily lost - Krul makes the difference in penalties - Dream come true for keeper Tim Krul All those frequent tactical changes are only possible because in Kuyt, the future Man United manager has a player who will selflessly do any task asked of him, and he will do it with maximum effort. "Robben might be the star, Sneijder might be the tragic hero who has sacrificed himself ... but the symbol of this team is Dirk Kuyt," said Johan Cruyff, the high priest of Oranje, who never had too much time for hard workers in the past. "You are blessed with someone like Kuyt. You can go everywhere with him, tactically." The son of a fisherman -- Kuyt himself worked on the trawlers as a teenager before starting his career at Utrecht -- represents the more pragmatic, physical Rotterdam style, but he has ironically become the last link to the old idea of Total Football, too. Dutch footballers were supposed to play in any position and interchange frequently, according to the 1970s textbook, but Cruyff et al never had good, honest runners such as Kuyt in mind. Yet the former Barcelona coach seems to have relaxed his criteria in line with the changed mood in the Netherlands. "They have given up on the way of football we developed," the 67-year-old said. "But something has come in the place of that creativity and dominance. And it works. It is direct and effective, and it is built on passion and team spirit." The actual football is being played by the three guys further up the pitch. Kuyt's importance, however, cannot be underestimated. Not only is his ultra-professional attitude exemplary, but he also helps the dressing room with his sunny and endearingly positive disposition. It's telling that van Gaal appointed him vice-captain when he took over; Kuyt continued in this role despite getting little playing time in the World Cup qualifiers. Kuyt's importance, stamina and versatility cannot be underestimated. On the occasion of his 100th cap for the Netherlands, the round of 16 clash with Mexico, van Persie presented Kuyt with a little gift and gave a short speech. Kuyt became only the seventh "centurion" in the history of the KNVB (Royal Dutch Football Association), and the day coincided with the seventh anniversary of his father's death, too. "I knew that my father would have been proud, but not just for me -- for all the players and the staff," he said. That might not have been the last emotional, historic day for the second-oldest player (behind Germany's Miroslav Klose) left in the competition. "We have a lot of quality, and we will show it to Argentina." Having come this far, Mr. Duracell is not about to slow down now.

Strikers making way for playmakers - ESPN FC	Time is running out for Miroslav Klose. It's precious and of the essence to him. At 36, the Germany striker is playing in his final World Cup. Every game has threatened to be his last since the knockout stage began. Tuesday's semifinal match against Brazil in Belo Horizonte is no different. Klose is hoping to have a place in the starting XI for his fourth consecutive World Cup semifinal. So far in this World Cup, he's made cameo appearances as a substitute and one start, playing only 135 minutes overall. Klose's aim upon making the squad was to score two goals in Brazil. The veteran Lazio forward has managed only one, sliding in at the far post to equalise against Ghana in the group stage. That strike meant Klose matched Ronaldo on 15 goals as the all-time leading scorer in World Cup history. Imagine if Klose were to break the record against Brazil. Wouldn't that be something? If the moment comes, he will have to seize it. And besides, Klose should perhaps consider himself lucky to be in the Germany squad at all. He is the only nominal centre-forward Low decided to take. Germany's talent distribution, after all, is disproportionately in or between the lines of midfield and attack. Still, the prevailing sensation from this World Cup is that it has been hard on the orthodox striker in general. That might sound foolish considering 2.8 goals per game were scored during the group stages. Were centre-forwards not among them? Didn't they take advantage? Not as much as you'd think. Of the players classified as more or less typical No. 9s, only Karim Benzema (even though he wears No. 10), Robin van Persie (a self-proclaimed 9 and a half), Wilfried Bony, Mario Mandzukic, Jackson Martinez, Clint Dempsey, Asamoah Gyan, Islam Slimani and Enner Valencia scored two or more goals. Miroslav Klose needs just one more goal to break Ronaldo's record as the World Cup's all-time record goal scorer. It's perhaps a surprise considering that some countries came into the World Cup with frightening firepower. Argentina looked top-heavy, as did Colombia in spite of Radamel Falcao's injury-enforced absence, while Uruguay's strike partnership of Edinson Cavani and Luis Suarez is about to become the most expensive in aggregated transfer fees (although they played together for only 178 minutes on account of Suarez's recovery from knee surgery and then his bite on Giorgio Chiellini). For several reasons varying from poor form to issues of fitness and not being in the side, few have imposed themselves on the tournament. Argentina's Gonzalo Higuain, for instance, only got on the score sheet in the quarterfinals against Belgium. Many are asking whether he could follow in the footsteps of Italy's Paolo Rossi in 1982. The World Cup winner didn't find the back of the net until his fifth appearance in Spain and then couldn't stop in a blaze of glory. Argentines are sure hoping Higuain imitates Rossi. Argentina's latent potential up front, how they've kept their powder dry (or at least put it in the hands of one man), could yet spark. Brazil, meanwhile, have little or no gunpowder to speak of. Losing Neymar (another player wearing the symbolic No. 10 shirt on his shoulders, and a wide forward, too, rather than one through the centre) has laid bare how, unlike in years gone by, Brazil no longer have a multitude of world-class, go-to goal scorers. Fred, the leading striker at last summer's Confederations Cup, has become a figure of fun, even if it must be recognised that he is or has been a facilitator for Neymar as much as a finisher for Brazil -- not quite Serginho in 1982, but hardly Stephane Guivarc'h in 1998 either. Then there's Jo. There must be regret that more wasn't done to get Diego Costa to commit to Brazil. His forward play would have been more suited to Brazil's style than to Spain's. He chose Spain -- possibly because he wasn't fully fit. And to be fair, the only European striker who has appeared to meet, if not exceed, expectation at the World Cup is Benzema.

This World Cup has arguably been crying out for one in the knockout stages: six of the eight round-of-16 games were 0-0 at halftime. This has been a World Cup of the No. 1s and No. 10s, not the No. 9s. That's a consequence of modern football -- the prevalence of one-striker and striker-less systems, the preoccupation with not giving your opponent any reference points, and the widening brief of the centre-forward to participate and link up play, to move and drag opponents out of the way to create space for his teammates. Scoring goals used to be his only job. Now a striker is asked to do much more. It brings nostalgia for a Gerd Muller, a Pippo Inzaghi. "He loved goals," Alessandro Del Piero once said of his former Juventus and Italy teammate, "but not as much as the goal loved him." The same is true of Klose. So if you're a neutral fan, will him to score Tuesday night. Do it for your team. Do it for yourself. Do it for the record. But above all, do it for the good old No. 9.

Strikers making way for playmakers - ESPN FC	Time is running out for Miroslav Klose. It's precious and of the essence to him. At 36, the Germany striker is playing in his final World Cup. Every game has threatened to be his last since the knockout stage began. Tuesday's semifinal match against Brazil in Belo Horizonte is no different. Klose is hoping to have a place in the starting XI for his fourth consecutive World Cup semifinal. So far in this World Cup, he's made cameo appearances as a substitute and one start, playing only 135 minutes overall. Klose's aim upon making the squad was to score two goals in Brazil. The veteran Lazio forward has managed only one, sliding in at the far post to equalise against Ghana in the group stage. That strike meant Klose matched Ronaldo on 15 goals as the all-time leading scorer in World Cup history. Imagine if Klose were to break the record against Brazil. Wouldn't that be something? If the moment comes, he will have to seize it. And besides, Klose should perhaps consider himself lucky to be in the Germany squad at all. He is the only nominal centre-forward Low decided to take. Germany's talent distribution, after all, is disproportionately in or between the lines of midfield and attack. Still, the prevailing sensation from this World Cup is that it has been hard on the orthodox striker in general. That might sound foolish considering 2.8 goals per game were scored during the group stages. Were centre-forwards not among them? Didn't they take advantage? Not as much as you'd think. Of the players classified as more or less typical No. 9s, only Karim Benzema (even though he wears No. 10), Robin van Persie (a self-proclaimed 9 and a half), Wilfried Bony, Mario Mandzukic, Jackson Martinez, Clint Dempsey, Asamoah Gyan, Islam Slimani and Enner Valencia scored two or more goals. Miroslav Klose needs just one more goal to break Ronaldo's record as the World Cup's all-time record goal scorer. It's perhaps a surprise considering that some countries came into the World Cup with frightening firepower. Argentina looked top-heavy, as did Colombia in spite of Radamel Falcao's injury-enforced absence, while Uruguay's strike partnership of Edinson Cavani and Luis Suarez is about to become the most expensive in aggregated transfer fees (although they played together for only 178 minutes on account of Suarez's recovery from knee surgery and then his bite on Giorgio Chiellini). For several reasons varying from poor form to issues of fitness and not being in the side, few have imposed themselves on the tournament. Argentina's Gonzalo Higuain, for instance, only got on the score sheet in the quarterfinals against Belgium. Many are asking whether he could follow in the footsteps of Italy's Paolo Rossi in 1982. The World Cup winner didn't find the back of the net until his fifth appearance in Spain and then couldn't stop in a blaze of glory. Argentines are sure hoping Higuain imitates Rossi. Argentina's latent potential up front, how they've kept their powder dry (or at least put it in the hands of one man), could yet spark. Brazil, meanwhile, have little or no gunpowder to speak of. Losing Neymar (another player wearing the symbolic No. 10 shirt on his shoulders, and a wide forward, too, rather than one through the centre) has laid bare how, unlike in years gone by, Brazil no longer have a multitude of world-class, go-to goal scorers. Fred, the leading striker at last summer's Confederations Cup, has become a figure of fun, even if it must be recognised that he is or has been a facilitator for Neymar as much as a finisher for Brazil -- not quite Serginho in 1982, but hardly Stephane Guivarc'h in 1998 either. Then there's Jo. There must be regret that more wasn't done to get Diego Costa to commit to Brazil. His forward play would have been more suited to Brazil's style than to Spain's. He chose Spain -- possibly because he wasn't fully fit. And to be fair, the only European striker who has appeared to meet, if not exceed, expectation at the World Cup is Benzema. The other, more prolific players from the Continent are the unclassifiable Muller, his Bayern teammates (Switzerland's Xherdan Shaqiri and Netherlands winger Arjen Robben) and Robin van Persie.

Small margins for Argentina and Netherlands at the World Cup - ESPN FC	Memories of 1978's final and Dennis Bergkamp's goal at France in 1998 flooded back as soon as Netherlands and Argentina were paired for Sao Paulo's semifinal World Cup match. Both might have a sense of owing the other one. The Dutch's progress to this stage would seem a shock when considering that many thought they would struggle to get out of Group B. But since a 5-1 devastation of Spain, they have held themselves together, and despite slackening off from the fireworks of Salvador, have negotiated two troublesome assignments in Mexico and Costa Rica. Netherlands vs. Argentina: July 9, 4 ET (ESPN and WatchESPN) - Stats: Diego Maradona vs. Lionel Messi - McIntyre: Superstars collide in Messi vs. Robben - Brewin: Van Gaal's management style - Brassell: Semifinalists have much to lose - Honigstein: Kuyt an unsung hero for the Dutch - Cox: Key semifinal matchups - Marcotti: Then there were four at the World Cup - Five Aside: Dutch, Argentina look to overcome past There is, however, the possibility that the Dutch trajectory -- they do seem a little weary -- may be going in the opposite direction to Argentina, whose victory over Belgium was collected with ease. This time Lionel Messi was not the match winner, though -- as expected -- his movements made the whole thing possible. GOALKEEPER This has suddenly become an area of increased interest. Jasper Cillessen has done just fine in normal play for the Dutch, only to be replaced by Tim Krul as Louis van Gaal introduced his version of the baseball "closer." This was Krul's big moment and he grasped it with both hands, going the right way each time a Costa Rican took his kick. The likelihood is that Cillessen will return to his normal job. Or else, Van Gaal is even more ruthless than we thought. Sergio Romero, meanwhile, may well be the lesser goalkeeper left in the tournament, with due nod to Julio Cesar. He has not completely convinced in Brazil, though his showing as Iran piled on the pressure in a group-stage match was as much a match-winner as Messi proved. Still, he has the full faith of Alejandro Sabella, just as he had when Diego Maradona was coach in 2010. Edge: Netherlands Although subbed off for the penalty shoot-out against Costa Rica, Jasper Cillessen is expected to start for the Netherlands in the semifinal. DEFENCE Premier League fans may not be able to believe it, but the injury worry against Ron Vlaar may prove crucial. The Aston Villa stopper has been a relative rock amid a defence that has never looked truly solid. His experience would be missed in Arena Corinthians as the rest of the bunch are callow and far rawer. As ever with Dutch teams, the players are expected to be versatile, and "LVG" may either try a four- or three-man defence. More surprise for Premier League followers: Martin Demichelis' addition made Argentina look more solid than they had for their previous four matches. He is likely to keep his place ahead of Federico Fernandez, while Marcos Rojo, back from suspension, should replace Jose Basanta, who did well enough in Brasilia. Much still depends on the leadership of Ezequiel Garay, and the dedication of Pablo Zabaleta. Edge: Argentina Marcos Rojo, left, and Ezequiel Garay, right, will be relied upon to keep the formidable Dutch attack quiet. MIDFIELDERS The Dutch midfield is all about providing a platform for the three main men to perform, which is not too different from Argentina's approach. Daley Blind, versatile enough to play both defence and midfield, plays as the holder in the absence of Nigel De Jong and he, Georginio Wijnaldum and the redoubtable Dirk Kuyt, who played at left-back against Chile, do the work for Wesley Sneijder to try and create. The absence of Angel di Maria would clearly be a hindrance to Argentina. It is the Real Madrid speedster's running that has been the best counterpoint to Messi. Without him, Argentina's midfield looks like a collection of holders, and without pace. Enzo Perez did fine against the Belgians but the Dutch may increase the need for a greater dynamism. Edge: Netherlands The versatility of Daley Blind has been pivotal for Louis van Gaal. FORWARDS Robin van Persie has slowed down from the brilliance of his performance on the first Friday of the tournament. A series of tough visits to some hot locations around Brazil has not helped him return to the sharpness he showed back then. It has left a considerable burden on Arjen Robben, a leading contender for player of the tournament, but under which this flying Dutchman has flourished. He is certain to be key in Sao Paulo. Lionel Messi, then. We know all about him, but can he be stopped? It may end up being the leading question of World Cup 2014. The Dutch cause may not have been helped by Gonzalo Higuain finally locating his scoring touch in Brasilia, though a loose second-half finish suggested that he is not yet totally deadly. Sergio Aguero is likely to come from the bench, though Sabella suggested on Sunday he has made an "excellent" recovery from his latest muscle problem. Edge: Argentina Sergio Aguero's return from injury could prove timely for Argentina. RESERVES Van Gaal is not blessed with riches beyond his first-team selections, though he has made use of most of his squad -- even the reserve goalie, of course. He has been well served by his subs so far, in fact, with Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scoring the match-winning penalty against Mexico after replacing Van Persie. Sergio Aguero might prove to be a high-grade super-sub for Sabella in Sao Paulo. Sabella has options in attack and midfield with the likes of Rodrigo Palacio, Maxi Rodriguez and Ricky Alvarez. Few of them provide a true variation from what Sabella chooses to start with, though Palacio's switch to midfield against Switzerland did produce Di Maria's winning goal. Edge: Argentina Alejandro Sabella may have to rely on his bench to get Argentina over the line on Wednesday. COACHES Van Gaal is happy to assume credit for his team's successes so far, but then again he probably deserves it, too. No coach in the tournament has shown off such a varied set of formations and tactics, and few are willing to take on such tough calls like those Huntelaar and Krul introductions. Sabella is a strange cove given to talking deep philosophical doggerel in his news conferences. He clearly feels the deep pressure that an expectant nation places on him. Last week he complained that too many back home think his team should win. His furrowed brow is usually on show, as it was when he performed that falling-back exasperation at a Higuain miss that became an instant Vine hit. He has done well in getting Argentina to the semis for the first time since 1990, but looks as if he needs a long holiday. Edge: Netherlands Louis van Gaal cuts an imposing figure both in the dressing room and on the sidelines. INTANGIBLES Both these countries have had, over the years, the ability to come apart at the seams at the wrong time. Sao Paulo may see one of them -- or possibly both -- do just that. There is a sense that the Dutch have hit their target while Argentina and Messi in particular think the World Cup is on. A blue and white backing to the tune of Creedence Clearwater Revival is sure to be heard as the noisy neighbours descend on Brazil's biggest city. PREDICTION Argentina victory, with Messi at the centre. A predictable prediction, perhaps.	sports

Carlos Bianchi the logical candidates are in the semifinals - ESPN FC	BUENOS AIRES -- A few days ago, before the round of 16, I started to write a column saying that the logical semifinals would be Germany-Brazil and Argentina-Holland. But I thought it was very probable that there would be surprises, given that there was not a huge difference between those four teams and those they were up against. In the end there were no surprises, although a few teams came close: Switzerland took Argentina all the way, Brazil had to wait for penalties to knock Chile out, and Holland did the same against Costa Rica. There were several moments in those games where one small incident (the goalpost, a poor finish, a refereeing mistake) was the difference between the winner and the loser. That does not mean that the four semifinalists are not there on merit. Theu were, no doubt, the ones who had the upper hand and always offered more than their opponents. It is no coincidence that they have history and are used to these situations, and in the long run they made that experience count. It is true, though, that not one of the four looked comfortable. They were never far ahead, either on the scoreboard or on the field. Everyone knows that they were better and they deserve to be where they are, but at the same time everyone knows they are in debt. Indeed, that explains why all four are practically equal candidates: They each have something that makes them dare to dream of winning the Cup, but at the same time they also have some problem that might leave them by the wayside. Germany-Brazil Of the four left standing, Germany is the only team that has not had to withstand so much pressure. It also seems to be the only one that has its whole squad fit without any significant absentee. The injuries to Neymar, Angel Di María and Nigel De Jong will certainly have an impact on how the Brazilian, Argentine and Dutch teams respectively perform. Germany lost only Reuss before the tournament, but today it has all its players fit, or at least so it appears. We will soon see if, at some point, they will pay the physical price of having paid so many midday games (three of five) in hot places, as well as the tiring journeys over practically the whole country (Manaus, Salvador, Recife, Porto Alegre and Río de Janeiro, as well as Belo Horizonte on Tuesday). With not many natural forwards, the Germans have found a way to create enough chances anyway. Against France, if they had been more clinical in the final third, the difference would have been bigger. For now, Germany's buildup play is far better than their finishing. Brazil vs. Germany: Tuesday, 4 ET, 9 BST (ESPN and WatchESPN) - Marcotti: Titans collide in the semifinals - Honigstein: Bierhoff's technological focus - Torre: Scolari lightens the mood - Brewin: Battered Brazil vs. vulnerable Germany - Smith: Jogo bonito the exception, not the rule - 50-50 Challenge: Brazil vs. Germany - Duarte: Brazil move past star absences - Cox: Brazil and Germany's role reversal Brazil's defense, which will also be missing their captain Thiago Silva, suspended after another yellow card, doesn't look the best prepared to stop that superpopulated midfield, which can get through on goal anywhere in different ways. If Germany improves its finishing, it has a big chance of getting through to the final in the Maracanã. Germany has, as I see it, two problems: The first is that its defense doesn't instil confidence. Ghana exposed it, and France could have if they had gone for it instead of choosing to lose with dignity. But the big problem for the Germans is that they are playing against the hosts. We still don't know how much that support will add to a Brazil team that is not overendowed in any department and is missing its captain and its star, but there is no doubt that Felipe Scolari's men will take the field with the desire to beat the Europeans just as they did the Colombians. In general, Brazil's first-half performances have been good, with a lot of energy, but as the time has passed that intensity has decreased. David Luiz has been, up to now, the standard-bearer with his displays and his aggressiveness, and the fans applaud that as if they were also aware of the limitations of a team that is not at the level required by its tradition, at least when it comes to playing good football. Indeed, what is missing from Brazil is football: They do not have creativity in midfield or up front, Hulk gives everything but he is a goal-scorer by trade and Fred so far has not justified his inclusion. Now without Neymar, it is difficult to see who will supply the goals the Barcelona player did and how. We will see how they set up for the game on Tuesday. It will be interesting to see what happens after the first goal, particularly if that goal is scored by Germany and the hosts have to come out and chase the game. Argentina-Netherlands Paradoxically, Holland was the team that created the most chances against their opponents in the 90 minutes, but the only team taken to extra time and penalties. Between the woodwork and Keylor Navas, Costa Rica survived 120 minutes before falling in the penalties. Arjen Robben still makes the difference, but Robin van Persie missed chances, and so the game got more difficult for the Netherlands. Without De Jong, we will have to see how they set up to defend against a team like Argentina, which asks more questions of them both through their attitude and individual abilities. We will have to wait as well to see how much more attacking Argentina will do, knowing that they don't want to be left at the mercy of a team set up for the counterattack like Louis van Gaal's Holland. Getting Ready For Argentina vs. Netherlands: - McIntyre: Argentina's defense rising to occasion - Delaney: Old foes reunite in Argentina vs. Netherlands - McIntyre: Superstars collide in Messi vs. Robben - Cox: Four teams, four key battles - Marcotti: Previewing the World Cup semifinals - World Cup Power Rankings: Germany on top - Ames: Gamesmanship alive and well Against Belgium, the match was opened up very early for Alejandro Sabella's men, thanks to Gonzalo Higuain's excellent technique that resulted in a goal. But against the Netherlands, if the match remains scoreless, it is much more likely that the teams will study each other and, returning to boxing metaphors, neither one will be looking to land the knockout blow knowing it might leave them open to being knocked down themselves. Argentina also looked more defensively solid in the round of 16. It is strange to think they might turn their back on what was so difficult to achieve in search of a more attacking formation that would leave them exposed against the speed of Robben and co. Robin van Persie and Lionel Messi take center stage in the Netherlands-Argentina semifinal. Anyhow, I still think that Argentina is, within the existing parity, the team with the biggest advantage, the best forwards. It is true that they have lost Di Maria, who today is the player who makes the biggest difference after Lionel Messi. It is also true that Sergio Aguero is not 100 percent fit and that Higuain only made his appearance in the fifth game. But in spite of all that, they still have strength in depth and attacking options. As well as having a certain Messi, of course. In such closed games, I repeat that it is those players who have the goal etched between their eyes who should make those small but decisive differences. Finally, I was surprised that Belgium manager Marc Wilmots said that Argentina had not impressed him and that they are a run-of-the-mill team. It would be good to know what his team did to make a better impression in the 82 minutes they had to turn the game around. Just like France, they gave the feeling that they settled for losing by a small margin, when at this stage of the tournament, it is better to take a risk and go all-in, since any defeat is simply that -- a farewell. It's anybody's tournament In short, all four semifinalists could be champions. Not one has clearly dominated, all have won by the smallest margin. Those players who have made a difference, not by coincidence are the tournament's top scorers, yet have left their mark with fleeting appearances, like Messi, Muller, Neymar or even Robben. It is a shame that a World Cup that started with so much excitement should have gradually been deflating, but it is understandable given the great parity in world football. At this point, when each game is all or nothing, do not expect to see anybody taking too many risks. Much less with the heat and the times of the matches, which oblige teams to ration their energy. Once more, it is sure to be certain players at specific moments who make the difference.

TRANSFERS BY LEAGUE All transfers English Premier League Spanish La Liga Italian Serie A German Bundesliga Major League Soccer 22.57 BST: Right folks, that's a wrap for today but we'll be back for more transfer news, rumours and gossip tomorrow. See you then. 22.44 BST: Eduardo da Silva has said goodbye to Shakhtar Donetsk fans with a letter on the club's official website. The former Arsenal striker, who has been linked with a move to Flamengo, wrote: "I have always felt and appreciated your support. From the first minute of my debut you made me feel like one of the Shakhtar family and for this I will always be grateful." 22.30 BST: Meanwhile, former Liverpool player-turned pundit Stan Collymore has had this to say... We just spoke to Wenger here, deal is as good as done with Sanchez! From the horses mouth! @talkSPORT ON AIR LIVE Follow #AFC @SportsYapper - Stan Collymore (@StanCollymore) July 8, 2014 22.19 BST: ALEXIS SANCHEZ UPDATE! More for you now on Alexis Sanchez as AS are reporting that a deal between Barcelona and Arsenal has been done. The Gunners are apparently paying 34.6 million euros plus add-ons for the Chile international's signature, while the paper claims the transfer is to be announced on Wednesday. Watch this space... 22:02 BST: Roma have had a busy few days of late, having wrapped up deals for both Ashley Cole and Salih Ucan, and Xherdan Shaqiri could be next to join the Serie A outfit. According to Sky Sport Italia, the Rome club have begun negotiations with Bayern Munich over the Switzerland international, who is believed to cost in the region of 20 million euros. 21:08 BST: Liverpool are close to completing their next transfer of the summer, if Mais Futebol are to be believed. The Portuguese website claims Benfica midfielder Lazar Markovic has booked a flight to England for Wednesday, when he will sign a contract with the Reds. The Premier League side are apparently set to pay Benfica 25 million euros for the Serbian's services. 20:40 BST: After enjoying a successful spell on loan at Everton last season, Gareth Barry has signed a three-year deal with the club, having left Manchester City last month following the expiry of his contract. "When you are on loan, it is never the same as being a signed player," Barry told the club's official website. "I was really settled last year -- but now I am an official Everton player and it feels really good." 20:33 BST: DONE DEAL! Everton have done their first bit of business of the summer... Gareth Barry has become our first signing of the summer, agreeing a 3-year deal. #Barry #efc pic.twitter.com/OwX48HwRAX - Everton (@Everton) July 8, 2014 20.03 BST: Former Manchester United youngster Joe Dudgeon has signed a new one-year contract with Hull City, the Tigers have announced. Dudgeon, 23, who joined the club from United in 2011, is looking to get his career back on track having been plagued in the past by a knee problem. "This is a fresh start now and I want to show everybody that I still want to be here and I want to play," he said. 19.34 BST: ALEXIS SANCHEZ UPDATE! We've had a fair bit of talk today about a certain Alexis Sanchez, and we've now got another development... According to Sky Sports, Arsenal are very confident of signing the Chile international for around 30 million pounds, with the forward preferring a move to the Gunners over Liverpool or Juventus. If that is not enough for Arsenal fans, Sky Sports also reports that Mathieu Debuchy will join the club from Newcastle within the next 48 hours for around 10 million pounds. 19.15 BST: Talking of done deals, according to Bild, Mario Mandzukic to Atletico Madrid is all but sealed. The German newspaper claims that the Bayern Munich striker is set to sign a five-year deal with the Spanish champions, while the transfer fee is reported to be in the region of 22 million euros. Bild say that Mario #Mandzukic is joining Atlético Madrid for €22m. Good piece of business for both I reckon. http://t.co/pS53ixc5eb - Marcus Christenson (@m_christenson) July 8, 2014 18.45 BST: DONE DEAL! Roma brought in one left-back yesterday in Ashley Cole and have now made room for him by shipping out another in Dodo. The 22-year-old has moved to Inter Milan on a two-year loan at a cost of 1.2 million euros. However, they will likely have to stump up a further 7.8 million euros as the deal includes an obligatory buy-out clause of that amount, which will be activated after Dodo's first game for the club. 18.20 BST: While we're at it, here's the full story on West Ham's signing of Diego Poyet from Charlton Athletic... 18.02 BST: We told you a little earlier that Southampton have snapped up Dusan Tadic from Twente... Well, you can read the full story on Ronald Koeman's first signing as Saints manager right here. 17.30 BST: Tottenham are set to launch another bid to sign Nottingham Forest defender Jamaal Lascelles from Nottingham Forest. The young defender is highly sought after with Forest rejecting a bid of £4 million from West Ham just last week. But Spurs are going to test the Championship club's resolve with a £5 million bid according to the Daily Mail. Forest told the Hammers they weren't selling and we'd imagine they'll tell Spurs the same. 17.25 BST: We'd known about it for a while but it has been announced. Poyet signs for West Ham. Diego, not Gus. PIC: @diegopoyet7 is officially a West Ham United player. http://t.co/FN4BAxQq1X #WelcomeDiego pic.twitter.com/SiQjCYSoQB - West Ham United FC (@whufc_official) July 8, 2014 17.23 BST: Fulham fans would be forgiven for being a tad worried about signing a Greek for a hefty fee. Kostas Mitroglou has hardly set the world alight (albeit he has barely played) since his £12 million move from Olympiakos in January. And now the Mirror claim the Cottagers are about to spend £9.5 million on Bayer Leverkusen defender Kostas Stafylidis. Brace position Fulham fans, brace position... 17.20 BST: Former Manchester City striker Felipe Caicedo is set to join Espanyol according to TalkSport. The Al-Jazira striker is said to want to rescind his contract with the Emirates club before joinging Espanyol on a two year deal. Felipe Caicedo is desperate to join Espanyol and will buy-out his contract with Al-Jazira to make the move happen. 17.13 BST: El Mundo Deportivo claim Esteban Granero's ill-fated stay in West London with QPR is set to end and he is willing to take a huge cut on his wages in order to secure a move. Granero has not settled at all since arriving at Loftus Road and amid interest from Real Sociedad, is willing to take 50% cut in his wages to join. 17.09 BST: West Ham duo Modibo Maiga and Alou Diarra have been left out of the first-team squad which has travelled to France for a pre-season training camp and are set to leave the east London club during the summer. West Ham will be keen to recoup some of the money they forked out for the duo, around £8 million, as they look to bring in several more signings. 17.04 BST: AND IT'S DONE! 25-year-old Tadić signs a four-year deal and joins from Eredivisie side @fctwente. Welcome to #SaintsFC, #SaintDušan! pic.twitter.com/Ac6GfHBgWb - Southampton FC (@SouthamptonFC) July 8, 2014 16.59 BST: Villareal have announced the sale of French striker Jeremy Perbet to Turkish Super Lig newcomers Istanbul Basaksehir for an undisclosed fee. 16.52 BST: ALMOST DONE DEAL! Southampton have signed FC Twente midfielder Dusan Tadic on a four year deal. Just waiting for the official Twitter confirmation because, you know, that's how things are usually done these days! 16.48 BST: QPR are interested in signing Ronaldinho. Really. I am speechless... But after a bit of research, basically this rumour has been made up by somebody somewhere as a joke. Not one report has the original speculation, all citing 'reports suggest.' We can put this out of our mind now. Wow. 16.42 BST: South American journalist Juan Arango weighs in on the Keylor Navas transfer saga. And he is spot on. I strongly doubt that Pep is going to put Manuel Neuer on the bench or Keylor is going to go to Bayern to sit. We'll see. - Juan Arango (@JuanG_Arango) July 8, 2014 16.35 BST: No idea why this causes such excitement but we've got an update on the future of Nicklas Bendtner. Now considering he is widely panned by the media (at least in the UK) for, well, not being all that good, he is wanted by an awful lot of clubs. This time ' a source close to the player', as reported by the BBC, has said his Danish friend will be signing a deal by the end of this week amid interest from England, Spain and Germany. Incredible. 16.29 BST: It looks like Dejan Lovren's move to Liverpool is edging closer and closer as the Daily Express reports Southampton have lined up a replacement in Bruno Ecuele Manga. The Lorient defender would be available for less than £10 million and with the sale of Lovren at around the £25 million mark, Saints will make a tidy profit on this deal. Everton are also supposedly interested. 16.20 BST: Brace yourselves Crystal Palace fans. Jonny Williams, probably more well-known as Joniesta, is being touted for a move from the club. The fan favourite was loaned out when Tony Pulis was appointed last year and it looks like the midfield sensation will have little to no future at Palace if he stays under Pulis. There is just a complete contrast in styles. And that has prompted former Selhurst Park favourite Jonathan Parr to encourage his new club Ipswich, who loaned Joniesta last season, to bring him in on a permanent deal.  Parr said: "I spoke to Jonny Williams, who was here on loan last season of course and he couldn't speak highly enough of the club. Maybe I can get him to join me. I'll give it a go. It could be fun!" 16.13 BST: A rehash from a few days ago I believe but L'Equipe are reporting Monaco are set to bid for Newcastle's Moussa Sissoko. 16.05 BST: They're the only ones running it AGAIN today but Cheshire Today seem to think the Mehdi Benatia deal from Roma to Manchester City is nearing completion for around £30 million. But... didn't we already know that? 16.00 BST: End of story?!? Probably not... Sky Italia are reporting that Juventus have told #MUFC that Arturo Vidal is NOT FOR SALE #JuveNews #ExhaleMyBianconeroFriends - Adam Digby (@Adz77) July 8, 2014 15.54 BST: Sao Paulo have announced the short-term loan of new Orlando City signing Kaka. Click the link and see a gallery of training pics from the Brazilian club's website. Kaká segue rotina intensa de treinos http://t.co/QpYHod7rTh - São Paulo FC (@SaoPauloFC) July 7, 2014 15.45 BST: Rejoice Leeds United fans, there is life after Ross McCormack yet! Chairman Massimo Cellino has announced the signings of goalkeeper Marco Silvestri from Chievo and midfielder Tommaso Bianchi on four and three year deals respectively. 15.41 BST: Cagliari have announced the signing of not one, but TWO Inter Milan players. Defender Simone Benedetti has signed a permanent deal with the club while striker Samuele Longo joins on a one-year loan deal with a view to a permanent transfer. 15.35 BST: It's not often Brits leave these shores for new footballing pastures. But Ashley Cole's move to Roma has clearly inspired others. Gateshead's Josh Walker has taken a huge step out of his comfort zone and has signed for Indian champions Bengaluru in the I-League. I'm not joking. He has been labelled their 'marquee' signing and completes their quota of four foreign players. "I am very excited to start this chapter of my career with the champions of India," Middlesbrough's former England U20 captain told his new club's website. 15.28 BST: Swansea City may have already signed Lukasz Fabianski, Bafetimbi Gomis and Marvin Emnes, but boss Garry Monk has no intention to stop there. With the news the club are close to signing Bosnia midfielder Muhamed Besic, Monk added: "Hopefully I would like to get two or three more in just to add to the quality and the strength of the squad." Should be a fun summer for the Swans fans. 15.22 BST: Remember that year when Fulham got to the UEFA Cup final and lost to Atletico Madrid spearheaded by Diego Forlan and Sergio Aguero? Fulham's right back that season was John Pantsil. And while the manager, Roy Hodgson, is now managing England, the right back has just signed a deal to play for Martizberg United in South Africa. And good luck to him. 15.15 BST: Sunderland and Stoke are set to fight it out for Marseille's Rod Fanni. The big defender could be available for as little as £3 million after Newcastle turned down the opportunity to sign the Frenchman. 15.09 BST: REAL MADRID DEALT UNUSUAL BLOW IN TRANSFER WINDOW! No, seriously! Usually footballers can't wait to profess how they have always supported Real Madrid and it would be a dream to play there etc etc. OK, James Rodriguez has already done that but he has also now professed his loyalty to Monaco by saying in El Mundo Deportivo he wants to stay at the French club. Lets see how long that feeling lasts.  James Rodriguez will be staying put for at least one more year at Monaco. 14.56 BST: Some updates from ESPN FC's own Jonathan Johnson on the Serge Aurier to PSG rumours. Serge Aurier to @footmercato: "I have heard of PSG's interest. They are a very good club, one of Europe's best. They are in the top 8." #PSG - Jonathan Johnson (@Jon_LeGossip) July 8, 2014 Aurier: "It is interesting to know that the club with the means to buy anyone they want are interested in me. I am also Parisian." #PSG #TFC - Jonathan Johnson (@Jon_LeGossip) July 8, 2014 Aurier: "Me being Parisian makes the link stronger. Apart from that, I will let the competent people around me take care of it." #PSG #TFC - Jonathan Johnson (@Jon_LeGossip) July 8, 2014 Aurier: "People said I had already signed an agreement with Arsenal. This is not true. All I can say is that I like EPL the most." #AFC #TFC - Jonathan Johnson (@Jon_LeGossip) July 8, 2014 Aurier: "Playing in England is a dream, but sometimes they do not materialise. If PSG or ASM are keen, I won't ignore that." #PSG #ASM #TFC - Jonathan Johnson (@Jon_LeGossip) July 8, 2014 Aurier: "PSG & ASM can meet my representatives. We will see what happens. What I want is a club where I am guaranteed to play." #PSG #ASM - Jonathan Johnson (@Jon_LeGossip) July 8, 2014 14.51 BST: Wonderfully admirable from Athletic Bilbao but makes the life of a transfer blogger that little more difficult! !!! RT @arkulari Athletic is starting the preseason with 34 players, 29 of them came from the youth sector. Unique. (via @canteraJavi ) - Adam Digby (@Adz77) July 8, 2014 14.50 BST: Everyone else may be leaving Atletico Madrid but Marca have today reported Brazilian centre back Miranda, isn't going anywhere. Relief at last. Miranda: "Don't worry, I'm staying" http://t.co/hnbjTJmShZ pic.twitter.com/x3XpXLh9IC - MARCA in English (@MARCAinENGLISH) July 8, 2014 14.43 BST: DONE DEAL! Apologies for being a bit late to the start with this one but young Botafogo midfielder Octavio has signed for Fiorentina in a one-year loan deal with an option to make the move permanent next summer. 14.40 BST: Highly rated Cagliari central defender Davide Astori could be on his way to Lazio according to Il Tempo. The capital club have agreed a four-year deal with the Italian who will cost £1.2 million. All that remains is the approval of Claudio Lotito, the Lazio president, to finalise the transfer. 14.32 BST: This is funny. Thanks to Sport Witness for clearing this ridiculous rumour up. Yaya Toure to Man Utd? Please. Le Parisien, normally reliable, may have lost their minds a little. They pick PSG as main club in for Yaya, and Man United plus Chelsea. - Sport Witness (@Sport_Witness) July 8, 2014 14.30 BST: The Inter revamp continues as Tuttosport claim the clearing of the old guard will carry on with the sales of Walter Samuel and Esteban Cambiasso who are both headed for Sampdoria. Walter Samuel could be joining compatriot Esteban Cambiasso on his way out of Inter Milan. 14.22 BST: Amid reported interest from Barcelona for the services of former Real Madrid man Gonzalo Higuain, the Argentine has moved to confirm he has no intention of leaving Napoli. Read the full story here. 14.15 BST: Pablo Armero has been in the headlines recently after having a go at Rafa Benitez for not rating him and then for dancing like a pro when Colombia came home from the World Cup in widespread celebration. After linking himself with a move to Arsenal or Liverpool, the Colombian has now been mentioned in the same sentence as Udinese according to tuttoudinese.it. 14.08 BST: Liverpool's Danish defender Daniel Agger is being forced out of the club and touted with a move abroad. The Dane barely featured under Brendan Rodgers last season and was touted for a move to Barcelona but it is thought the Spanish giants have turned down the chance to sign him. El Mundo Deportivo say the Catalan giants have cooled their interest due to the player's recent injury record. 14.00 BST: This could get a touch bitter. Wolfsburg are chasing some big names and were today rejected by Alvaro Morata according to the Spaniard's agent. Juanma Lopez told Kicker, "Wolfsburg are without a chance. Alvaro wants to join Juve. Hopefully, the transfer will be done within the next one or two days." The same report reckons Wolfsburg will now go after Romelu Lukaku or Divock Origi. 13.50 BST: New Galatasaray boss Cesare Prandelli has targeted Sunderland playmaker Emanuele Giaccherini. The Sunderland Echo claim the 29-year-old who only signed for the Mackems last season in a £6 million deal has been targeted by the former Italy manager who is a huge fan of the winger. However the report also suggests Giaccherini is keen to stay at the Stadium of Light after only showing glimpses of his potential. This could be the last time Emanuele Giaccherini celebrates with his Sunderland teammates after interest from Galatasaray has surfaced. 13.42 BST: Ecuador's Enner Valencia has made no secret of using the World Cup as a shop window to tart himself to the big clubs in Europe. And it would appear it has worked after L'Equipe reported clubs from all over the continent are keen. Porto, Sporting Lisbon, Sevilla, Valencia, Fiorentina, Napoli, Tottenham, Everton, West Ham, Newcastle, Augsburg and Hertha are all said to be thinking about an offer. Now, it just needs to come to fruition for the Ecuadorian hitman. 13.36 BST: Porto are no strangers to the South American market and the potential profits it holds. Just ask them about Falcao, James Rodriguez and soon Jackson Martinez. All bought at a pittence and sold for huge fees. So when they go after a player from Club America and he's called Raul Jimenez, we should probably take notice. Well, that is exactly what is happening as they battle it out with Lyon for the £6 million rated Mexican. Probably a safe bet he'll be worth more than £20 million in three years time... 13.30 BST: Despite relegation last year, many would be hard-pressed to argue against David Marshall of Cardiff City being voted goalkeeper of the year. And such form has seen the Scottish international rewarded with interest from Southampton, according to the Daily Mail, who are prepared to bid £8 million in order to secure his services. 13.24 BST: Cheeky cheeky Daniel Levy! The Telegraph claim the Tottenham supremo, who is currently presiding over his favourite time of year, tried to offer Gylfi Sigurdsson in return for Ben Davies and Michel Vorm of Swansea City. But failed. Swansea fancy Davies to be valued at £10 million alone while if Vorm is to be included in any deal, the Lilywhites will have to significantly increase their current bid. 13.14 BST: When I heard West Ham wanted to sign Mathieu Valbuena from Marseille, I have to say I scoffed at the proposition. Well West Ham's ambition shows no signs of abating after Sky Sources claim the Hammers have now made a £12 million bid to sign highly rated Ukranian winger Yehven Konoplyanka. He was wanted and almost signed by Liverpool in January for nearly £20 million. How times change... Sky Sources: West Ham have made a £12m bid for Dnipro star Yevhen Konoplyanka. #whufc - Pete O'Rourke (@SkySportsPeteO) July 8, 2014 13.07 BST: What a shock!!! Rumours about Klaas Jan Huntelaar leaving Schalke for the Premier League appear to be wide of the mark... Or so says Schalke sporting director Horst Heldt who told the club's official website he has received no contact from Liverpool about a move. He said: "Most recently, I've read that Liverpool FC should have interest in Klaas-Jan Huntelaar. Liverpool, Klaas-Jan and also his adviser have not contacted us. And we also have no interest in selling the player." We can almost guarantee that won't be the last we hear of Huntelaar this transfer window. 13.01 BST: Claims from TalkSport suggest Swansea City are closing in on the signing of Bosnia and Herzegovina midfielder Muhamed Besic from Ferencvaros. Their £4 million offer has reportedly been accepted and a three-year deal is soon to be signed. 12.55 BST: Newcastle are acting quickly to replace outgoing full back Mathieu Debuchy and have made a £5 million bid for Juventus defender Mauricio Isla according to Tuttosport. 12.48 BST: Tottenham and Manchester United's hopes of signing Memphis Depay took a blow today after PSV manager Philip Cocu told Voetbal International the player should remain in Holland for one more season. He said: ""I let Memphis know that it would good for him to have another year here. He has only one full season behind him. I think you need a certain foundation before making the next step. That is independent of the qualities that a person has. Therefore, he must stay at PSV at least one more year." 12.43 BST: PSG have long been advised (not officially) by many a journalist to stop going after the big name defenders and just sign Serge Aurier on a cheaper deal from Toulouse. Well it appears Laurent Blanc has come to his senses and has even called the Ivorian to persuade him to join the champions. Toulouse have an offer from Monaco to consider as wall but are hoping to sell the defender abroad. PSG are chasing highly-rated and available-cheap Toulouse defender Serge Aurier. 12.36 BST: Chelsea's ongoing battle with Atletico Madrid to sign Filipe Luis 'on the cheap' looks set to continue. Atleti may be resigned to losing their left-back but they won't let him go for a penny less than his £19 million release clause. And yet a report in the Metro claims Chelsea have upped their bid to just about £15 million. Someone at Chelsea needs to check their maths because as far as I can work out, that is still £4 million less than the asking price. Looks like this one is going to rumble on. 12.30 BST: Arsenal's long term target Lars Bender is subject to more interest from the Gunners as they seek a defensive midfielder. Bayer Leverkusen are reluctant to sell after tying the German international down to a long-term contract but the Daily Mail claim a bid will be forthcoming. The report also says if Arsene Wenger does not land his number 1 target he will go for either Morgan Schneiderlin of Southampton or Real Madrid's Sami Khedira. 12.23 BST: Marseille have stepped up their interest in this blog's favourite club (it's not, it's just they're keeping us very busy) Atletico Madrid's Javi Manquillo according to AS. The French club are set to beat the likes of Betis, Getafe and Elche to the full-back's signature as a £2 million deal is thrashed out. 12.17 BST: Read the full story here on Alexis Sanchez opting NOT to join Liverpool. 12.12 BST: Middlesborough's search for a new striker continues in the Belgian league. It may take a little longer to conclude though! Belgian striker Jelle Vossen wants to join Middlesbrough, after Genk rejected a bid. #boro - Kristof Terreur (@HLNinEngeland) July 8, 2014 12.08 BST: A blow for Liverpool, Spurs and Everton as TalkSport say Granada have begun talks with Porto about the sale of star man Yacine Brahimi. The Algerian won many admirers at the World Cup and it is said a £6.5 million fee can lure him away from La Liga. And it looks like the Portuguese giants are leading the chase. 11.59 BST: Chelsea's pursuit of Marcos Rojo has apparently made big news in Portugal, or so say Sport Witness. The Blues will be desperate for a replacement to fill the rather large void at left back, vacated by a certain Ashley Cole. 11.52 BST: Lyon have announced Guinea striker Mohammed Yattara has signed a two-year deal to keep him at the club following a successful loan spell with Troyes last season. 11.46 BST: Two updates from Gianluca Di Marzio on Inter Milan's transfer activity. First, Real Madrid, who had been happy to loan Casemiro have now asked for £12 million which Inter have stepped away from. It is too much for them but are hoping to remain negotiation for the player. And secondly Inter are very close to signing Gary Medel from Cardiff City for around £10 million. 11.40 BST: Everybody's favourite goalkeeper from the World Cup Guillermo Ochoa wants to stay in France. Doesn't seem to want to given the rejected contract offers. #MEX goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa has rejected two offers from Ligue 1 clubs (Bastia + 1 other) - agent reaffirms priority to remain in France - Mohammed Ali (@mohammedali_93) July 8, 2014 Ochoa's agent tells Europe 1 that his client will seek other European clubs if a move to a top Ligue 1 club fails this summer #MEX - Mohammed Ali (@mohammedali_93) July 8, 2014 11.36 BST: Firstly, decent signing by Aberdeen getting David Goodwillie in. Secondly, great banter from the Dons too. Striker joins the Dons pic.twitter.com/cozUQ6OsYB - Aberdeen FC (@AberdeenFC)  July 7, 2014 We promise he really is delighted to be signing for the Dons! pic.twitter.com/BoLdeWU0aZ - Aberdeen FC (@AberdeenFC) July 7, 2014 11.31 BST: Oh wow! Probably the transfer story of the day! Celtic could be in the running to sign 39-year-old Alessandro Del Piero on a free transfer. The Italian legend almost signed for the Bhoys two years ago and having seen his contract at Sydney FC run out has asked Ronny Deila to give him a call according to the Scottish Sun. Speaking to the paper he said: "Two years ago it was interesting and it would be interesting again. If we could talk then great. If you want I'll give you my phone number and you can pass it on! Celtic are a great team and I have always enjoyed playing in Scotland, so who knows? I know the league has changed with Rangers not being there, but they will be back soon enough. Celtic are also a club that could be in the group stage of the Champions League which is good. Sometimes to get there you just need a little bit of luck. Or experience." Look how happy Del Piero is about the possibility of going to Scotland! It is on the cards... Watch. This. Space. 11.28 BST: Who knew just how powerful Twitter would become. It is now being used by Lucas Leiva to wrangle himself a move from Liverpool to Napoli. The Brazilian has removed that he is a Liverpool player from his profile and UNFOLLOWED the Reds' official Twitter account. Put your claws away a Lucas! Napoli are said to be interested in the player with Liverpool looking at a possible loan deal. 11.23 BST: Respected journalist Graham Hunter tweeted a few things yesterday regarding Angel Di Maria's proposed move from Real Madrid. Here is his take on the saga. Ok, to clarify. I understand that #DiMaria is in huge demand. I believe RM willing to sell him for big fee to fund their further adventures - Graham Hunter (@BumperGraham) July 7, 2014 Personally I think they'd be mad to sell #DiMaria AND I think it'll be very hard to persuade Monaco to sell JR - Graham Hunter (@BumperGraham) July 7, 2014 However IF #DiMaria goes #Utd have a strong chance of getting him. But there's a queue. Perfect player for LVG though. I'd miss him in Liga - Graham Hunter (@BumperGraham) July 7, 2014 11.20 BST: Read the full story on Willy Caballero's move to Manchester City now. Also for your pre-lunch perusal, Lottar Matthaus tells reporters that Toni Kroos is the right fit for Real Madrid and that Bayern Munich will miss him. Read it here. 11.14 BST: Well summed up by ESPN's own Alex Shaw... Oof. Barcelona's Gerard Deulofeu: "I'd rather play for @stokecity than Real Madrid." http://t.co/rQxWXN2rmj - Alex Shaw (@AlexShawESPN) July 8, 2014 11.09 BST: Manchester United are being far more tactful this summer than last. A report in the Daily Star has suggested Utd officials are going to go directly to Mats Hummels' representatives to see if the German is interested in a move before publicly hounding Borussia Dortmund about a transfer. Given the embarrassment had at the hands of Cesc Fabregas and Ander Herrera (last summer) I'm sure Ed Woodward doesn't want a repeat performance this year. 11.05 BST: LUIS SUAREZ UPDATE! There is going to be a delay unfortunately. Liverpool are not happy at losing out on signing Alexis Sanchez and are taking it out on Barcelona. Not entirely fair given it was Sanchez' and not Barca's decision that the Chilean would not go to Anfield. Anyway, according to a report in the Independent, Liverpool are so bitter they have decided they want £75 million for their Uruguayan shoulder-muncher and not the £63 million being mooted as the agreed fee a few days ago.  Does anyone actually know what Suarez' release fee actually is? 11.00 BST: More from the Spanish champions Atletico as they chase Alessio Cerci from Torino. Reports yesterday suggested the Italian's agent was in Madrid to discuss a deal but Atleti apparently don't want to pay more than £15 million despite the attacker's £20 million valuation. 10.51 BST: Brutal Silvio Berlusconi has told new boss Pippo Inzaghi he must sell before he buys. Deals for Torino's Alessio Cerci and Genoa's Sime Vrsaljko are said to be all but finalised but the Milan supremo has told his manager and Adriano Galliani, the club must sell to buy. According to Gazzetto dello Sport, a meeting between the three at Berlusconi's house saw the former Italian president tell Inzaghi he must sell Alessandro Matri, M'Baye Niang and Robinho before any deals can go through. 10.45​ BST: Ageing full-backs are all the rage in Italy. First Roma revive Maicon's flailing career. Then Ashley Cole signs for the capital club yesterday. And now reports from Gazzetto dello Sport and Tuttosport claim Juventus are close to signing Manchester United veteran Patrice Evra. Apparently Evra's representatives are due in London today to speak to United officials to persuade them to allow him to move despite penning a one-year deal at Old Trafford just a few months ago. The Frenchman is said to want the move so he is guaranteed first-team football with a Champions League club, two things United can't offer given the signing of Luke Shaw. 10.40​ BST: Arsenal target Federico Marchetti has seen interest from AC Milan rise in the past few days. The Lazio goalkeeper is said to be close to joining The Rossoneri in a £7.5 million deal to be paid in three installments according to Il Messagero. 10.37 BST: Joe Hart must be starting to sweat. Willy Caballero signs from Malaga. NEW SIGNING: We are delighted to announce the signing of @willy_caballero. Full story: http://t.co/RmBdMDC0dE #mcfc pic.twitter.com/8ZPnG3GA03 - Manchester City FC (@MCFC) July 8, 2014 10.35 BST: Looks like Southampton might be losing another one of their stars. And Morgan Schneiderlin will be spoiled for choice as to where he goes. Lucky boy. L'Equipe say Arsenal, Tottenham, Dortmund and Napoli are all in for Morgan Schneiderlin. - Sport Witness (@Sport_Witness) July 8, 2014 10.30 BST: Arsenal fans jump for joy, I tell you, jump! Alexis Sanchez has agreed to join the club according to tuttomercatoweb. Barcelona and Arsenal have apparently agreed a fee too. It's all done! Except, obviously, the announcement and the fact this is clearly just a rumour. Still a lot of interest from Juventus. 10.26 BST: This whole Arturo Vidal thing is getting rather confusing. In a nutshell, there have been reports he wants to go but Juventus don't want to sell. There have been reports he doesn't want to go but Juve do want to sell. There have been reports Manchester United have offered huge pots of gold which Juve have turned away but are open to negotiationg. And most recently there were reports Vidal was enquired about by Utd some weeks ago but there has been nothing since. Confused? Yes I am too. No Arturo, we don't really know what is going on with your future either. Well the latest report from the Metro seems to think Manchester United have ploughed on with negotiations with Vidal's agent behind Juventus' back even though the Gazzetto Dello Sport reported the Bianconeri told Utd, hands off. It's like a soap opera. 10.20 BST: Mark Hughes is an ambitious man and fair play to him for that but trying to sign Eduardo may have been an ambition too far. According to a report in the Stoke Sentinel, the former Arsenal and Shakhtar Donetsk striker is set to join Brazilian side Flamengo on an 18-month deal. 10.16 BST: Another frustrated Chelsea youngster with a supposedly big future is Bertrand Traore. The Burkina Faso international spent last season on loan at Vitesse Arnhem and is set to return to the Dutch club as Chelsea have no room for him in their first team. Chelsea have now loaned seven players to Vitesse in the last 12 months: Traore, Wallace, Lucas Piazon, Patrick van Aanholt, Christian Atsu, Gael Kakuta and Sam Hutchinson. 10.11 BST: Tottenham are set to make an ambitious raid on Chelsea for £20 million striker Romelu Lukaku. The Belgian has told the club he wants to leave on a permanent deal and the Metro claim Spurs are seriously considering weighing up a bid. However, given the clubs' fractious relationship and Lukaku's desire to play in the Champions League, this one might not be as much of a goer as is being suggested. Romelu Lukaku has demanded a transfer from Chelsea and claims he wants to play for a Champions League club, putting half of Europe on alert in the process. 10.06 BST: After an excellent World Cup for the United States Men's National Team (official name) defender Matt Besler has attracted interest from around Europe. And according to Kicker, Bundesliga club Freiburg are very interested in signing the defender from Sporting Kansas City in the MLS. 10.01 BST: I told you there would be loads of Atleti news coming up. First Benfica goalkeeper Jan Oblak is close to signing after performing a no-show at Benfica's pre-season training. AS say a £16 million deal is close to being finalised. The same paper also claim Atleti will tie up a deal for Mario Mandzukic of Bayern after baulking at the £30 million asking price set for Alvaro Negredo at Manchester City. And it is not over yet. Atleti have also offered £25 million plus Leo Baptistao for Verona's Juan Iturbe who had been close to signing for Juventus just last week. The AS back pages working over-time. 9.57 BST:  Alvaro Morata is close to a move to Juventus from Real Madrid according to AS.  9.52 BST: There'll be plenty more Atletico Madrid updates this week with players expected to be coming and going. One such player we haven't heard much from is Christian Rodriguez. He spoke to El Pais in Uruguay and said, "Today what I want is to play. I was Liga champion and a finalist in the Champions League, but when you do not play, the taste is different. I feel that this trophy was not as deserved as I did not play." 9.46 BST: It's going on in Germany. Freiburg sporting director Klemens Hartenbach says "there are situations in which things can happen that have previously been ruled out," according to an interview in Badische Zeitung. Firstly, Borussia Dortmund have made one final offer for Matthias Ginter. And Freiburg are talking to Benfica's Stefan Mitrovic over a deal to replace the outgoing Ginter. 9.41 BST: Just because this is an incredible fact. Ross McCormack is now the 8th most expensive British striker in history behind Carroll, Rooney, Bent, Shearer, Fletcher, Sturridge & Fowler. - Andrew Haigh (@AndrewHaigh) July 8, 2014 9.40 BST: DONE DEAL! It has finally happened. The fee may be undisclosed but it is widely being reported as in the £10 million region. OFFICIAL: @Rossmccormack44 signs for Fulham. Welcome to the Club, Ross! http://t.co/wC0ta0jVwh #FFC pic.twitter.com/2IJGMFD6XR - Fulham Football Club (@FulhamFC) July 8, 2014 9.38 BST: In not quite so high profile Bayern Munich news, reserve goalkeeper Lukas Raeder has left the club on a free. According to TZ, he is set to join Vitoria Setubal in Portugal. 9.35 BST: It is getting to crunch-time for the Toni Kroos transfer to Real Madrid. According to TZ, Bayern Munich have withdrawn their contract offer to the midfielder who wanted to earn the same amount as Philip Lahm and Thomas Muller, believed to be around the £10 million mark. Claims in Spain clearly suggest the deal with Los Blancos is all but done with the Spanish giants offering him huge wages. Kroos wages at Real Madrid agreed at €12m, same as Gotze is on at Bayern. German club wanted to pay less than €7m. [Bild] - Sport Witness (@Sport_Witness) July 8, 2014 9.30 BST: Former Newcastle man Luuk de Jong, who might have been holding out hopes of a permanent deal with the Magpies following his loan and to join his brother Siem at St James' Park, is still set to leave Borussia Munchengladbach. But not for the bright lights of the north-east of England. According to Bild, he will sign a deal with PSV Eindhoven today with the fee believed to be somewhere between £5 million and £6 million. 9.24 BST: A quick update from Germany now as our man Stephan Uersfeld has told us Hertha Berlin and AZ Alkmaar are in a dispute over midfielder Roby Beerens. Hertha are unwilling to pay over £1.5 million while Alkmaar claim that is not enough for their man. Sporting director Michael Preetz told Kicker the Dutch club need to make a decision this week of "Otherwise, we will look elsewhere." He also confirmed the German club would not be signing Askhan Dejagah because he is too expensive. Askhan Dejagah won't be returning 'home' any time soon according to Hertha Berlin because he is too expensive. 9.21 BST: Almost two done deals for Inter Milan with our man in Italy, Ben Gladwell, reporting Yann M'Vila of Rubin Kazan and Dodo of Roma are set to join on one-year loan deals. The announcements are expected later today. 9.17 BST: Fiorentina just can't seem to catch a break at the moment. They're being pillaged for Juan Cuadrado but don't want to sell and now Alberto Aquilani's agent has told the press that talks over a new contract are on ice. Bad times to be a Viola fan... 9.10 BST: And finally our updates from Ian Holyman end with the news Olympiakos love French football. Or so it would seem. They've already signed Eric Abidal from Monaco and have decided to sign former teammate Delvin Ndinga from the French giants on a three-year deal following a successful loan spell last season. But it does not end there, oh no, with the news Mathieu Dossevi of Valenciennes has also joined the Greek Champions, as announced on his Twitter account (I am Greek and this roughly translates as " I am extremely happy that I am an Olympiakos player"). eimai poly xaroumenos pou eimai pektes apo olympiakos... #sorryforthemistakes #lol #olympiacos #newstart #athens #happiness #proud - Matthieu Dossevi (@MDossevi) July 7, 2014 You'd think that was enough but no, according to footmercato.net, Dossevi will be joined by teammate Arthur Masuaku in Piraeus too.  9.07 BST: In case you were asleep or doing something more interesting with your Monday evening, Manchester City announced the loaning out of promising young midfielder Marcos Lopes to Lille on a one-year deal. If you don't speak French, we promise this translates as "he's joined"... or thereabouts. À noter que @Rony10Lopes ne rejoindra le groupe qu'après l'Euro U19 (du 19 au 31/07) auquel il s'apprête à participer pic.twitter.com/pgdGxeO4Ho - LOSC (@losclive) July 7, 2014 9.05 BST: Marseille may be about to lose talisman Mathieu Valbuena to La Liga but what they'll lose in goals they're hoping to shore up in defence. The French giants are looking to bring in Norwegian international Vegard Forren from Molde. Marseille are looking at Norwegian international Vegard Forren as they seek to stiffen their defence. 9.00 BST: Our man in France Ian Holyman has updated us on a few of the rumours flying around across the Channel. And first of his nuggets is that Monaco are interested in CSKA Sofia prodigy Ivaylo Chochev, 21, who is also being pursued by Palermo of Serie A. 8.19 BST: A-League side Brisbane Roar have beefed up their squad, announcing two new signings today. Jamie Young returns to Queensland after plying his trade in the lower leagues of the UK for more than a decade, while Daniel Bowles his signed from fellow A-League club Adelaide United. Later Chelsea Hot on the heels of the Ashley Cole to Roma news -- which involves a 113,000 pounds-a-week pay cut, according to Tuesday's Sun -- the Daily Mail says another Chelsea pensioner could be about to join him. Samuel Eto'o has lucrative offers from China and Turkey to consider, but he'd rather keep things interesting and return to Italy, where he has already spent two fruitful years with Inter Milan. What's more, he's willing to follow Cole's lead and lower his salary to a mere 3 million pounds to push things through. How might that affect another Chelsea striker? Maybe not much. The Mirror says that Romelu Lukaku won't stomach another season on loan and instead wants to be playing Champions League football for a club at which he is permanently under contract. Who's Man City keeping? Joe Hart might have to set his sights elsewhere soon. Willy Caballero, the Argentinian goalkeeper, has touched down for a medical at Manchester City. The Manchester Evening News has pictures of him, well, walking, while the Guardian notes that Cabellero was signed by Manuel Pellegrini from Malaga and will not have arrived at the Etihad to be an also-ran. Any false moves of the type that let Costel Pantilimon in this past season, and Hart might face a far sterner task in getting his place back. Caballero was first linked with City a year ago -- slightly predictably, or so it seemed -- and now Pellegrini seems to have gotten his man. Do you play football? Then Arsenal wants you Arsenal, whose will-they-won't-they sagas make them firm favourites of any self-respecting transfer blog, seem about to move disappointingly early this time out, with the Guardian on the case again and reporting that their fee for Newcastle's Mathieu Debuchy will be a very precise 7.9 million pounds. That one should go through pretty quickly -- Debuchy is even breaking his holiday to see this through, which always sounds a more dramatic step than it is. The fun might not end there; a loan move for Costa Rica sensation Joel Campbell might water that fee down a little. Carl Jenkinson won't be used as part of the deal, though -- the same article says Newcastle have been offered one-time footballer Micah Richards to fill their right-back void but would rather plump for Daryl Janmaat or Ricardo van Rhijn. With the price looking right and both sides keen on a move, it seems Mathieu Debuchy to Arsenal from Newcastle is almost a done deal. And the Gunners might be in business again very soon indeed. Their pursuit of Alexis Sanchez is not exactly hot off the press, but more recent news is that things might get a little more straightforward now. The Liverpool Echo says Sanchez has been swayed by the capital's bright lights, and Brendan Rodgers' side is resigned to seeing him at Emirates Stadium next season. There's yet more -- kind of. Arsenal are among those that have been linked with Fiorentina and Colombia wide man Juan Cuadrado, but his club insist they are yet to receive any offers. However, their sporting director, Daniele Prade, doesn't sound overly optimistic about keeping his man and said in Tuttosport that, "We will do our best to make him stay with us". Atleti like Alex Witsel They might not quite have lived up to their billing at the World Cup, but Belgians still seem to be all the rage. Marca claims that Atletico Madrid are courting Axel Witsel, the midfield dynamo whose last action in Brazil was to volley a late half-chance over the bar against Argentina. It says Atleti would like him to complete their lineup in the centre of the park for next term -- and that they're in for his Zenit teammate, left-sided Argentinian player Cristian Ansaldi too. The prognosis? Mixed: Witsel cost Zenit 40 million euros and would not come cheaply this time either, while Ansaldi is said to be settled in Russia and would not be receptive to a proposed loan. Neymar who? In a parallel dimension, Neymar's back injury doesn't matter all that much to Brazil. Stepping in is one-time wunderkind Alexandre Pato, still just 24, and he slaloms past Per Mertesacker and Mats Hummels at will to remind the Brasileiros that he can be their darling too. In this particular time and place, though, Pato's career has hit the skids; he isn't in the World Cup squad and can be found whiling away his time agonisingly near to the action as a player with Sao Paolo. But is the ex-Milan forward's star back on the rise? Corriere Dello Sport says he is dreaming of a return to Italy -- and there is a chance he might get his wish, with former enemies Inter apparently sniffing around.	sports

The Gunners are apparently paying 34.6 million euros plus add-ons for the Chile international's signature, while the paper claims the transfer is to be announced on Wednesday. Watch this space... 22:02 BST: Roma have had a busy few days of late, having wrapped up deals for both Ashley Cole and Salih Ucan, and Xherdan Shaqiri could be next to join the Serie A outfit. According to Sky Sport Italia, the Rome club have begun negotiations with Bayern Munich over the Switzerland international, who is believed to cost in the region of 20 million euros. 21:08 BST: Liverpool are close to completing their next transfer of the summer, if Mais Futebol are to be believed. The Portuguese website claims Benfica midfielder Lazar Markovic has booked a flight to England for Wednesday, when he will sign a contract with the Reds. The Premier League side are apparently set to pay Benfica 25 million euros for the Serbian's services. 20:40 BST: After enjoying a successful spell on loan at Everton last season, Gareth Barry has signed a three-year deal with the club, having left Manchester City last month following the expiry of his contract. "When you are on loan, it is never the same as being a signed player," Barry told the club's official website.

"This is a fresh start now and I want to show everybody that I still want to be here and I want to play," he said. 19.34 BST: ALEXIS SANCHEZ UPDATE! We've had a fair bit of talk today about a certain Alexis Sanchez, and we've now got another development... According to Sky Sports, Arsenal are very confident of signing the Chile international for around 30 million pounds, with the forward preferring a move to the Gunners over Liverpool or Juventus. If that is not enough for Arsenal fans, Sky Sports also reports that Mathieu Debuchy will join the club from Newcastle within the next 48 hours for around 10 million pounds. 19.15 BST: Talking of done deals, according to Bild, Mario Mandzukic to Atletico Madrid is all but sealed. The German newspaper claims that the Bayern Munich striker is set to sign a five-year deal with the Spanish champions, while the transfer fee is reported to be in the region of 22 million euros. Bild say that Mario #Mandzukic is joining Atlético Madrid for €22m. Good piece of business for both I reckon. http://t.co/pS53ixc5eb - Marcus Christenson (@m_christenson) July 8, 2014 18.45 BST: DONE DEAL! Roma brought in one left-back yesterday in Ashley Cole and have now made room for him by shipping out another in Dodo. The 22-year-old has moved to Inter Milan on a two-year loan at a cost of 1.2 million euros. However, they will likely have to stump up a further 7.8 million euros as the deal includes an obligatory buy-out clause of that amount, which will be activated after Dodo's first game for the club. 18.20 BST: While we're at it, here's the full story on West Ham's signing of Diego Poyet from Charlton Athletic... 18.02 BST: We told you a little earlier that Southampton have snapped up Dusan Tadic from Twente... Well, you can read the full story on Ronald Koeman's first signing as Saints manager right here. 17.30 BST: Tottenham are set to launch another bid to sign Nottingham Forest defender Jamaal Lascelles from Nottingham Forest. The young defender is highly sought after with Forest rejecting a bid of £4 million from West Ham just last week. But Spurs are going to test the Championship club's resolve with a £5 million bid according to the Daily Mail. Forest told the Hammers they weren't selling and we'd imagine they'll tell Spurs the same. 17.25 BST: We'd known about it for a while but it has been announced. Poyet signs for West Ham. Diego, not Gus. PIC: @diegopoyet7 is officially a West Ham United player. http://t.co/FN4BAxQq1X #WelcomeDiego pic.twitter.com/SiQjCYSoQB - West Ham United FC (@whufc_official) July 8, 2014 17.23 BST: Fulham fans would be forgiven for being a tad worried about signing a Greek for a hefty fee. Kostas Mitroglou has hardly set the world alight (albeit he has barely played) since his £12 million move from Olympiakos in January. And now the Mirror claim the Cottagers are about to spend £9.5 million on Bayer Leverkusen defender Kostas Stafylidis. Brace position Fulham fans, brace position... 17.20 BST: Former Manchester City striker Felipe Caicedo is set to join Espanyol according to TalkSport. The Al-Jazira striker is said to want to rescind his contract with the Emirates club before joinging Espanyol on a two year deal. Felipe Caicedo is desperate to join Espanyol and will buy-out his contract with Al-Jazira to make the move happen. 17.13 BST: El Mundo Deportivo claim Esteban Granero's ill-fated stay in West London with QPR is set to end and he is willing to take a huge cut on his wages in order to secure a move.

Welcome to #SaintsFC, #SaintDušan! pic.twitter.com/Ac6GfHBgWb - Southampton FC (@SouthamptonFC) July 8, 2014 16.59 BST: Villareal have announced the sale of French striker Jeremy Perbet to Turkish Super Lig newcomers Istanbul Basaksehir for an undisclosed fee. 16.52 BST: ALMOST DONE DEAL! Southampton have signed FC Twente midfielder Dusan Tadic on a four year deal. Just waiting for the official Twitter confirmation because, you know, that's how things are usually done these days! 16.48 BST: QPR are interested in signing Ronaldinho. Really. I am speechless... But after a bit of research, basically this rumour has been made up by somebody somewhere as a joke. Not one report has the original speculation, all citing 'reports suggest.' We can put this out of our mind now. Wow. 16.42 BST: South American journalist Juan Arango weighs in on the Keylor Navas transfer saga. And he is spot on. I strongly doubt that Pep is going to put Manuel Neuer on the bench or Keylor is going to go to Bayern to sit. We'll see. - Juan Arango (@JuanG_Arango) July 8, 2014 16.35 BST: No idea why this causes such excitement but we've got an update on the future of Nicklas Bendtner. Now considering he is widely panned by the media (at least in the UK) for, well, not being all that good, he is wanted by an awful lot of clubs. This time ' a source close to the player', as reported by the BBC, has said his Danish friend will be signing a deal by the end of this week amid interest from England, Spain and Germany. Incredible. 16.29 BST: It looks like Dejan Lovren's move to Liverpool is edging closer and closer as the Daily Express reports Southampton have lined up a replacement in Bruno Ecuele Manga. The Lorient defender would be available for less than £10 million and with the sale of Lovren at around the £25 million mark, Saints will make a tidy profit on this deal. Everton are also supposedly interested. 16.20 BST: Brace yourselves Crystal Palace fans. Jonny Williams, probably more well-known as Joniesta, is being touted for a move from the club. The fan favourite was loaned out when Tony Pulis was appointed last year and it looks like the midfield sensation will have little to no future at Palace if he stays under Pulis. There is just a complete contrast in styles. And that has prompted former Selhurst Park favourite Jonathan Parr to encourage his new club Ipswich, who loaned Joniesta last season, to bring him in on a permanent deal.  Parr said: "I spoke to Jonny Williams, who was here on loan last season of course and he couldn't speak highly enough of the club. Maybe I can get him to join me. I'll give it a go. It could be fun!" 16.13 BST: A rehash from a few days ago I believe but L'Equipe are reporting Monaco are set to bid for Newcastle's Moussa Sissoko. 16.05 BST: They're the only ones running it AGAIN today but Cheshire Today seem to think the Mehdi Benatia deal from Roma to Manchester City is nearing completion for around £30 million. But... didn't we already know that? 16.00 BST: End of story?!? Probably not... Sky Italia are reporting that Juventus have told #MUFC that Arturo Vidal is NOT FOR SALE #JuveNews #ExhaleMyBianconeroFriends - Adam Digby (@Adz77) July 8, 2014 15.54 BST: Sao Paulo have announced the short-term loan of new Orlando City signing Kaka. Click the link and see a gallery of training pics from the Brazilian club's website. Kaká segue rotina intensa de treinos http://t.co/QpYHod7rTh - São Paulo FC (@SaoPauloFC) July 7, 2014 15.45 BST: Rejoice Leeds United fans, there is life after Ross McCormack yet! Chairman Massimo Cellino has announced the signings of goalkeeper Marco Silvestri from Chievo and midfielder Tommaso Bianchi on four and three year deals respectively. 15.41 BST: Cagliari have announced the signing of not one, but TWO Inter Milan players. Defender Simone Benedetti has signed a permanent deal with the club while striker Samuele Longo joins on a one-year loan deal with a view to a permanent transfer. 15.35 BST: It's not often Brits leave these shores for new footballing pastures. But Ashley Cole's move to Roma has clearly inspired others. Gateshead's Josh Walker has taken a huge step out of his comfort zone and has signed for Indian champions Bengaluru in the I-League. I'm not joking. He has been labelled their 'marquee' signing and completes their quota of four foreign players. "I am very excited to start this chapter of my career with the champions of India," Middlesbrough's former England U20 captain told his new club's website. 15.28 BST: Swansea City may have already signed Lukasz Fabianski, Bafetimbi Gomis and Marvin Emnes, but boss Garry Monk has no intention to stop there. With the news the club are close to signing Bosnia midfielder Muhamed Besic, Monk added: "Hopefully I would like to get two or three more in just to add to the quality and the strength of the squad." Should be a fun summer for the Swans fans. 15.22 BST: Remember that year when Fulham got to the UEFA Cup final and lost to Atletico Madrid spearheaded by Diego Forlan and Sergio Aguero? Fulham's right back that season was John Pantsil. And while the manager, Roy Hodgson, is now managing England, the right back has just signed a deal to play for Martizberg United in South Africa. And good luck to him. 15.15 BST: Sunderland and Stoke are set to fight it out for Marseille's Rod Fanni. The big defender could be available for as little as £3 million after Newcastle turned down the opportunity to sign the Frenchman. 15.09 BST: REAL MADRID DEALT UNUSUAL BLOW IN TRANSFER WINDOW! No, seriously! Usually footballers can't wait to profess how they have always supported Real Madrid and it would be a dream to play there etc etc. OK, James Rodriguez has already done that but he has also now professed his loyalty to Monaco by saying in El Mundo Deportivo he wants to stay at the French club. Lets see how long that feeling lasts.  James Rodriguez will be staying put for at least one more year at Monaco. 14.56 BST: Some updates from ESPN FC's own Jonathan Johnson on the Serge Aurier to PSG rumours. Serge Aurier to @footmercato: "I have heard of PSG's interest. They are a very good club, one of Europe's best. They are in the top 8." #PSG - Jonathan Johnson (@Jon_LeGossip) July 8, 2014 Aurier: "It is interesting to know that the club with the means to buy anyone they want are interested in me.

Apologies for being a bit late to the start with this one but young Botafogo midfielder Octavio has signed for Fiorentina in a one-year loan deal with an option to make the move permanent next summer. 14.40 BST: Highly rated Cagliari central defender Davide Astori could be on his way to Lazio according to Il Tempo. The capital club have agreed a four-year deal with the Italian who will cost £1.2 million. All that remains is the approval of Claudio Lotito, the Lazio president, to finalise the transfer. 14.32 BST: This is funny. Thanks to Sport Witness for clearing this ridiculous rumour up. Yaya Toure to Man Utd? Please. Le Parisien, normally reliable, may have lost their minds a little. They pick PSG as main club in for Yaya, and Man United plus Chelsea. - Sport Witness (@Sport_Witness) July 8, 2014 14.30 BST: The Inter revamp continues as Tuttosport claim the clearing of the old guard will carry on with the sales of Walter Samuel and Esteban Cambiasso who are both headed for Sampdoria. Walter Samuel could be joining compatriot Esteban Cambiasso on his way out of Inter Milan. 14.22 BST: Amid reported interest from Barcelona for the services of former Real Madrid man Gonzalo Higuain, the Argentine has moved to confirm he has no intention of leaving Napoli. Read the full story here. 14.15 BST: Pablo Armero has been in the headlines recently after having a go at Rafa Benitez for not rating him and then for dancing like a pro when Colombia came home from the World Cup in widespread celebration. After linking himself with a move to Arsenal or Liverpool, the Colombian has now been mentioned in the same sentence as Udinese according to tuttoudinese.it. 14.08 BST: Liverpool's Danish defender Daniel Agger is being forced out of the club and touted with a move abroad. The Dane barely featured under Brendan Rodgers last season and was touted for a move to Barcelona but it is thought the Spanish giants have turned down the chance to sign him. El Mundo Deportivo say the Catalan giants have cooled their interest due to the player's recent injury record. 14.00 BST: This could get a touch bitter. Wolfsburg are chasing some big names and were today rejected by Alvaro Morata according to the Spaniard's agent. Juanma Lopez told Kicker, "Wolfsburg are without a chance. Alvaro wants to join Juve. Hopefully, the transfer will be done within the next one or two days." The same report reckons Wolfsburg will now go after Romelu Lukaku or Divock Origi. 13.50 BST: New Galatasaray boss Cesare Prandelli has targeted Sunderland playmaker Emanuele Giaccherini. The Sunderland Echo claim the 29-year-old who only signed for the Mackems last season in a £6 million deal has been targeted by the former Italy manager who is a huge fan of the winger. However the report also suggests Giaccherini is keen to stay at the Stadium of Light after only showing glimpses of his potential. This could be the last time Emanuele Giaccherini celebrates with his Sunderland teammates after interest from Galatasaray has surfaced. 13.42 BST: Ecuador's Enner Valencia has made no secret of using the World Cup as a shop window to tart himself to the big clubs in Europe. And it would appear it has worked after L'Equipe reported clubs from all over the continent are keen. Porto, Sporting Lisbon, Sevilla, Valencia, Fiorentina, Napoli, Tottenham, Everton, West Ham, Newcastle, Augsburg and Hertha are all said to be thinking about an offer. Now, it just needs to come to fruition for the Ecuadorian hitman. 13.36 BST: Porto are no strangers to the South American market and the potential profits it holds. Just ask them about Falcao, James Rodriguez and soon Jackson Martinez. All bought at a pittence and sold for huge fees. So when they go after a player from Club America and he's called Raul Jimenez, we should probably take notice. Well, that is exactly what is happening as they battle it out with Lyon for the £6 million rated Mexican. Probably a safe bet he'll be worth more than £20 million in three years time... 13.30 BST: Despite relegation last year, many would be hard-pressed to argue against David Marshall of Cardiff City being voted goalkeeper of the year. And such form has seen the Scottish international rewarded with interest from Southampton, according to the Daily Mail, who are prepared to bid £8 million in order to secure his services. 13.24 BST: Cheeky cheeky Daniel Levy! The Telegraph claim the Tottenham supremo, who is currently presiding over his favourite time of year, tried to offer Gylfi Sigurdsson in return for Ben Davies and Michel Vorm of Swansea City. But failed. Swansea fancy Davies to be valued at £10 million alone while if Vorm is to be included in any deal, the Lilywhites will have to significantly increase their current bid. 13.14 BST: When I heard West Ham wanted to sign Mathieu Valbuena from Marseille, I have to say I scoffed at the proposition. Well West Ham's ambition shows no signs of abating after Sky Sources claim the Hammers have now made a £12 million bid to sign highly rated Ukranian winger Yehven Konoplyanka. He was wanted and almost signed by Liverpool in January for nearly £20 million. How times change... Sky Sources: West Ham have made a £12m bid for Dnipro star Yevhen Konoplyanka. #whufc - Pete O'Rourke (@SkySportsPeteO) July 8, 2014 13.07 BST: What a shock!!! Rumours about Klaas Jan Huntelaar leaving Schalke for the Premier League appear to be wide of the mark... Or so says Schalke sporting director Horst Heldt who told the club's official website he has received no contact from Liverpool about a move. He said: "Most recently, I've read that Liverpool FC should have interest in Klaas-Jan Huntelaar. Liverpool, Klaas-Jan and also his adviser have not contacted us. And we also have no interest in selling the player." We can almost guarantee that won't be the last we hear of Huntelaar this transfer window. 13.01 BST: Claims from TalkSport suggest Swansea City are closing in on the signing of Bosnia and Herzegovina midfielder Muhamed Besic from Ferencvaros. Their £4 million offer has reportedly been accepted and a three-year deal is soon to be signed. 12.55 BST: Newcastle are acting quickly to replace outgoing full back Mathieu Debuchy and have made a £5 million bid for Juventus defender Mauricio Isla according to Tuttosport. 12.48 BST: Tottenham and Manchester United's hopes of signing Memphis Depay took a blow today after PSV manager Philip Cocu told Voetbal International the player should remain in Holland for one more season. He said: ""I let Memphis know that it would good for him to have another year here. He has only one full season behind him. I think you need a certain foundation before making the next step. That is independent of the qualities that a person has. Therefore, he must stay at PSV at least one more year." 12.43 BST: PSG have long been advised (not officially) by many a journalist to stop going after the big name defenders and just sign Serge Aurier on a cheaper deal from Toulouse. Well it appears Laurent Blanc has come to his senses and has even called the Ivorian to persuade him to join the champions. Toulouse have an offer from Monaco to consider as wall but are hoping to sell the defender abroad. PSG are chasing highly-rated and available-cheap Toulouse defender Serge Aurier. 12.36 BST: Chelsea's ongoing battle with Atletico Madrid to sign Filipe Luis 'on the cheap' looks set to continue. Atleti may be resigned to losing their left-back but they won't let him go for a penny less than his £19 million release clause. And yet a report in the Metro claims Chelsea have upped their bid to just about £15 million. Someone at Chelsea needs to check their maths because as far as I can work out, that is still £4 million less than the asking price. Looks like this one is going to rumble on. 12.30 BST: Arsenal's long term target Lars Bender is subject to more interest from the Gunners as they seek a defensive midfielder. Bayer Leverkusen are reluctant to sell after tying the German international down to a long-term contract but the Daily Mail claim a bid will be forthcoming. The report also says if Arsene Wenger does not land his number 1 target he will go for either Morgan Schneiderlin of Southampton or Real Madrid's Sami Khedira. 12.23 BST: Marseille have stepped up their interest in this blog's favourite club (it's not, it's just they're keeping us very busy) Atletico Madrid's Javi Manquillo according to AS. The French club are set to beat the likes of Betis, Getafe and Elche to the full-back's signature as a £2 million deal is thrashed out. 12.17 BST: Read the full story here on Alexis Sanchez opting NOT to join Liverpool. 12.12 BST: Middlesborough's search for a new striker continues in the Belgian league. It may take a little longer to conclude though! Belgian striker Jelle Vossen wants to join Middlesbrough, after Genk rejected a bid. #boro - Kristof Terreur (@HLNinEngeland) July 8, 2014 12.08 BST: A blow for Liverpool, Spurs and Everton as TalkSport say Granada have begun talks with Porto about the sale of star man Yacine Brahimi. The Algerian won many admirers at the World Cup and it is said a £6.5 million fee can lure him away from La Liga. And it looks like the Portuguese giants are leading the chase. 11.59 BST: Chelsea's pursuit of Marcos Rojo has apparently made big news in Portugal, or so say Sport Witness. The Blues will be desperate for a replacement to fill the rather large void at left back, vacated by a certain Ashley Cole. 11.52 BST: Lyon have announced Guinea striker Mohammed Yattara has signed a two-year deal to keep him at the club following a successful loan spell with Troyes last season. 11.46 BST: Two updates from Gianluca Di Marzio on Inter Milan's transfer activity. First, Real Madrid, who had been happy to loan Casemiro have now asked for £12 million which Inter have stepped away from. It is too much for them but are hoping to remain negotiation for the player. And secondly Inter are very close to signing Gary Medel from Cardiff City for around £10 million. 11.40 BST: Everybody's favourite goalkeeper from the World Cup Guillermo Ochoa wants to stay in France. Doesn't seem to want to given the rejected contract offers. #MEX goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa has rejected two offers from Ligue 1 clubs (Bastia + 1 other) - agent reaffirms priority to remain in France - Mohammed Ali (@mohammedali_93) July 8, 2014 Ochoa's agent tells Europe 1 that his client will seek other European clubs if a move to a top Ligue 1 club fails this summer #MEX - Mohammed Ali (@mohammedali_93) July 8, 2014 11.36 BST: Firstly, decent signing by Aberdeen getting David Goodwillie in. Secondly, great banter from the Dons too. Striker joins the Dons pic.twitter.com/cozUQ6OsYB - Aberdeen FC (@AberdeenFC)  July 7, 2014 We promise he really is delighted to be signing for the Dons! pic.twitter.com/BoLdeWU0aZ - Aberdeen FC (@AberdeenFC) July 7, 2014 11.31 BST: Oh wow! Probably the transfer story of the day! Celtic could be in the running to sign 39-year-old Alessandro Del Piero on a free transfer. The Italian legend almost signed for the Bhoys two years ago and having seen his contract at Sydney FC run out has asked Ronny Deila to give him a call according to the Scottish Sun. Speaking to the paper he said: "Two years ago it was interesting and it would be interesting again. If we could talk then great. If you want I'll give you my phone number and you can pass it on! Celtic are a great team and I have always enjoyed playing in Scotland, so who knows? I know the league has changed with Rangers not being there, but they will be back soon enough. Celtic are also a club that could be in the group stage of the Champions League which is good. Sometimes to get there you just need a little bit of luck. Or experience." Look how happy Del Piero is about the possibility of going to Scotland! It is on the cards... Watch. This. Space. 11.28 BST: Who knew just how powerful Twitter would become. It is now being used by Lucas Leiva to wrangle himself a move from Liverpool to Napoli. The Brazilian has removed that he is a Liverpool player from his profile and UNFOLLOWED the Reds' official Twitter account. Put your claws away a Lucas! Napoli are said to be interested in the player with Liverpool looking at a possible loan deal. 11.23 BST: Respected journalist Graham Hunter tweeted a few things yesterday regarding Angel Di Maria's proposed move from Real Madrid. Here is his take on the saga. Ok, to clarify. I understand that #DiMaria is in huge demand. I believe RM willing to sell him for big fee to fund their further adventures - Graham Hunter (@BumperGraham) July 7, 2014 Personally I think they'd be mad to sell #DiMaria AND I think it'll be very hard to persuade Monaco to sell JR - Graham Hunter (@BumperGraham) July 7, 2014 However IF #DiMaria goes #Utd have a strong chance of getting him. But there's a queue. Perfect player for LVG though. I'd miss him in Liga - Graham Hunter (@BumperGraham) July 7, 2014 11.20 BST: Read the full story on Willy Caballero's move to Manchester City now. Also for your pre-lunch perusal, Lottar Matthaus tells reporters that Toni Kroos is the right fit for Real Madrid and that Bayern Munich will miss him. Read it here. 11.14 BST: Well summed up by ESPN's own Alex Shaw... Oof. Barcelona's Gerard Deulofeu: "I'd rather play for @stokecity than Real Madrid." http://t.co/rQxWXN2rmj - Alex Shaw (@AlexShawESPN) July 8, 2014 11.09 BST: Manchester United are being far more tactful this summer than last. A report in the Daily Star has suggested Utd officials are going to go directly to Mats Hummels' representatives to see if the German is interested in a move before publicly hounding Borussia Dortmund about a transfer. Given the embarrassment had at the hands of Cesc Fabregas and Ander Herrera (last summer) I'm sure Ed Woodward doesn't want a repeat performance this year. 11.05 BST: LUIS SUAREZ UPDATE! There is going to be a delay unfortunately. Liverpool are not happy at losing out on signing Alexis Sanchez and are taking it out on Barcelona. Not entirely fair given it was Sanchez' and not Barca's decision that the Chilean would not go to Anfield. Anyway, according to a report in the Independent, Liverpool are so bitter they have decided they want £75 million for their Uruguayan shoulder-muncher and not the £63 million being mooted as the agreed fee a few days ago.  Does anyone actually know what Suarez' release fee actually is? 11.00 BST: More from the Spanish champions Atletico as they chase Alessio Cerci from Torino. Reports yesterday suggested the Italian's agent was in Madrid to discuss a deal but Atleti apparently don't want to pay more than £15 million despite the attacker's £20 million valuation. 10.51 BST: Brutal Silvio Berlusconi has told new boss Pippo Inzaghi he must sell before he buys. Deals for Torino's Alessio Cerci and Genoa's Sime Vrsaljko are said to be all but finalised but the Milan supremo has told his manager and Adriano Galliani, the club must sell to buy. According to Gazzetto dello Sport, a meeting between the three at Berlusconi's house saw the former Italian president tell Inzaghi he must sell Alessandro Matri, M'Baye Niang and Robinho before any deals can go through. 10.45​ BST: Ageing full-backs are all the rage in Italy. First Roma revive Maicon's flailing career. Then Ashley Cole signs for the capital club yesterday. And now reports from Gazzetto dello Sport and Tuttosport claim Juventus are close to signing Manchester United veteran Patrice Evra. Apparently Evra's representatives are due in London today to speak to United officials to persuade them to allow him to move despite penning a one-year deal at Old Trafford just a few months ago. The Frenchman is said to want the move so he is guaranteed first-team football with a Champions League club, two things United can't offer given the signing of Luke Shaw. 10.40​ BST: Arsenal target Federico Marchetti has seen interest from AC Milan rise in the past few days. The Lazio goalkeeper is said to be close to joining The Rossoneri in a £7.5 million deal to be paid in three installments according to Il Messagero. 10.37 BST: Joe Hart must be starting to sweat. Willy Caballero signs from Malaga. NEW SIGNING: We are delighted to announce the signing of @willy_caballero. Full story: http://t.co/RmBdMDC0dE #mcfc pic.twitter.com/8ZPnG3GA03 - Manchester City FC (@MCFC) July 8, 2014 10.35 BST: Looks like Southampton might be losing another one of their stars. And Morgan Schneiderlin will be spoiled for choice as to where he goes. Lucky boy. L'Equipe say Arsenal, Tottenham, Dortmund and Napoli are all in for Morgan Schneiderlin. - Sport Witness (@Sport_Witness) July 8, 2014 10.30 BST: Arsenal fans jump for joy, I tell you, jump! Alexis Sanchez has agreed to join the club according to tuttomercatoweb. Barcelona and Arsenal have apparently agreed a fee too. It's all done! Except, obviously, the announcement and the fact this is clearly just a rumour. Still a lot of interest from Juventus. 10.26 BST: This whole Arturo Vidal thing is getting rather confusing. In a nutshell, there have been reports he wants to go but Juventus don't want to sell. There have been reports he doesn't want to go but Juve do want to sell. There have been reports Manchester United have offered huge pots of gold which Juve have turned away but are open to negotiationg. And most recently there were reports Vidal was enquired about by Utd some weeks ago but there has been nothing since. Confused? Yes I am too. No Arturo, we don't really know what is going on with your future either. Well the latest report from the Metro seems to think Manchester United have ploughed on with negotiations with Vidal's agent behind Juventus' back even though the Gazzetto Dello Sport reported the Bianconeri told Utd, hands off. It's like a soap opera. 10.20 BST: Mark Hughes is an ambitious man and fair play to him for that but trying to sign Eduardo may have been an ambition too far. According to a report in the Stoke Sentinel, the former Arsenal and Shakhtar Donetsk striker is set to join Brazilian side Flamengo on an 18-month deal. 10.16 BST: Another frustrated Chelsea youngster with a supposedly big future is Bertrand Traore. The Burkina Faso international spent last season on loan at Vitesse Arnhem and is set to return to the Dutch club as Chelsea have no room for him in their first team. Chelsea have now loaned seven players to Vitesse in the last 12 months: Traore, Wallace, Lucas Piazon, Patrick van Aanholt, Christian Atsu, Gael Kakuta and Sam Hutchinson. 10.11 BST: Tottenham are set to make an ambitious raid on Chelsea for £20 million striker Romelu Lukaku. The Belgian has told the club he wants to leave on a permanent deal and the Metro claim Spurs are seriously considering weighing up a bid. However, given the clubs' fractious relationship and Lukaku's desire to play in the Champions League, this one might not be as much of a goer as is being suggested. Romelu Lukaku has demanded a transfer from Chelsea and claims he wants to play for a Champions League club, putting half of Europe on alert in the process. 10.06 BST: After an excellent World Cup for the United States Men's National Team (official name) defender Matt Besler has attracted interest from around Europe. And according to Kicker, Bundesliga club Freiburg are very interested in signing the defender from Sporting Kansas City in the MLS. 10.01 BST: I told you there would be loads of Atleti news coming up. First Benfica goalkeeper Jan Oblak is close to signing after performing a no-show at Benfica's pre-season training. AS say a £16 million deal is close to being finalised. The same paper also claim Atleti will tie up a deal for Mario Mandzukic of Bayern after baulking at the £30 million asking price set for Alvaro Negredo at Manchester City. And it is not over yet. Atleti have also offered £25 million plus Leo Baptistao for Verona's Juan Iturbe who had been close to signing for Juventus just last week. The AS back pages working over-time. 9.57 BST:  Alvaro Morata is close to a move to Juventus from Real Madrid according to AS.  9.52 BST: There'll be plenty more Atletico Madrid updates this week with players expected to be coming and going. One such player we haven't heard much from is Christian Rodriguez. He spoke to El Pais in Uruguay and said, "Today what I want is to play. I was Liga champion and a finalist in the Champions League, but when you do not play, the taste is different. I feel that this trophy was not as deserved as I did not play." 9.46 BST: It's going on in Germany. Freiburg sporting director Klemens Hartenbach says "there are situations in which things can happen that have previously been ruled out," according to an interview in Badische Zeitung. Firstly, Borussia Dortmund have made one final offer for Matthias Ginter. And Freiburg are talking to Benfica's Stefan Mitrovic over a deal to replace the outgoing Ginter. 9.41 BST: Just because this is an incredible fact. Ross McCormack is now the 8th most expensive British striker in history behind Carroll, Rooney, Bent, Shearer, Fletcher, Sturridge & Fowler. - Andrew Haigh (@AndrewHaigh) July 8, 2014 9.40 BST: DONE DEAL! It has finally happened. The fee may be undisclosed but it is widely being reported as in the £10 million region. OFFICIAL: @Rossmccormack44 signs for Fulham. Welcome to the Club, Ross! http://t.co/wC0ta0jVwh #FFC pic.twitter.com/2IJGMFD6XR - Fulham Football Club (@FulhamFC) July 8, 2014 9.38 BST: In not quite so high profile Bayern Munich news, reserve goalkeeper Lukas Raeder has left the club on a free. According to TZ, he is set to join Vitoria Setubal in Portugal. 9.35 BST: It is getting to crunch-time for the Toni Kroos transfer to Real Madrid. According to TZ, Bayern Munich have withdrawn their contract offer to the midfielder who wanted to earn the same amount as Philip Lahm and Thomas Muller, believed to be around the £10 million mark. Claims in Spain clearly suggest the deal with Los Blancos is all but done with the Spanish giants offering him huge wages. Kroos wages at Real Madrid agreed at €12m, same as Gotze is on at Bayern. German club wanted to pay less than €7m. [Bild] - Sport Witness (@Sport_Witness) July 8, 2014 9.30 BST: Former Newcastle man Luuk de Jong, who might have been holding out hopes of a permanent deal with the Magpies following his loan and to join his brother Siem at St James' Park, is still set to leave Borussia Munchengladbach. But not for the bright lights of the north-east of England. According to Bild, he will sign a deal with PSV Eindhoven today with the fee believed to be somewhere between £5 million and £6 million. 9.24 BST: A quick update from Germany now as our man Stephan Uersfeld has told us Hertha Berlin and AZ Alkmaar are in a dispute over midfielder Roby Beerens. Hertha are unwilling to pay over £1.5 million while Alkmaar claim that is not enough for their man. Sporting director Michael Preetz told Kicker the Dutch club need to make a decision this week of "Otherwise, we will look elsewhere." He also confirmed the German club would not be signing Askhan Dejagah because he is too expensive. Askhan Dejagah won't be returning 'home' any time soon according to Hertha Berlin because he is too expensive. 9.21 BST: Almost two done deals for Inter Milan with our man in Italy, Ben Gladwell, reporting Yann M'Vila of Rubin Kazan and Dodo of Roma are set to join on one-year loan deals. The announcements are expected later today. 9.17 BST: Fiorentina just can't seem to catch a break at the moment. They're being pillaged for Juan Cuadrado but don't want to sell and now Alberto Aquilani's agent has told the press that talks over a new contract are on ice. Bad times to be a Viola fan... 9.10 BST: And finally our updates from Ian Holyman end with the news Olympiakos love French football. Or so it would seem. They've already signed Eric Abidal from Monaco and have decided to sign former teammate Delvin Ndinga from the French giants on a three-year deal following a successful loan spell last season. But it does not end there, oh no, with the news Mathieu Dossevi of Valenciennes has also joined the Greek Champions, as announced on his Twitter account (I am Greek and this roughly translates as " I am extremely happy that I am an Olympiakos player"). eimai poly xaroumenos pou eimai pektes apo olympiakos... #sorryforthemistakes #lol #olympiacos #newstart #athens #happiness #proud - Matthieu Dossevi (@MDossevi) July 7, 2014 You'd think that was enough but no, according to footmercato.net, Dossevi will be joined by teammate Arthur Masuaku in Piraeus too.  9.07 BST: In case you were asleep or doing something more interesting with your Monday evening, Manchester City announced the loaning out of promising young midfielder Marcos Lopes to Lille on a one-year deal. If you don't speak French, we promise this translates as "he's joined"... or thereabouts. À noter que @Rony10Lopes ne rejoindra le groupe qu'après l'Euro U19 (du 19 au 31/07) auquel il s'apprête à participer pic.twitter.com/pgdGxeO4Ho - LOSC (@losclive) July 7, 2014 9.05 BST: Marseille may be about to lose talisman Mathieu Valbuena to La Liga but what they'll lose in goals they're hoping to shore up in defence. The French giants are looking to bring in Norwegian international Vegard Forren from Molde. Marseille are looking at Norwegian international Vegard Forren as they seek to stiffen their defence. 9.00 BST: Our man in France Ian Holyman has updated us on a few of the rumours flying around across the Channel. And first of his nuggets is that Monaco are interested in CSKA Sofia prodigy Ivaylo Chochev, 21, who is also being pursued by Palermo of Serie A. 8.19 BST: A-League side Brisbane Roar have beefed up their squad, announcing two new signings today. Jamie Young returns to Queensland after plying his trade in the lower leagues of the UK for more than a decade, while Daniel Bowles his signed from fellow A-League club Adelaide United. Later Chelsea Hot on the heels of the Ashley Cole to Roma news -- which involves a 113,000 pounds-a-week pay cut, according to Tuesday's Sun -- the Daily Mail says another Chelsea pensioner could be about to join him. Samuel Eto'o has lucrative offers from China and Turkey to consider, but he'd rather keep things interesting and return to Italy, where he has already spent two fruitful years with Inter Milan. What's more, he's willing to follow Cole's lead and lower his salary to a mere 3 million pounds to push things through. How might that affect another Chelsea striker? Maybe not much. The Mirror says that Romelu Lukaku won't stomach another season on loan and instead wants to be playing Champions League football for a club at which he is permanently under contract. Who's Man City keeping? Joe Hart might have to set his sights elsewhere soon. Willy Caballero, the Argentinian goalkeeper, has touched down for a medical at Manchester City. The Manchester Evening News has pictures of him, well, walking, while the Guardian notes that Cabellero was signed by Manuel Pellegrini from Malaga and will not have arrived at the Etihad to be an also-ran. Any false moves of the type that let Costel Pantilimon in this past season, and Hart might face a far sterner task in getting his place back. Caballero was first linked with City a year ago -- slightly predictably, or so it seemed -- and now Pellegrini seems to have gotten his man. Do you play football? Then Arsenal wants you Arsenal, whose will-they-won't-they sagas make them firm favourites of any self-respecting transfer blog, seem about to move disappointingly early this time out, with the Guardian on the case again and reporting that their fee for Newcastle's Mathieu Debuchy will be a very precise 7.9 million pounds. That one should go through pretty quickly -- Debuchy is even breaking his holiday to see this through, which always sounds a more dramatic step than it is. The fun might not end there; a loan move for Costa Rica sensation Joel Campbell might water that fee down a little. Carl Jenkinson won't be used as part of the deal, though -- the same article says Newcastle have been offered one-time footballer Micah Richards to fill their right-back void but would rather plump for Daryl Janmaat or Ricardo van Rhijn. With the price looking right and both sides keen on a move, it seems Mathieu Debuchy to Arsenal from Newcastle is almost a done deal. And the Gunners might be in business again very soon indeed. Their pursuit of Alexis Sanchez is not exactly hot off the press, but more recent news is that things might get a little more straightforward now. The Liverpool Echo says Sanchez has been swayed by the capital's bright lights, and Brendan Rodgers' side is resigned to seeing him at Emirates Stadium next season. There's yet more -- kind of. Arsenal are among those that have been linked with Fiorentina and Colombia wide man Juan Cuadrado, but his club insist they are yet to receive any offers. However, their sporting director, Daniele Prade, doesn't sound overly optimistic about keeping his man and said in Tuttosport that, "We will do our best to make him stay with us". Atleti like Alex Witsel They might not quite have lived up to their billing at the World Cup, but Belgians still seem to be all the rage. Marca claims that Atletico Madrid are courting Axel Witsel, the midfield dynamo whose last action in Brazil was to volley a late half-chance over the bar against Argentina. It says Atleti would like him to complete their lineup in the centre of the park for next term -- and that they're in for his Zenit teammate, left-sided Argentinian player Cristian Ansaldi too. The prognosis? Mixed: Witsel cost Zenit 40 million euros and would not come cheaply this time either, while Ansaldi is said to be settled in Russia and would not be receptive to a proposed loan. Neymar who? In a parallel dimension, Neymar's back injury doesn't matter all that much to Brazil. Stepping in is one-time wunderkind Alexandre Pato, still just 24, and he slaloms past Per Mertesacker and Mats Hummels at will to remind the Brasileiros that he can be their darling too. In this particular time and place, though, Pato's career has hit the skids; he isn't in the World Cup squad and can be found whiling away his time agonisingly near to the action as a player with Sao Paolo. But is the ex-Milan forward's star back on the rise? Corriere Dello Sport says he is dreaming of a return to Italy -- and there is a chance he might get his wish, with former enemies Inter apparently sniffing around.	sports

Carlos Bianchi the logical candidates are in the semifinals - ESPN FC	BUENOS AIRES -- A few days ago, before the round of 16, I started to write a column saying that the logical semifinals would be Germany-Brazil and Argentina-Holland. But I thought it was very probable that there would be surprises, given that there was not a huge difference between those four teams and those they were up against. In the end there were no surprises, although a few teams came close: Switzerland took Argentina all the way, Brazil had to wait for penalties to knock Chile out, and Holland did the same against Costa Rica. There were several moments in those games where one small incident (the goalpost, a poor finish, a refereeing mistake) was the difference between the winner and the loser. That does not mean that the four semifinalists are not there on merit. Theu were, no doubt, the ones who had the upper hand and always offered more than their opponents. It is no coincidence that they have history and are used to these situations, and in the long run they made that experience count. It is true, though, that not one of the four looked comfortable. They were never far ahead, either on the scoreboard or on the field. Everyone knows that they were better and they deserve to be where they are, but at the same time everyone knows they are in debt. Indeed, that explains why all four are practically equal candidates: They each have something that makes them dare to dream of winning the Cup, but at the same time they also have some problem that might leave them by the wayside. Germany-Brazil Of the four left standing, Germany is the only team that has not had to withstand so much pressure. It also seems to be the only one that has its whole squad fit without any significant absentee. The injuries to Neymar, Angel Di María and Nigel De Jong will certainly have an impact on how the Brazilian, Argentine and Dutch teams respectively perform. Germany lost only Reuss before the tournament, but today it has all its players fit, or at least so it appears. We will soon see if, at some point, they will pay the physical price of having paid so many midday games (three of five) in hot places, as well as the tiring journeys over practically the whole country (Manaus, Salvador, Recife, Porto Alegre and Río de Janeiro, as well as Belo Horizonte on Tuesday). With not many natural forwards, the Germans have found a way to create enough chances anyway. Against France, if they had been more clinical in the final third, the difference would have been bigger. For now, Germany's buildup play is far better than their finishing. Brazil vs. Germany: Tuesday, 4 ET, 9 BST (ESPN and WatchESPN) - Marcotti: Titans collide in the semifinals - Honigstein: Bierhoff's technological focus - Torre: Scolari lightens the mood - Brewin: Battered Brazil vs. vulnerable Germany - Smith: Jogo bonito the exception, not the rule - 50-50 Challenge: Brazil vs. Germany - Duarte: Brazil move past star absences - Cox: Brazil and Germany's role reversal Brazil's defense, which will also be missing their captain Thiago Silva, suspended after another yellow card, doesn't look the best prepared to stop that superpopulated midfield, which can get through on goal anywhere in different ways. If Germany improves its finishing, it has a big chance of getting through to the final in the Maracanã. Germany has, as I see it, two problems: The first is that its defense doesn't instil confidence. Ghana exposed it, and France could have if they had gone for it instead of choosing to lose with dignity. But the big problem for the Germans is that they are playing against the hosts. We still don't know how much that support will add to a Brazil team that is not overendowed in any department and is missing its captain and its star, but there is no doubt that Felipe Scolari's men will take the field with the desire to beat the Europeans just as they did the Colombians. In general, Brazil's first-half performances have been good, with a lot of energy, but as the time has passed that intensity has decreased. David Luiz has been, up to now, the standard-bearer with his displays and his aggressiveness, and the fans applaud that as if they were also aware of the limitations of a team that is not at the level required by its tradition, at least when it comes to playing good football. Indeed, what is missing from Brazil is football: They do not have creativity in midfield or up front, Hulk gives everything but he is a goal-scorer by trade and Fred so far has not justified his inclusion. Now without Neymar, it is difficult to see who will supply the goals the Barcelona player did and how. We will see how they set up for the game on Tuesday. It will be interesting to see what happens after the first goal, particularly if that goal is scored by Germany and the hosts have to come out and chase the game. Argentina-Netherlands Paradoxically, Holland was the team that created the most chances against their opponents in the 90 minutes, but the only team taken to extra time and penalties. Between the woodwork and Keylor Navas, Costa Rica survived 120 minutes before falling in the penalties. Arjen Robben still makes the difference, but Robin van Persie missed chances, and so the game got more difficult for the Netherlands. Without De Jong, we will have to see how they set up to defend against a team like Argentina, which asks more questions of them both through their attitude and individual abilities. We will have to wait as well to see how much more attacking Argentina will do, knowing that they don't want to be left at the mercy of a team set up for the counterattack like Louis van Gaal's Holland. Getting Ready For Argentina vs. Netherlands: - McIntyre: Argentina's defense rising to occasion - Delaney: Old foes reunite in Argentina vs. Netherlands - McIntyre: Superstars collide in Messi vs. Robben - Cox: Four teams, four key battles - Marcotti: Previewing the World Cup semifinals - World Cup Power Rankings: Germany on top - Ames: Gamesmanship alive and well Against Belgium, the match was opened up very early for Alejandro Sabella's men, thanks to Gonzalo Higuain's excellent technique that resulted in a goal. But against the Netherlands, if the match remains scoreless, it is much more likely that the teams will study each other and, returning to boxing metaphors, neither one will be looking to land the knockout blow knowing it might leave them open to being knocked down themselves. Argentina also looked more defensively solid in the round of 16. It is strange to think they might turn their back on what was so difficult to achieve in search of a more attacking formation that would leave them exposed against the speed of Robben and co. Robin van Persie and Lionel Messi take center stage in the Netherlands-Argentina semifinal. Anyhow, I still think that Argentina is, within the existing parity, the team with the biggest advantage, the best forwards. It is true that they have lost Di Maria, who today is the player who makes the biggest difference after Lionel Messi. It is also true that Sergio Aguero is not 100 percent fit and that Higuain only made his appearance in the fifth game. But in spite of all that, they still have strength in depth and attacking options. As well as having a certain Messi, of course. In such closed games, I repeat that it is those players who have the goal etched between their eyes who should make those small but decisive differences. Finally, I was surprised that Belgium manager Marc Wilmots said that Argentina had not impressed him and that they are a run-of-the-mill team. It would be good to know what his team did to make a better impression in the 82 minutes they had to turn the game around. Just like France, they gave the feeling that they settled for losing by a small margin, when at this stage of the tournament, it is better to take a risk and go all-in, since any defeat is simply that -- a farewell. It's anybody's tournament In short, all four semifinalists could be champions. Not one has clearly dominated, all have won by the smallest margin. Those players who have made a difference, not by coincidence are the tournament's top scorers, yet have left their mark with fleeting appearances, like Messi, Muller, Neymar or even Robben. It is a shame that a World Cup that started with so much excitement should have gradually been deflating, but it is understandable given the great parity in world football. At this point, when each game is all or nothing, do not expect to see anybody taking too many risks. Much less with the heat and the times of the matches, which oblige teams to ration their energy. Once more, it is sure to be certain players at specific moments who make the difference.

The Premier League side are apparently set to pay Benfica 25 million euros for the Serbian's services. 20:40 BST: After enjoying a successful spell on loan at Everton last season, Gareth Barry has signed a three-year deal with the club, having left Manchester City last month following the expiry of his contract.

Incredible. 16.29 BST: It looks like Dejan Lovren's move to Liverpool is edging closer and closer as the Daily Express reports Southampton have lined up a replacement in Bruno Ecuele Manga. The Lorient defender would be available for less than £10 million and with the sale of Lovren at around the £25 million mark, Saints will make a tidy profit on this deal. Everton are also supposedly interested. 16.20 BST: Brace yourselves Crystal Palace fans. Jonny Williams, probably more well-known as Joniesta, is being touted for a move from the club. The fan favourite was loaned out when Tony Pulis was appointed last year and it looks like the midfield sensation will have little to no future at Palace if he stays under Pulis. There is just a complete contrast in styles. And that has prompted former Selhurst Park favourite Jonathan Parr to encourage his new club Ipswich, who loaned Joniesta last season, to bring him in on a permanent deal.  Parr said: "I spoke to Jonny Williams, who was here on loan last season of course and he couldn't speak highly enough of the club. Maybe I can get him to join me. I'll give it a go. It could be fun!" 16.13 BST: A rehash from a few days ago I believe but L'Equipe are reporting Monaco are set to bid for Newcastle's Moussa Sissoko. 16.05 BST: They're the only ones running it AGAIN today but Cheshire Today seem to think the Mehdi Benatia deal from Roma to Manchester City is nearing completion for around £30 million.

Should be a fun summer for the Swans fans. 15.22 BST: Remember that year when Fulham got to the UEFA Cup final and lost to Atletico Madrid spearheaded by Diego Forlan and Sergio Aguero? Fulham's right back that season was John Pantsil. And while the manager, Roy Hodgson, is now managing England, the right back has just signed a deal to play for Martizberg United in South Africa. And good luck to him. 15.15 BST: Sunderland and Stoke are set to fight it out for Marseille's Rod Fanni. The big defender could be available for as little as £3 million after Newcastle turned down the opportunity to sign the Frenchman. 15.09 BST: REAL MADRID DEALT UNUSUAL BLOW IN TRANSFER WINDOW! No, seriously! Usually footballers can't wait to profess how they have always supported Real Madrid and it would be a dream to play there etc etc. OK, James Rodriguez has already done that but he has also now professed his loyalty to Monaco by saying in El Mundo Deportivo he wants to stay at the French club. Lets see how long that feeling lasts.  James Rodriguez will be staying put for at least one more year at Monaco. 14.56 BST: Some updates from ESPN FC's own Jonathan Johnson on the Serge Aurier to PSG rumours. Serge Aurier to @footmercato: "I have heard of PSG's interest. They are a very good club, one of Europe's best. They are in the top 8." #PSG - Jonathan Johnson (@Jon_LeGossip) July 8, 2014 Aurier: "It is interesting to know that the club with the means to buy anyone they want are interested in me. I am also Parisian." #PSG #TFC - Jonathan Johnson (@Jon_LeGossip) July 8, 2014 Aurier: "Me being Parisian makes the link stronger. Apart from that, I will let the competent people around me take care of it." #PSG #TFC - Jonathan Johnson (@Jon_LeGossip) July 8, 2014 Aurier: "People said I had already signed an agreement with Arsenal. This is not true. All I can say is that I like EPL the most." #AFC #TFC - Jonathan Johnson (@Jon_LeGossip) July 8, 2014 Aurier: "Playing in England is a dream, but sometimes they do not materialise. If PSG or ASM are keen, I won't ignore that." #PSG #ASM #TFC - Jonathan Johnson (@Jon_LeGossip) July 8, 2014 Aurier: "PSG & ASM can meet my representatives. We will see what happens. What I want is a club where I am guaranteed to play." #PSG #ASM - Jonathan Johnson (@Jon_LeGossip) July 8, 2014 14.51 BST: Wonderfully admirable from Athletic Bilbao but makes the life of a transfer blogger that little more difficult! !!! RT @arkulari Athletic is starting the preseason with 34 players, 29 of them came from the youth sector. Unique. (via @canteraJavi ) - Adam Digby (@Adz77) July 8, 2014 14.50 BST: Everyone else may be leaving Atletico Madrid but Marca have today reported Brazilian centre back Miranda, isn't going anywhere. Relief at last. Miranda: "Don't worry, I'm staying" http://t.co/hnbjTJmShZ pic.twitter.com/x3XpXLh9IC - MARCA in English (@MARCAinENGLISH) July 8, 2014 14.43 BST: DONE DEAL! Apologies for being a bit late to the start with this one but young Botafogo midfielder Octavio has signed for Fiorentina in a one-year loan deal with an option to make the move permanent next summer. 14.40 BST: Highly rated Cagliari central defender Davide Astori could be on his way to Lazio according to Il Tempo. The capital club have agreed a four-year deal with the Italian who will cost £1.2 million. All that remains is the approval of Claudio Lotito, the Lazio president, to finalise the transfer. 14.32 BST: This is funny. Thanks to Sport Witness for clearing this ridiculous rumour up. Yaya Toure to Man Utd? Please. Le Parisien, normally reliable, may have lost their minds a little. They pick PSG as main club in for Yaya, and Man United plus Chelsea. - Sport Witness (@Sport_Witness) July 8, 2014 14.30 BST: The Inter revamp continues as Tuttosport claim the clearing of the old guard will carry on with the sales of Walter Samuel and Esteban Cambiasso who are both headed for Sampdoria. Walter Samuel could be joining compatriot Esteban Cambiasso on his way out of Inter Milan. 14.22 BST: Amid reported interest from Barcelona for the services of former Real Madrid man Gonzalo Higuain, the Argentine has moved to confirm he has no intention of leaving Napoli. Read the full story here. 14.15 BST: Pablo Armero has been in the headlines recently after having a go at Rafa Benitez for not rating him and then for dancing like a pro when Colombia came home from the World Cup in widespread celebration. After linking himself with a move to Arsenal or Liverpool, the Colombian has now been mentioned in the same sentence as Udinese according to tuttoudinese.it. 14.08 BST: Liverpool's Danish defender Daniel Agger is being forced out of the club and touted with a move abroad. The Dane barely featured under Brendan Rodgers last season and was touted for a move to Barcelona but it is thought the Spanish giants have turned down the chance to sign him. El Mundo Deportivo say the Catalan giants have cooled their interest due to the player's recent injury record. 14.00 BST: This could get a touch bitter. Wolfsburg are chasing some big names and were today rejected by Alvaro Morata according to the Spaniard's agent. Juanma Lopez told Kicker, "Wolfsburg are without a chance. Alvaro wants to join Juve. Hopefully, the transfer will be done within the next one or two days." The same report reckons Wolfsburg will now go after Romelu Lukaku or Divock Origi. 13.50 BST: New Galatasaray boss Cesare Prandelli has targeted Sunderland playmaker Emanuele Giaccherini. The Sunderland Echo claim the 29-year-old who only signed for the Mackems last season in a £6 million deal has been targeted by the former Italy manager who is a huge fan of the winger. However the report also suggests Giaccherini is keen to stay at the Stadium of Light after only showing glimpses of his potential. This could be the last time Emanuele Giaccherini celebrates with his Sunderland teammates after interest from Galatasaray has surfaced. 13.42 BST: Ecuador's Enner Valencia has made no secret of using the World Cup as a shop window to tart himself to the big clubs in Europe. And it would appear it has worked after L'Equipe reported clubs from all over the continent are keen. Porto, Sporting Lisbon, Sevilla, Valencia, Fiorentina, Napoli, Tottenham, Everton, West Ham, Newcastle, Augsburg and Hertha are all said to be thinking about an offer. Now, it just needs to come to fruition for the Ecuadorian hitman. 13.36 BST: Porto are no strangers to the South American market and the potential profits it holds. Just ask them about Falcao, James Rodriguez and soon Jackson Martinez. All bought at a pittence and sold for huge fees. So when they go after a player from Club America and he's called Raul Jimenez, we should probably take notice. Well, that is exactly what is happening as they battle it out with Lyon for the £6 million rated Mexican. Probably a safe bet he'll be worth more than £20 million in three years time... 13.30 BST: Despite relegation last year, many would be hard-pressed to argue against David Marshall of Cardiff City being voted goalkeeper of the year. And such form has seen the Scottish international rewarded with interest from Southampton, according to the Daily Mail, who are prepared to bid £8 million in order to secure his services. 13.24 BST: Cheeky cheeky Daniel Levy! The Telegraph claim the Tottenham supremo, who is currently presiding over his favourite time of year, tried to offer Gylfi Sigurdsson in return for Ben Davies and Michel Vorm of Swansea City. But failed. Swansea fancy Davies to be valued at £10 million alone while if Vorm is to be included in any deal, the Lilywhites will have to significantly increase their current bid. 13.14 BST: When I heard West Ham wanted to sign Mathieu Valbuena from Marseille, I have to say I scoffed at the proposition. Well West Ham's ambition shows no signs of abating after Sky Sources claim the Hammers have now made a £12 million bid to sign highly rated Ukranian winger Yehven Konoplyanka. He was wanted and almost signed by Liverpool in January for nearly £20 million. How times change... Sky Sources: West Ham have made a £12m bid for Dnipro star Yevhen Konoplyanka. #whufc - Pete O'Rourke (@SkySportsPeteO) July 8, 2014 13.07 BST: What a shock!!! Rumours about Klaas Jan Huntelaar leaving Schalke for the Premier League appear to be wide of the mark... Or so says Schalke sporting director Horst Heldt who told the club's official website he has received no contact from Liverpool about a move. He said: "Most recently, I've read that Liverpool FC should have interest in Klaas-Jan Huntelaar. Liverpool, Klaas-Jan and also his adviser have not contacted us. And we also have no interest in selling the player." We can almost guarantee that won't be the last we hear of Huntelaar this transfer window. 13.01 BST: Claims from TalkSport suggest Swansea City are closing in on the signing of Bosnia and Herzegovina midfielder Muhamed Besic from Ferencvaros. Their £4 million offer has reportedly been accepted and a three-year deal is soon to be signed. 12.55 BST: Newcastle are acting quickly to replace outgoing full back Mathieu Debuchy and have made a £5 million bid for Juventus defender Mauricio Isla according to Tuttosport. 12.48 BST: Tottenham and Manchester United's hopes of signing Memphis Depay took a blow today after PSV manager Philip Cocu told Voetbal International the player should remain in Holland for one more season. He said: ""I let Memphis know that it would good for him to have another year here. He has only one full season behind him. I think you need a certain foundation before making the next step. That is independent of the qualities that a person has. Therefore, he must stay at PSV at least one more year." 12.43 BST: PSG have long been advised (not officially) by many a journalist to stop going after the big name defenders and just sign Serge Aurier on a cheaper deal from Toulouse. Well it appears Laurent Blanc has come to his senses and has even called the Ivorian to persuade him to join the champions. Toulouse have an offer from Monaco to consider as wall but are hoping to sell the defender abroad. PSG are chasing highly-rated and available-cheap Toulouse defender Serge Aurier. 12.36 BST: Chelsea's ongoing battle with Atletico Madrid to sign Filipe Luis 'on the cheap' looks set to continue. Atleti may be resigned to losing their left-back but they won't let him go for a penny less than his £19 million release clause. And yet a report in the Metro claims Chelsea have upped their bid to just about £15 million. Someone at Chelsea needs to check their maths because as far as I can work out, that is still £4 million less than the asking price. Looks like this one is going to rumble on. 12.30 BST: Arsenal's long term target Lars Bender is subject to more interest from the Gunners as they seek a defensive midfielder. Bayer Leverkusen are reluctant to sell after tying the German international down to a long-term contract but the Daily Mail claim a bid will be forthcoming. The report also says if Arsene Wenger does not land his number 1 target he will go for either Morgan Schneiderlin of Southampton or Real Madrid's Sami Khedira. 12.23 BST: Marseille have stepped up their interest in this blog's favourite club (it's not, it's just they're keeping us very busy) Atletico Madrid's Javi Manquillo according to AS. The French club are set to beat the likes of Betis, Getafe and Elche to the full-back's signature as a £2 million deal is thrashed out. 12.17 BST: Read the full story here on Alexis Sanchez opting NOT to join Liverpool. 12.12 BST: Middlesborough's search for a new striker continues in the Belgian league. It may take a little longer to conclude though! Belgian striker Jelle Vossen wants to join Middlesbrough, after Genk rejected a bid. #boro - Kristof Terreur (@HLNinEngeland) July 8, 2014 12.08 BST: A blow for Liverpool, Spurs and Everton as TalkSport say Granada have begun talks with Porto about the sale of star man Yacine Brahimi. The Algerian won many admirers at the World Cup and it is said a £6.5 million fee can lure him away from La Liga. And it looks like the Portuguese giants are leading the chase. 11.59 BST: Chelsea's pursuit of Marcos Rojo has apparently made big news in Portugal, or so say Sport Witness. The Blues will be desperate for a replacement to fill the rather large void at left back, vacated by a certain Ashley Cole. 11.52 BST: Lyon have announced Guinea striker Mohammed Yattara has signed a two-year deal to keep him at the club following a successful loan spell with Troyes last season. 11.46 BST: Two updates from Gianluca Di Marzio on Inter Milan's transfer activity. First, Real Madrid, who had been happy to loan Casemiro have now asked for £12 million which Inter have stepped away from. It is too much for them but are hoping to remain negotiation for the player. And secondly Inter are very close to signing Gary Medel from Cardiff City for around £10 million. 11.40 BST: Everybody's favourite goalkeeper from the World Cup Guillermo Ochoa wants to stay in France. Doesn't seem to want to given the rejected contract offers. #MEX goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa has rejected two offers from Ligue 1 clubs (Bastia + 1 other) - agent reaffirms priority to remain in France - Mohammed Ali (@mohammedali_93) July 8, 2014 Ochoa's agent tells Europe 1 that his client will seek other European clubs if a move to a top Ligue 1 club fails this summer #MEX - Mohammed Ali (@mohammedali_93) July 8, 2014 11.36 BST: Firstly, decent signing by Aberdeen getting David Goodwillie in. Secondly, great banter from the Dons too.

Probably the transfer story of the day! Celtic could be in the running to sign 39-year-old Alessandro Del Piero on a free transfer. The Italian legend almost signed for the Bhoys two years ago and having seen his contract at Sydney FC run out has asked Ronny Deila to give him a call according to the Scottish Sun. Speaking to the paper he said: "Two years ago it was interesting and it would be interesting again. If we could talk then great. If you want I'll give you my phone number and you can pass it on! Celtic are a great team and I have always enjoyed playing in Scotland, so who knows? I know the league has changed with Rangers not being there, but they will be back soon enough. Celtic are also a club that could be in the group stage of the Champions League which is good. Sometimes to get there you just need a little bit of luck. Or experience." Look how happy Del Piero is about the possibility of going to Scotland! It is on the cards... Watch. This. Space. 11.28 BST: Who knew just how powerful Twitter would become. It is now being used by Lucas Leiva to wrangle himself a move from Liverpool to Napoli. The Brazilian has removed that he is a Liverpool player from his profile and UNFOLLOWED the Reds' official Twitter account. Put your claws away a Lucas! Napoli are said to be interested in the player with Liverpool looking at a possible loan deal. 11.23 BST: Respected journalist Graham Hunter tweeted a few things yesterday regarding Angel Di Maria's proposed move from Real Madrid. Here is his take on the saga. Ok, to clarify. I understand that #DiMaria is in huge demand. I believe RM willing to sell him for big fee to fund their further adventures - Graham Hunter (@BumperGraham) July 7, 2014 Personally I think they'd be mad to sell #DiMaria AND I think it'll be very hard to persuade Monaco to sell JR - Graham Hunter (@BumperGraham) July 7, 2014 However IF #DiMaria goes #Utd have a strong chance of getting him. But there's a queue. Perfect player for LVG though. I'd miss him in Liga - Graham Hunter (@BumperGraham) July 7, 2014 11.20 BST: Read the full story on Willy Caballero's move to Manchester City now. Also for your pre-lunch perusal, Lottar Matthaus tells reporters that Toni Kroos is the right fit for Real Madrid and that Bayern Munich will miss him. Read it here. 11.14 BST: Well summed up by ESPN's own Alex Shaw... Oof. Barcelona's Gerard Deulofeu: "I'd rather play for @stokecity than Real Madrid." http://t.co/rQxWXN2rmj - Alex Shaw (@AlexShawESPN) July 8, 2014 11.09 BST: Manchester United are being far more tactful this summer than last. A report in the Daily Star has suggested Utd officials are going to go directly to Mats Hummels' representatives to see if the German is interested in a move before publicly hounding Borussia Dortmund about a transfer. Given the embarrassment had at the hands of Cesc Fabregas and Ander Herrera (last summer) I'm sure Ed Woodward doesn't want a repeat performance this year. 11.05 BST: LUIS SUAREZ UPDATE! There is going to be a delay unfortunately. Liverpool are not happy at losing out on signing Alexis Sanchez and are taking it out on Barcelona. Not entirely fair given it was Sanchez' and not Barca's decision that the Chilean would not go to Anfield. Anyway, according to a report in the Independent, Liverpool are so bitter they have decided they want £75 million for their Uruguayan shoulder-muncher and not the £63 million being mooted as the agreed fee a few days ago.  Does anyone actually know what Suarez' release fee actually is? 11.00 BST: More from the Spanish champions Atletico as they chase Alessio Cerci from Torino. Reports yesterday suggested the Italian's agent was in Madrid to discuss a deal but Atleti apparently don't want to pay more than £15 million despite the attacker's £20 million valuation. 10.51 BST: Brutal Silvio Berlusconi has told new boss Pippo Inzaghi he must sell before he buys. Deals for Torino's Alessio Cerci and Genoa's Sime Vrsaljko are said to be all but finalised but the Milan supremo has told his manager and Adriano Galliani, the club must sell to buy. According to Gazzetto dello Sport, a meeting between the three at Berlusconi's house saw the former Italian president tell Inzaghi he must sell Alessandro Matri, M'Baye Niang and Robinho before any deals can go through. 10.45​ BST: Ageing full-backs are all the rage in Italy. First Roma revive Maicon's flailing career. Then Ashley Cole signs for the capital club yesterday. And now reports from Gazzetto dello Sport and Tuttosport claim Juventus are close to signing Manchester United veteran Patrice Evra. Apparently Evra's representatives are due in London today to speak to United officials to persuade them to allow him to move despite penning a one-year deal at Old Trafford just a few months ago. The Frenchman is said to want the move so he is guaranteed first-team football with a Champions League club, two things United can't offer given the signing of Luke Shaw. 10.40​ BST: Arsenal target Federico Marchetti has seen interest from AC Milan rise in the past few days. The Lazio goalkeeper is said to be close to joining The Rossoneri in a £7.5 million deal to be paid in three installments according to Il Messagero. 10.37 BST: Joe Hart must be starting to sweat. Willy Caballero signs from Malaga. NEW SIGNING: We are delighted to announce the signing of @willy_caballero. Full story: http://t.co/RmBdMDC0dE #mcfc pic.twitter.com/8ZPnG3GA03 - Manchester City FC (@MCFC) July 8, 2014 10.35 BST: Looks like Southampton might be losing another one of their stars. And Morgan Schneiderlin will be spoiled for choice as to where he goes. Lucky boy. L'Equipe say Arsenal, Tottenham, Dortmund and Napoli are all in for Morgan Schneiderlin. - Sport Witness (@Sport_Witness) July 8, 2014 10.30 BST: Arsenal fans jump for joy, I tell you, jump! Alexis Sanchez has agreed to join the club according to tuttomercatoweb. Barcelona and Arsenal have apparently agreed a fee too. It's all done! Except, obviously, the announcement and the fact this is clearly just a rumour. Still a lot of interest from Juventus. 10.26 BST: This whole Arturo Vidal thing is getting rather confusing. In a nutshell, there have been reports he wants to go but Juventus don't want to sell. There have been reports he doesn't want to go but Juve do want to sell. There have been reports Manchester United have offered huge pots of gold which Juve have turned away but are open to negotiationg. And most recently there were reports Vidal was enquired about by Utd some weeks ago but there has been nothing since. Confused? Yes I am too. No Arturo, we don't really know what is going on with your future either. Well the latest report from the Metro seems to think Manchester United have ploughed on with negotiations with Vidal's agent behind Juventus' back even though the Gazzetto Dello Sport reported the Bianconeri told Utd, hands off. It's like a soap opera. 10.20 BST: Mark Hughes is an ambitious man and fair play to him for that but trying to sign Eduardo may have been an ambition too far. According to a report in the Stoke Sentinel, the former Arsenal and Shakhtar Donetsk striker is set to join Brazilian side Flamengo on an 18-month deal. 10.16 BST: Another frustrated Chelsea youngster with a supposedly big future is Bertrand Traore. The Burkina Faso international spent last season on loan at Vitesse Arnhem and is set to return to the Dutch club as Chelsea have no room for him in their first team. Chelsea have now loaned seven players to Vitesse in the last 12 months: Traore, Wallace, Lucas Piazon, Patrick van Aanholt, Christian Atsu, Gael Kakuta and Sam Hutchinson. 10.11 BST: Tottenham are set to make an ambitious raid on Chelsea for £20 million striker Romelu Lukaku. The Belgian has told the club he wants to leave on a permanent deal and the Metro claim Spurs are seriously considering weighing up a bid. However, given the clubs' fractious relationship and Lukaku's desire to play in the Champions League, this one might not be as much of a goer as is being suggested. Romelu Lukaku has demanded a transfer from Chelsea and claims he wants to play for a Champions League club, putting half of Europe on alert in the process. 10.06 BST: After an excellent World Cup for the United States Men's National Team (official name) defender Matt Besler has attracted interest from around Europe. And according to Kicker, Bundesliga club Freiburg are very interested in signing the defender from Sporting Kansas City in the MLS. 10.01 BST: I told you there would be loads of Atleti news coming up. First Benfica goalkeeper Jan Oblak is close to signing after performing a no-show at Benfica's pre-season training. AS say a £16 million deal is close to being finalised. The same paper also claim Atleti will tie up a deal for Mario Mandzukic of Bayern after baulking at the £30 million asking price set for Alvaro Negredo at Manchester City. And it is not over yet. Atleti have also offered £25 million plus Leo Baptistao for Verona's Juan Iturbe who had been close to signing for Juventus just last week. The AS back pages working over-time. 9.57 BST:  Alvaro Morata is close to a move to Juventus from Real Madrid according to AS.  9.52 BST: There'll be plenty more Atletico Madrid updates this week with players expected to be coming and going. One such player we haven't heard much from is Christian Rodriguez. He spoke to El Pais in Uruguay and said, "Today what I want is to play. I was Liga champion and a finalist in the Champions League, but when you do not play, the taste is different. I feel that this trophy was not as deserved as I did not play." 9.46 BST: It's going on in Germany. Freiburg sporting director Klemens Hartenbach says "there are situations in which things can happen that have previously been ruled out," according to an interview in Badische Zeitung. Firstly, Borussia Dortmund have made one final offer for Matthias Ginter. And Freiburg are talking to Benfica's Stefan Mitrovic over a deal to replace the outgoing Ginter. 9.41 BST: Just because this is an incredible fact. Ross McCormack is now the 8th most expensive British striker in history behind Carroll, Rooney, Bent, Shearer, Fletcher, Sturridge & Fowler. - Andrew Haigh (@AndrewHaigh) July 8, 2014 9.40 BST: DONE DEAL! It has finally happened. The fee may be undisclosed but it is widely being reported as in the £10 million region. OFFICIAL: @Rossmccormack44 signs for Fulham. Welcome to the Club, Ross! http://t.co/wC0ta0jVwh #FFC pic.twitter.com/2IJGMFD6XR - Fulham Football Club (@FulhamFC) July 8, 2014 9.38 BST: In not quite so high profile Bayern Munich news, reserve goalkeeper Lukas Raeder has left the club on a free. According to TZ, he is set to join Vitoria Setubal in Portugal. 9.35 BST: It is getting to crunch-time for the Toni Kroos transfer to Real Madrid. According to TZ, Bayern Munich have withdrawn their contract offer to the midfielder who wanted to earn the same amount as Philip Lahm and Thomas Muller, believed to be around the £10 million mark. Claims in Spain clearly suggest the deal with Los Blancos is all but done with the Spanish giants offering him huge wages. Kroos wages at Real Madrid agreed at €12m, same as Gotze is on at Bayern. German club wanted to pay less than €7m. [Bild] - Sport Witness (@Sport_Witness) July 8, 2014 9.30 BST: Former Newcastle man Luuk de Jong, who might have been holding out hopes of a permanent deal with the Magpies following his loan and to join his brother Siem at St James' Park, is still set to leave Borussia Munchengladbach. But not for the bright lights of the north-east of England. According to Bild, he will sign a deal with PSV Eindhoven today with the fee believed to be somewhere between £5 million and £6 million. 9.24 BST: A quick update from Germany now as our man Stephan Uersfeld has told us Hertha Berlin and AZ Alkmaar are in a dispute over midfielder Roby Beerens. Hertha are unwilling to pay over £1.5 million while Alkmaar claim that is not enough for their man. Sporting director Michael Preetz told Kicker the Dutch club need to make a decision this week of "Otherwise, we will look elsewhere." He also confirmed the German club would not be signing Askhan Dejagah because he is too expensive. Askhan Dejagah won't be returning 'home' any time soon according to Hertha Berlin because he is too expensive. 9.21 BST: Almost two done deals for Inter Milan with our man in Italy, Ben Gladwell, reporting Yann M'Vila of Rubin Kazan and Dodo of Roma are set to join on one-year loan deals. The announcements are expected later today. 9.17 BST: Fiorentina just can't seem to catch a break at the moment. They're being pillaged for Juan Cuadrado but don't want to sell and now Alberto Aquilani's agent has told the press that talks over a new contract are on ice. Bad times to be a Viola fan... 9.10 BST: And finally our updates from Ian Holyman end with the news Olympiakos love French football. Or so it would seem. They've already signed Eric Abidal from Monaco and have decided to sign former teammate Delvin Ndinga from the French giants on a three-year deal following a successful loan spell last season. But it does not end there, oh no, with the news Mathieu Dossevi of Valenciennes has also joined the Greek Champions, as announced on his Twitter account (I am Greek and this roughly translates as " I am extremely happy that I am an Olympiakos player"). eimai poly xaroumenos pou eimai pektes apo olympiakos... #sorryforthemistakes #lol #olympiacos #newstart #athens #happiness #proud - Matthieu Dossevi (@MDossevi) July 7, 2014 You'd think that was enough but no, according to footmercato.net, Dossevi will be joined by teammate Arthur Masuaku in Piraeus too.  9.07 BST: In case you were asleep or doing something more interesting with your Monday evening, Manchester City announced the loaning out of promising young midfielder Marcos Lopes to Lille on a one-year deal. If you don't speak French, we promise this translates as "he's joined"... or thereabouts. À noter que @Rony10Lopes ne rejoindra le groupe qu'après l'Euro U19 (du 19 au 31/07) auquel il s'apprête à participer pic.twitter.com/pgdGxeO4Ho - LOSC (@losclive) July 7, 2014 9.05 BST: Marseille may be about to lose talisman Mathieu Valbuena to La Liga but what they'll lose in goals they're hoping to shore up in defence. The French giants are looking to bring in Norwegian international Vegard Forren from Molde. Marseille are looking at Norwegian international Vegard Forren as they seek to stiffen their defence. 9.00 BST: Our man in France Ian Holyman has updated us on a few of the rumours flying around across the Channel. And first of his nuggets is that Monaco are interested in CSKA Sofia prodigy Ivaylo Chochev, 21, who is also being pursued by Palermo of Serie A. 8.19 BST: A-League side Brisbane Roar have beefed up their squad, announcing two new signings today. Jamie Young returns to Queensland after plying his trade in the lower leagues of the UK for more than a decade, while Daniel Bowles his signed from fellow A-League club Adelaide United. Later Chelsea Hot on the heels of the Ashley Cole to Roma news -- which involves a 113,000 pounds-a-week pay cut, according to Tuesday's Sun -- the Daily Mail says another Chelsea pensioner could be about to join him. Samuel Eto'o has lucrative offers from China and Turkey to consider, but he'd rather keep things interesting and return to Italy, where he has already spent two fruitful years with Inter Milan. What's more, he's willing to follow Cole's lead and lower his salary to a mere 3 million pounds to push things through. How might that affect another Chelsea striker? Maybe not much. The Mirror says that Romelu Lukaku won't stomach another season on loan and instead wants to be playing Champions League football for a club at which he is permanently under contract. Who's Man City keeping? Joe Hart might have to set his sights elsewhere soon. Willy Caballero, the Argentinian goalkeeper, has touched down for a medical at Manchester City. The Manchester Evening News has pictures of him, well, walking, while the Guardian notes that Cabellero was signed by Manuel Pellegrini from Malaga and will not have arrived at the Etihad to be an also-ran. Any false moves of the type that let Costel Pantilimon in this past season, and Hart might face a far sterner task in getting his place back. Caballero was first linked with City a year ago -- slightly predictably, or so it seemed -- and now Pellegrini seems to have gotten his man. Do you play football? Then Arsenal wants you Arsenal, whose will-they-won't-they sagas make them firm favourites of any self-respecting transfer blog, seem about to move disappointingly early this time out, with the Guardian on the case again and reporting that their fee for Newcastle's Mathieu Debuchy will be a very precise 7.9 million pounds. That one should go through pretty quickly -- Debuchy is even breaking his holiday to see this through, which always sounds a more dramatic step than it is. The fun might not end there; a loan move for Costa Rica sensation Joel Campbell might water that fee down a little. Carl Jenkinson won't be used as part of the deal, though -- the same article says Newcastle have been offered one-time footballer Micah Richards to fill their right-back void but would rather plump for Daryl Janmaat or Ricardo van Rhijn. With the price looking right and both sides keen on a move, it seems Mathieu Debuchy to Arsenal from Newcastle is almost a done deal. And the Gunners might be in business again very soon indeed. Their pursuit of Alexis Sanchez is not exactly hot off the press, but more recent news is that things might get a little more straightforward now. The Liverpool Echo says Sanchez has been swayed by the capital's bright lights, and Brendan Rodgers' side is resigned to seeing him at Emirates Stadium next season. There's yet more -- kind of. Arsenal are among those that have been linked with Fiorentina and Colombia wide man Juan Cuadrado, but his club insist they are yet to receive any offers. However, their sporting director, Daniele Prade, doesn't sound overly optimistic about keeping his man and said in Tuttosport that, "We will do our best to make him stay with us". Atleti like Alex Witsel They might not quite have lived up to their billing at the World Cup, but Belgians still seem to be all the rage. Marca claims that Atletico Madrid are courting Axel Witsel, the midfield dynamo whose last action in Brazil was to volley a late half-chance over the bar against Argentina. It says Atleti would like him to complete their lineup in the centre of the park for next term -- and that they're in for his Zenit teammate, left-sided Argentinian player Cristian Ansaldi too. The prognosis? Mixed: Witsel cost Zenit 40 million euros and would not come cheaply this time either, while Ansaldi is said to be settled in Russia and would not be receptive to a proposed loan. Neymar who? In a parallel dimension, Neymar's back injury doesn't matter all that much to Brazil. Stepping in is one-time wunderkind Alexandre Pato, still just 24, and he slaloms past Per Mertesacker and Mats Hummels at will to remind the Brasileiros that he can be their darling too. In this particular time and place, though, Pato's career has hit the skids; he isn't in the World Cup squad and can be found whiling away his time agonisingly near to the action as a player with Sao Paolo. But is the ex-Milan forward's star back on the rise? Corriere Dello Sport says he is dreaming of a return to Italy -- and there is a chance he might get his wish, with former enemies Inter apparently sniffing around.	sports

Top Ten World Cup Semifinals - ESPN FC	With the World Cup in Brazil now at the semifinal stage, we look at 10 of the greatest semifinals from down the years. 10. Argentina 2-0 Belgium, 1986 It's a nice story to say that Diego Maradona won the World Cup on his own in 1986, but he of course had plenty of help -- their defence was strong, conceding only three goals before the final, while Jorge Valdano scored four goals and there were plenty of other top-drawer players in that team. That said, Maradona's performance that year was utterly extraordinary and is defined by two absurdly brilliant goals, the first the slaloming effort in the quarterfinal against England, the second another solo strike against Belgium in the semifinal, in which he picked up the ball 35 yards out and burst through a space that looked impossible to negotiate and smashed the ball home. In truth, this was a relatively routine victory for Argentina (as routine as a World Cup semifinal can be), but it displayed one of the greatest players the world has ever seen at the very peak of his powers, so for that reason alone deserves a place on this list. At His Peak: Maradona slaloms through the Belgian defence. 9. England 2-1 Portugal, 1966 The finest moment in English football history very nearly didn't happen -- or at least wouldn't have done if Eusebio had managed to complete an unlikely comeback in the semifinal. Bobby Charlton gave England the lead after half an hour, then doubled it with 10 minutes remaining, and Alf Ramsey's men began half-celebrating a place in the final. However, Eusebio scored a penalty a couple of minutes later, and a late onslaught very nearly took the game away from the English, but they managed to hold on thanks to some fine saves by Gordon Banks. Unlike England's bad-tempered win over Argentina in the quarterfinal, this was a game conducted in an atmosphere of mutual respect, so much so that Portuguese coach Otto Gloria congratulated the English after the game and correctly predicted they would win the final. "England plays football as it should be played. Germany relies on force," he said. 8. England 1-1 West Germany (West Germany won 4-3 on penalties), 1990 "It's the one thing, looking back, that I've got a tinge of disappointment about," Gary Lineker said a few years ago about the 1990 semifinal. "We were on the brink of getting to the final, and I think if we had got there, we would have been strong favourites. I had this conversation with him [Bobby Robson] once or twice. I remember the frustration, getting that close." This was of course more than just a single game in the story of English football, but a turning point in the rehabilitation of the sport after the stigmatised 1980s, and it perhaps says something about the English psyche that it took glorious failure to connect with the public at large. There were more than enough moments that those estranged from the game could identify with, from Lineker telling Robson to keep tabs on Paul Gascoigne after the yellow card that would put him out of the final, to the tears of Stuart Pearce and Chris Waddle. It was, of course, also a very exciting game, with Waddle inches away from putting England through without penalties, his extra-time shot crashing against the post. But for Lineker, Waddle, Pearce, Gascoigne and Robson, it will always be the great 'what if.' Paul Gascoigne, left, is consoled by teammate Steve McMahon after their semifinal penalty defeat. 7. Uruguay 6-1 Yugoslavia, 1930 Before the World Cup, the only real international football tournament was the Olympics, and in the years prior to 1930, Uruguay were the dominant force. They won the gold medal in 1924 and 1928, taking Yugoslavia apart on their way to the former, thrashing them 7-0, and they almost repeated the feat on a bigger stage in 1930. Yugoslavia actually took a surprise lead through Dorde Vujadinovic, but Uruguay quickly struck back through Pedro Cea then Peregrimo Anselmo, to go 2-1 up. However, the Yugoslavs were then the victim of some 'questionable' refereeing, as Brazilian official Gilberto de Almeida Rego firstly denied them a goal by an offside flag that we shall simply say 'could have gone either way,' then Uruguay scored a goal after the ball went out of play only to be put straight back in by a watching policeman. Uruguay went on to run away with the match, Cea scoring another couple to complete his hat trick, and, of course, went on to lift the first World Cup with a victory over Argentina in the final. 6. Germany 0-2 Italy, 2006 Winning the 2006 World Cup was a matter of hope rather than expectation for Germany. Sure, they had made the final in 2002, but they had limped out of the 2004 European Championships at the first-round stage without winning a game, and the brilliant generation of players who currently populate the side had yet to come through. Still, they made it to the semifinal, where they played Italy in a throbbing Westfalenstadion in Dortmund, and 118 minutes of goalless tension meant that penalties seemed inevitable. Then, Fabio Grosso, of all people, swept in a remarkable deadlock-breaker, before Alessandro del Piero, appearing as if from nowhere on a counter-attack as Germany desperately looked for an equaliser, finished it off. "I am drunk with joy," said Grosso after the game. "I haven't got much to say only that it is a victory for a strong group of people." Fabio Grosso, right, celebrates his unlikely match winner against World Cup hosts Germany. 5. Brazil 4-2 Chile, 1962 The 1962 World Cup was one of remarkable violence, of course most famously in the game between Chile and Italy in the first round. However, it would permeate the whole tournament, and not least in the semifinal between the hosts and the defending champions, when Chile tried to kick Garrincha, Brazil's star in the absence of the injured Pele and their player of the tournament, out of the game. That didn't work, but it did succeed in riling the bow-legged genius so much that after 83 minutes of fouls, he finally snapped and booted Chile midfielder Eladio Rojas in the stomach, for which he was, of course, sent off. Brazil launched a rather optimistic appeal on the basis that Garrincha had been goaded by the crowd, and remarkably it worked, and he was allowed to play in the final. Garrincha had given Brazil the lead with two first-half goals, Chile pulled one back through Jorge Toro, before a couple from Vava sealed the victory despite one more comeback attempt through a goal by Leonel Sanchez. 4. Hungary 4-2 Uruguay 1954 The progress of Hungary in the 1954 World Cup is often painted as a breeze all the way until the final, where they were defeated by West Germany in the 'miracle of Bern,' but that isn't quite the case. For a start, they were without Ferenc Puskas for the quarter and semifinal, after he was hobbled by a rake to his Achilles in the group game against the Germans. In the semifinal against defending champions Uruguay, Zoltan Czibor and Nandor Hidegkuti put them ahead, and it looked like they would cruise through to the final until Juan Hohberg scored in the 75th and 86th minutes to level things. So excited and exhausted was Hohberg that he fainted after the second strike and had to be revived by the attendant first-aiders. The game went to extra-time, where Sandor Koscis bagged two quick goals, and this time the Magyars held on and made the final, where most expected them to lift the trophy, only for one of the most extraordinary upsets in World Cup history to deny them. Sandor Kocsis celebrates as the ball rolls past Uruguayan goalkeeper Gaston Roque Maspoli into the net. 3. Brazil 5-2 France, 1958 Pele nearly didn't make it to the 1958 World Cup, a knee injury putting his selection in serious doubt until his teammates insisted on him travelling to Sweden. He didn't play in the first two games and appeared but didn't score in the third before netting the winner in Brazil's quarterfinal victory over Wales. However, he truly announced his arrival in the semifinal against France, scoring a second-half hat trick to give Brazil an emphatic 5-2 victory and a place in the final, where Pele would cement his status as the newest superstar in world football. It takes something for a player to eclipse another who scored 13 goals at a World Cup, but 1958 will always be known as Pele's tournament, not Just Fontaine's. 2. West Germany 3-3 France (West Germany win 5-4 on penalties), 1982 This game is, of course, best remembered for Harald Schumacher's assault on Patrick Battiston, and while football always likes a bogeyman to point at and scorn, it is rather a shame that the rest of the match isn't remembered quite so fondly, for it was a corker. "That was my most beautiful game," said Michel Platini, which from a man who won five league titles, the European Cup and the European Championships, is quite a statement. "What happened in those two hours encapsulated all the sentiments of life itself. No film or play could ever recapture so many contradictions and emotions. It was complete. So strong. It was fabulous." Pierre Litbarski gave the Germans the lead after 18 minutes, but shortly after Platini equalised from the penalty spot, and that's how it stayed until full time. France then looked like they had the game in the bag after extra-time goals by Marius Tresor and Alain Giresse, only for Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Karl Fischer with a bicycle kick to level things. The teams missed one penalty apiece in the initial five in the shootout, before Schumacher, who of course should not have been on the pitch, saved from Didier Six, and the Germans were in the final. West German goalkeeper Harald Schumacher, right, jumps past the ball as he gets ready to collide with French defender Patrick Battiston. 1. West Germany 3-4 Italy, 1970 Many will argue that this is the greatest World Cup match full stop, never mind the best semifinal; indeed, so astonishing was it that to this day there remains a plaque commemorating the occasion outside the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City. Roberto Boninsegna put the Italians ahead early on, and utilising their brilliant and sometimes brutal defence, led by Giacinto Facchetti, they tried to shut up shop, holding on until the final minute when Karl-Heinz Schnellinger equalised for the Germans. Gerd Muller then scored four minutes into extra time, then Italy took the lead through Tarcisio Burgnich and Gigi Riva, before Muller scored again, only for Gianni Rivera to score the winner just a minute later. Of course, Franz Beckenbauer dislocated his shoulder in the second half, but because the Germans had already made both permitted substitutions, he had to play on, arm strapped across his chest like a striding, 6-foot Napoleon. The Italians would go on to put up only half a fight in the final, losing 4-1 to Brazil, the stuffing, energy and spirit knocked out of them by this most bruising of encounters.	sports
Tim Vickery explores if Alejandro Sabella is an artist or artisan - ESPN FC	For years, Argentine football was defined by a battle for its soul between two rival schools of thought. There was that of Cesar Luis Menotti, a left-leaning intellectual, coach of the team who won the World Cup in 1978, who saw football as art. In the other corner was the camp of Carlos Bilardo, a World Cup-winning coach in 1986, for whom football is war and winning is the only objective. Curiously, Alejandro Sabella's 2014 team might be seen as straddling both sides, with an identity that incorporates bits of both, lurching back and forth between the two. Sabella was thrown in the deep end in 2011, appointed just before the start of the World Cup qualifiers and given an obvious mission -- get the best out of Lionel Messi, the little genius who had consistently failed to show his club form for his country. The new coach got off to a sticky start. Argentina had been beaten by Venezuela and held at home by Bolivia. They were then losing away to Colombia until Sergio Aguero was introduced at the interval and, together with Messi, turned the game around. Sabella found himself inching toward a 4-3-3 formation, with Messi operating behind two strikers, Aguero and Gonzalo Higuain. Behind Messi, there was a midfield trio, made up of three players with very different functions. Javier Mascherano protected the fort, Fernando Gago passed the ball (usually to Messi) and Angel Di Maria provided left-footed attacking thrust. There was an obvious similarity here with Menotti's 1978 side. True, then there was no Messi, and the attacking trio was totally different -- a centre-forward and two wingers rather than a pair of genuine strikers and a false nine/playmaker. But there was a striking similarity about the midfield three; 36 years ago Americo Gallego was the tough little tackler who rarely crossed the halfway line, Osvaldo Ardiles knitted the team together with his high-tempo passing, and Mario Kempes was the left-footed "matador," a constant threat with his attacking runs from deep. Netherlands vs. Argentina: July 9, 4 ET (ESPN and WatchESPN) - Stats: Diego Maradona vs. Lionel Messi - McIntyre: Superstars collide in Messi vs. Robben - Brewin: Van Gaal's management style - Brassell: Semifinalists have much to lose - Honigstein: Kuyt an unsung hero for the Dutch - Cox: Key semifinal matchups - Marcotti: Then there were four at the World Cup - Five Aside: Dutch, Argentina look to overcome past There was always a feeling that Sabella was concerned that the 4-3-3 formation left his team too open. "There are times when the opposition are attacking," he commented last year, "when all I can do is shut my eyes and pray." Argentina's coach seemed to lose his nerve when he arrived in Brazil. For the opening game against Bosnia he went with an ultra-cautious system with three centre-backs. It was a disaster, and after a dismal first 45 minutes he was obliged to revert to 4-3-3 at halftime. After the match Messi made it clear that this was his preferred way of playing, and that seemed to have settled the matter. But never underestimate the importance of what former British Prime Minister Harold MacMillan once referred to as "events, dear boy." In this case, the events were injuries to a couple of key members of the team. Aguero, who had never looked 100 percent, limped off in the third game against Nigeria and has yet to return -- though he could come off the bench in the semifinal against the Dutch. And then, in the quarterfinal against Belgium, Di Maria was a casualty. He will certainly miss the match against Holland. Alejandro Sabella's team lurches back and forth between being both creative and combative. Aguero was replaced by Ezequiel Lavezzi. This may have appeared a like-for-like switch, one striker for another. In reality, it was a big change. Aguero is a penalty-box predator, Lavezzi a winger. The new man patrolled the flank, and was happy to track back into midfield. In effect, Argentina were now playing 4-4-2, with Messi and Higuain up front and Lavezzi and Di Maria on the flanks, frequently swapping wings. The loss of Di Maria tends to emphasise this change further. The most likely scenario is one in which Enzo Perez starts the match against Holland -- he did well after coming on for Di Maria on Saturday. Perez is a player of considerable dynamism, but there is no doubt that his inclusion further tilts the balance of the midfield toward defence. Suddenly, we are a long way from the open 4-3-3, which Messi enjoys so much. In fact, we are moving closer to the Bilardo formula of 1986. This is not an exact comparison; Bilardo was a pioneer of the three-centre-back system, while Sabella's team still look more likely to take the field in Sao Paulo with a back four. But there is a similarity in the basic idea: keep compact, have numbers behind the ball and trust in the flashes of inspiration from a genius at No. 10, Diego Maradona in 1986, and Lionel Messi 26 years later.

Perez is a player of considerable dynamism, but there is no doubt that his inclusion further tilts the balance of the midfield toward defence. Suddenly, we are a long way from the open 4-3-3, which Messi enjoys so much. In fact, we are moving closer to the Bilardo formula of 1986. This is not an exact comparison; Bilardo was a pioneer of the three-centre-back system, while Sabella's team still look more likely to take the field in Sao Paulo with a back four.

Small margins for Argentina and Netherlands at the World Cup - ESPN FC	Memories of 1978's final and Dennis Bergkamp's goal at France in 1998 flooded back as soon as Netherlands and Argentina were paired for Sao Paulo's semifinal World Cup match. Both might have a sense of owing the other one. The Dutch's progress to this stage would seem a shock when considering that many thought they would struggle to get out of Group B. But since a 5-1 devastation of Spain, they have held themselves together, and despite slackening off from the fireworks of Salvador, have negotiated two troublesome assignments in Mexico and Costa Rica. Netherlands vs. Argentina: July 9, 4 ET (ESPN and WatchESPN) - Stats: Diego Maradona vs. Lionel Messi - McIntyre: Superstars collide in Messi vs. Robben - Brewin: Van Gaal's management style - Brassell: Semifinalists have much to lose - Honigstein: Kuyt an unsung hero for the Dutch - Cox: Key semifinal matchups - Marcotti: Then there were four at the World Cup - Five Aside: Dutch, Argentina look to overcome past There is, however, the possibility that the Dutch trajectory -- they do seem a little weary -- may be going in the opposite direction to Argentina, whose victory over Belgium was collected with ease. This time Lionel Messi was not the match winner, though -- as expected -- his movements made the whole thing possible. GOALKEEPER This has suddenly become an area of increased interest. Jasper Cillessen has done just fine in normal play for the Dutch, only to be replaced by Tim Krul as Louis van Gaal introduced his version of the baseball "closer." This was Krul's big moment and he grasped it with both hands, going the right way each time a Costa Rican took his kick. The likelihood is that Cillessen will return to his normal job. Or else, Van Gaal is even more ruthless than we thought. Sergio Romero, meanwhile, may well be the lesser goalkeeper left in the tournament, with due nod to Julio Cesar. He has not completely convinced in Brazil, though his showing as Iran piled on the pressure in a group-stage match was as much a match-winner as Messi proved. Still, he has the full faith of Alejandro Sabella, just as he had when Diego Maradona was coach in 2010. Edge: Netherlands Although subbed off for the penalty shoot-out against Costa Rica, Jasper Cillessen is expected to start for the Netherlands in the semifinal. DEFENCE Premier League fans may not be able to believe it, but the injury worry against Ron Vlaar may prove crucial. The Aston Villa stopper has been a relative rock amid a defence that has never looked truly solid. His experience would be missed in Arena Corinthians as the rest of the bunch are callow and far rawer. As ever with Dutch teams, the players are expected to be versatile, and "LVG" may either try a four- or three-man defence. More surprise for Premier League followers: Martin Demichelis' addition made Argentina look more solid than they had for their previous four matches. He is likely to keep his place ahead of Federico Fernandez, while Marcos Rojo, back from suspension, should replace Jose Basanta, who did well enough in Brasilia. Much still depends on the leadership of Ezequiel Garay, and the dedication of Pablo Zabaleta. Edge: Argentina Marcos Rojo, left, and Ezequiel Garay, right, will be relied upon to keep the formidable Dutch attack quiet. MIDFIELDERS The Dutch midfield is all about providing a platform for the three main men to perform, which is not too different from Argentina's approach. Daley Blind, versatile enough to play both defence and midfield, plays as the holder in the absence of Nigel De Jong and he, Georginio Wijnaldum and the redoubtable Dirk Kuyt, who played at left-back against Chile, do the work for Wesley Sneijder to try and create. The absence of Angel di Maria would clearly be a hindrance to Argentina. It is the Real Madrid speedster's running that has been the best counterpoint to Messi. Without him, Argentina's midfield looks like a collection of holders, and without pace. Enzo Perez did fine against the Belgians but the Dutch may increase the need for a greater dynamism. Edge: Netherlands The versatility of Daley Blind has been pivotal for Louis van Gaal. FORWARDS Robin van Persie has slowed down from the brilliance of his performance on the first Friday of the tournament. A series of tough visits to some hot locations around Brazil has not helped him return to the sharpness he showed back then. It has left a considerable burden on Arjen Robben, a leading contender for player of the tournament, but under which this flying Dutchman has flourished. He is certain to be key in Sao Paulo. Lionel Messi, then. We know all about him, but can he be stopped? It may end up being the leading question of World Cup 2014. The Dutch cause may not have been helped by Gonzalo Higuain finally locating his scoring touch in Brasilia, though a loose second-half finish suggested that he is not yet totally deadly. Sergio Aguero is likely to come from the bench, though Sabella suggested on Sunday he has made an "excellent" recovery from his latest muscle problem. Edge: Argentina Sergio Aguero's return from injury could prove timely for Argentina. RESERVES Van Gaal is not blessed with riches beyond his first-team selections, though he has made use of most of his squad -- even the reserve goalie, of course. He has been well served by his subs so far, in fact, with Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scoring the match-winning penalty against Mexico after replacing Van Persie. Sergio Aguero might prove to be a high-grade super-sub for Sabella in Sao Paulo. Sabella has options in attack and midfield with the likes of Rodrigo Palacio, Maxi Rodriguez and Ricky Alvarez. Few of them provide a true variation from what Sabella chooses to start with, though Palacio's switch to midfield against Switzerland did produce Di Maria's winning goal. Edge: Argentina Alejandro Sabella may have to rely on his bench to get Argentina over the line on Wednesday. COACHES Van Gaal is happy to assume credit for his team's successes so far, but then again he probably deserves it, too. No coach in the tournament has shown off such a varied set of formations and tactics, and few are willing to take on such tough calls like those Huntelaar and Krul introductions. Sabella is a strange cove given to talking deep philosophical doggerel in his news conferences. He clearly feels the deep pressure that an expectant nation places on him. Last week he complained that too many back home think his team should win. His furrowed brow is usually on show, as it was when he performed that falling-back exasperation at a Higuain miss that became an instant Vine hit. He has done well in getting Argentina to the semis for the first time since 1990, but looks as if he needs a long holiday. Edge: Netherlands Louis van Gaal cuts an imposing figure both in the dressing room and on the sidelines. INTANGIBLES Both these countries have had, over the years, the ability to come apart at the seams at the wrong time. Sao Paulo may see one of them -- or possibly both -- do just that. There is a sense that the Dutch have hit their target while Argentina and Messi in particular think the World Cup is on. A blue and white backing to the tune of Creedence Clearwater Revival is sure to be heard as the noisy neighbours descend on Brazil's biggest city. PREDICTION Argentina victory, with Messi at the centre. A predictable prediction, perhaps.	sports
Tim Vickery explores if Alejandro Sabella is an artist or artisan - ESPN FC	For years, Argentine football was defined by a battle for its soul between two rival schools of thought. There was that of Cesar Luis Menotti, a left-leaning intellectual, coach of the team who won the World Cup in 1978, who saw football as art. In the other corner was the camp of Carlos Bilardo, a World Cup-winning coach in 1986, for whom football is war and winning is the only objective. Curiously, Alejandro Sabella's 2014 team might be seen as straddling both sides, with an identity that incorporates bits of both, lurching back and forth between the two. Sabella was thrown in the deep end in 2011, appointed just before the start of the World Cup qualifiers and given an obvious mission -- get the best out of Lionel Messi, the little genius who had consistently failed to show his club form for his country. The new coach got off to a sticky start. Argentina had been beaten by Venezuela and held at home by Bolivia. They were then losing away to Colombia until Sergio Aguero was introduced at the interval and, together with Messi, turned the game around. Sabella found himself inching toward a 4-3-3 formation, with Messi operating behind two strikers, Aguero and Gonzalo Higuain. Behind Messi, there was a midfield trio, made up of three players with very different functions. Javier Mascherano protected the fort, Fernando Gago passed the ball (usually to Messi) and Angel Di Maria provided left-footed attacking thrust. There was an obvious similarity here with Menotti's 1978 side. True, then there was no Messi, and the attacking trio was totally different -- a centre-forward and two wingers rather than a pair of genuine strikers and a false nine/playmaker. But there was a striking similarity about the midfield three; 36 years ago Americo Gallego was the tough little tackler who rarely crossed the halfway line, Osvaldo Ardiles knitted the team together with his high-tempo passing, and Mario Kempes was the left-footed "matador," a constant threat with his attacking runs from deep. Netherlands vs. Argentina: July 9, 4 ET (ESPN and WatchESPN) - Stats: Diego Maradona vs. Lionel Messi - McIntyre: Superstars collide in Messi vs. Robben - Brewin: Van Gaal's management style - Brassell: Semifinalists have much to lose - Honigstein: Kuyt an unsung hero for the Dutch - Cox: Key semifinal matchups - Marcotti: Then there were four at the World Cup - Five Aside: Dutch, Argentina look to overcome past There was always a feeling that Sabella was concerned that the 4-3-3 formation left his team too open. "There are times when the opposition are attacking," he commented last year, "when all I can do is shut my eyes and pray." Argentina's coach seemed to lose his nerve when he arrived in Brazil. For the opening game against Bosnia he went with an ultra-cautious system with three centre-backs. It was a disaster, and after a dismal first 45 minutes he was obliged to revert to 4-3-3 at halftime. After the match Messi made it clear that this was his preferred way of playing, and that seemed to have settled the matter. But never underestimate the importance of what former British Prime Minister Harold MacMillan once referred to as "events, dear boy." In this case, the events were injuries to a couple of key members of the team. Aguero, who had never looked 100 percent, limped off in the third game against Nigeria and has yet to return -- though he could come off the bench in the semifinal against the Dutch. And then, in the quarterfinal against Belgium, Di Maria was a casualty. He will certainly miss the match against Holland. Alejandro Sabella's team lurches back and forth between being both creative and combative. Aguero was replaced by Ezequiel Lavezzi. This may have appeared a like-for-like switch, one striker for another. In reality, it was a big change. Aguero is a penalty-box predator, Lavezzi a winger. The new man patrolled the flank, and was happy to track back into midfield. In effect, Argentina were now playing 4-4-2, with Messi and Higuain up front and Lavezzi and Di Maria on the flanks, frequently swapping wings. The loss of Di Maria tends to emphasise this change further. The most likely scenario is one in which Enzo Perez starts the match against Holland -- he did well after coming on for Di Maria on Saturday. Perez is a player of considerable dynamism, but there is no doubt that his inclusion further tilts the balance of the midfield toward defence. Suddenly, we are a long way from the open 4-3-3, which Messi enjoys so much. In fact, we are moving closer to the Bilardo formula of 1986. This is not an exact comparison; Bilardo was a pioneer of the three-centre-back system, while Sabella's team still look more likely to take the field in Sao Paulo with a back four.

Alfredo Di Stefano: 1926-2014 - ESPN FC	Perhaps the best summary of the talent of Real Madrid legend Alfredo Di Stefano came from Brazilian star Didí when asked to compare the Argentine and Pelé, both of whom he played with: "Edson is Pelé 10 minutes per match; Alfredo is Di Stefano all 90 of them." When Di Stéfano arrived in Madrid in 1953, he was already a well-established player. At the age of 28, he had played and impressed in his native Argentina, where he had won the Championship with River Plate and the Copa America with the national team. But in 1949 a players' strike stopped the Argentinean Championship and most stars left for Colombia, including Di Stefano, loaned by River Plate to Millonarios de Bogota. There, Di Stefano won four titles in four years. In fact, the Blond Arrow and his teammates became as globally popular as it was possible to be back then, as the aptly nicknamed Ballet Azul (Blue Ballet) -- with Di Stefano, Nestor Rossi, Julio Cozzi and Adolfo Pedernera at its heart -- received constant invitations to play abroad. One of those trips, in 1952, took them to the Bernabeu for Real Madrid's 50th anniversary tournament; Millonarios demolished the hosts 4-2 and it was then that Real president Santiago Bernabeu fell in love with Di Stefano for the first time. He was not the only one, though. Barcelona also wanted the Argentinean and, while Real Madrid courted Millonarios, the Catalans negotiated with the original owners of Di Stefano's rights: River Plate. Thus the most controversial signing in Spanish football history was born, and with it the best known rivalry in Spanish football. The debate continues nowadays as though no time had passed: both clubs still claim to be right. Each signed their respective contracts with Millonarios and River and, after months of arguments that left the player anxiously waiting in Barcelona, in September of 1953 the Spanish FA decided to have Di Stefano play one season for each team during four seasons, starting in the Les Corts -- the Camp Nou's predecessor. Shortly thereafter, in a move that still sparks conspiracy theories, Barcelona sold its rights over the player to Real Madrid. Di Stefano said several times that Barcelona lost interest in him after his first two matches with the Azulgrana showed the toll that six months of no real football had taken on his legs, but the real reasons for his move to Madrid may never be known. Once the chance of forging an amazing partnership with Ladislao Kubala in Barcelona was off the table, the Blond Arrow turned a mediocre Real Madrid, who had gone 20 years without winning a single title in Spain, into one of the best teams ever. He gave the club a crash course in winning, and completely changed its status in both Spanish and European football. In 11 seasons, Di Stefano and the Merengues won eight Liga titles, one Copa del Rey and five consecutive European Cups. He scored relentlessly -- won five scoring titles, reaching 307 goals in 403 matches -- and led by example with amazing dedication, playing every game with unprecedented intensity. On top of that, Di Stefano never restricted his work to the pitch, as he helped to select and hire a handful of players like Jose Emilio Santamaria or Hector Rial, who became instrumental in Real Madrid's decade of dominance. His continuous success with Real Madrid contrasts remarkably with his frustrating record with his two national teams. Argentina did not play the World Cups of 1950 and 1954 while Spain -- he had become a Spanish national in 1956 -- failed to qualify for 1958 and Di Stefano picked up an injury right before the 1962 World Cup (he made the trip to Chile, but did not play). He ended up scoring 23 goals in 31 matches for Spain, but never made the kind of impact he managed in domestic football with La Furia. Indeed, goals and titles with Real Madrid made him grow into a national celebrity in Spain, and he expanded his range of activities. Di Stefano became a pioneer in advertising among sportsmen, endorsing several brands and profiting enormously from it. He even took part in three movies -- Con los mismos colores (1949), Once pares de botas (1954), La batalla del domingo (1963) -- always in one of those "as himself" roles, as his popularity skyrocketed. There are many moments from his career which deserve to be remembered, but its pinnacle could well have happened at Hampden Park, where he scored a hat trick and dominated both offensively and defensively what has become widely considered the best match ever played: Real Madrid's 7-3 win over Eintracht Frankfurt in the 1960 European Cup final. Di Stefano never appeared at the World Cup during a wonderful career. As his physical decline started, the unforgiving president Santiago Bernabeu -- not that long ago his partner in the construction of a sports empire -- forced him to finish his career somewhere else, leaving the Madridistas angry at the treatment of their former idol. Di Stefano did end up playing his last two seasons in Barcelona, but for Espanyol. He retired at age 40, and quickly started to work as a coach; never as successful as his previous decades as a player, but with an impressive experience in any case. He managed nine clubs, including Real Madrid, twice; Valencia, three times; and amazingly enough both Argentine rivals Boca Juniors AND River Plate, whom he took to national titles. In 2000, current Real Madrid president Florentino Perez gave Di Stefano the title of President of Honour. The Argentinean became a de facto ambassador for Real Madrid, his first duty being the reception of FIFA's prize to the Best Club of the 20th Century, an award that could have not possibly happened without him. His titles, but especially his will to win -- a trait Real Madrid kept after he left -- transformed the club into the global powerhouse that it has become nowadays. Di Stefano's greatness can indeed be measured in the amazing amount of trophies he won, in the goals he scored season after season, but especially in the current size of the club he so decisively helped to build. He deserves to be considered one of the best ever; among the very exclusive list that contains the likes of Pele, Diego Maradona and Johan Cruyff.	sports

Top Ten World Cup Semifinals - ESPN FC	With the World Cup in Brazil now at the semifinal stage, we look at 10 of the greatest semifinals from down the years. 10. Argentina 2-0 Belgium, 1986 It's a nice story to say that Diego Maradona won the World Cup on his own in 1986, but he of course had plenty of help -- their defence was strong, conceding only three goals before the final, while Jorge Valdano scored four goals and there were plenty of other top-drawer players in that team. That said, Maradona's performance that year was utterly extraordinary and is defined by two absurdly brilliant goals, the first the slaloming effort in the quarterfinal against England, the second another solo strike against Belgium in the semifinal, in which he picked up the ball 35 yards out and burst through a space that looked impossible to negotiate and smashed the ball home. In truth, this was a relatively routine victory for Argentina (as routine as a World Cup semifinal can be), but it displayed one of the greatest players the world has ever seen at the very peak of his powers, so for that reason alone deserves a place on this list. At His Peak: Maradona slaloms through the Belgian defence. 9. England 2-1 Portugal, 1966 The finest moment in English football history very nearly didn't happen -- or at least wouldn't have done if Eusebio had managed to complete an unlikely comeback in the semifinal. Bobby Charlton gave England the lead after half an hour, then doubled it with 10 minutes remaining, and Alf Ramsey's men began half-celebrating a place in the final. However, Eusebio scored a penalty a couple of minutes later, and a late onslaught very nearly took the game away from the English, but they managed to hold on thanks to some fine saves by Gordon Banks. Unlike England's bad-tempered win over Argentina in the quarterfinal, this was a game conducted in an atmosphere of mutual respect, so much so that Portuguese coach Otto Gloria congratulated the English after the game and correctly predicted they would win the final. "England plays football as it should be played. Germany relies on force," he said. 8. England 1-1 West Germany (West Germany won 4-3 on penalties), 1990 "It's the one thing, looking back, that I've got a tinge of disappointment about," Gary Lineker said a few years ago about the 1990 semifinal. "We were on the brink of getting to the final, and I think if we had got there, we would have been strong favourites. I had this conversation with him [Bobby Robson] once or twice. I remember the frustration, getting that close." This was of course more than just a single game in the story of English football, but a turning point in the rehabilitation of the sport after the stigmatised 1980s, and it perhaps says something about the English psyche that it took glorious failure to connect with the public at large. There were more than enough moments that those estranged from the game could identify with, from Lineker telling Robson to keep tabs on Paul Gascoigne after the yellow card that would put him out of the final, to the tears of Stuart Pearce and Chris Waddle. It was, of course, also a very exciting game, with Waddle inches away from putting England through without penalties, his extra-time shot crashing against the post. But for Lineker, Waddle, Pearce, Gascoigne and Robson, it will always be the great 'what if.' Paul Gascoigne, left, is consoled by teammate Steve McMahon after their semifinal penalty defeat. 7. Uruguay 6-1 Yugoslavia, 1930 Before the World Cup, the only real international football tournament was the Olympics, and in the years prior to 1930, Uruguay were the dominant force. They won the gold medal in 1924 and 1928, taking Yugoslavia apart on their way to the former, thrashing them 7-0, and they almost repeated the feat on a bigger stage in 1930. Yugoslavia actually took a surprise lead through Dorde Vujadinovic, but Uruguay quickly struck back through Pedro Cea then Peregrimo Anselmo, to go 2-1 up. However, the Yugoslavs were then the victim of some 'questionable' refereeing, as Brazilian official Gilberto de Almeida Rego firstly denied them a goal by an offside flag that we shall simply say 'could have gone either way,' then Uruguay scored a goal after the ball went out of play only to be put straight back in by a watching policeman. Uruguay went on to run away with the match, Cea scoring another couple to complete his hat trick, and, of course, went on to lift the first World Cup with a victory over Argentina in the final. 6. Germany 0-2 Italy, 2006 Winning the 2006 World Cup was a matter of hope rather than expectation for Germany. Sure, they had made the final in 2002, but they had limped out of the 2004 European Championships at the first-round stage without winning a game, and the brilliant generation of players who currently populate the side had yet to come through. Still, they made it to the semifinal, where they played Italy in a throbbing Westfalenstadion in Dortmund, and 118 minutes of goalless tension meant that penalties seemed inevitable. Then, Fabio Grosso, of all people, swept in a remarkable deadlock-breaker, before Alessandro del Piero, appearing as if from nowhere on a counter-attack as Germany desperately looked for an equaliser, finished it off. "I am drunk with joy," said Grosso after the game. "I haven't got much to say only that it is a victory for a strong group of people." Fabio Grosso, right, celebrates his unlikely match winner against World Cup hosts Germany. 5. Brazil 4-2 Chile, 1962 The 1962 World Cup was one of remarkable violence, of course most famously in the game between Chile and Italy in the first round. However, it would permeate the whole tournament, and not least in the semifinal between the hosts and the defending champions, when Chile tried to kick Garrincha, Brazil's star in the absence of the injured Pele and their player of the tournament, out of the game. That didn't work, but it did succeed in riling the bow-legged genius so much that after 83 minutes of fouls, he finally snapped and booted Chile midfielder Eladio Rojas in the stomach, for which he was, of course, sent off. Brazil launched a rather optimistic appeal on the basis that Garrincha had been goaded by the crowd, and remarkably it worked, and he was allowed to play in the final. Garrincha had given Brazil the lead with two first-half goals, Chile pulled one back through Jorge Toro, before a couple from Vava sealed the victory despite one more comeback attempt through a goal by Leonel Sanchez. 4. Hungary 4-2 Uruguay 1954 The progress of Hungary in the 1954 World Cup is often painted as a breeze all the way until the final, where they were defeated by West Germany in the 'miracle of Bern,' but that isn't quite the case. For a start, they were without Ferenc Puskas for the quarter and semifinal, after he was hobbled by a rake to his Achilles in the group game against the Germans. In the semifinal against defending champions Uruguay, Zoltan Czibor and Nandor Hidegkuti put them ahead, and it looked like they would cruise through to the final until Juan Hohberg scored in the 75th and 86th minutes to level things. So excited and exhausted was Hohberg that he fainted after the second strike and had to be revived by the attendant first-aiders. The game went to extra-time, where Sandor Koscis bagged two quick goals, and this time the Magyars held on and made the final, where most expected them to lift the trophy, only for one of the most extraordinary upsets in World Cup history to deny them. Sandor Kocsis celebrates as the ball rolls past Uruguayan goalkeeper Gaston Roque Maspoli into the net. 3. Brazil 5-2 France, 1958 Pele nearly didn't make it to the 1958 World Cup, a knee injury putting his selection in serious doubt until his teammates insisted on him travelling to Sweden. He didn't play in the first two games and appeared but didn't score in the third before netting the winner in Brazil's quarterfinal victory over Wales. However, he truly announced his arrival in the semifinal against France, scoring a second-half hat trick to give Brazil an emphatic 5-2 victory and a place in the final, where Pele would cement his status as the newest superstar in world football. It takes something for a player to eclipse another who scored 13 goals at a World Cup, but 1958 will always be known as Pele's tournament, not Just Fontaine's. 2. West Germany 3-3 France (West Germany win 5-4 on penalties), 1982 This game is, of course, best remembered for Harald Schumacher's assault on Patrick Battiston, and while football always likes a bogeyman to point at and scorn, it is rather a shame that the rest of the match isn't remembered quite so fondly, for it was a corker. "That was my most beautiful game," said Michel Platini, which from a man who won five league titles, the European Cup and the European Championships, is quite a statement. "What happened in those two hours encapsulated all the sentiments of life itself. No film or play could ever recapture so many contradictions and emotions. It was complete. So strong. It was fabulous." Pierre Litbarski gave the Germans the lead after 18 minutes, but shortly after Platini equalised from the penalty spot, and that's how it stayed until full time. France then looked like they had the game in the bag after extra-time goals by Marius Tresor and Alain Giresse, only for Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Karl Fischer with a bicycle kick to level things. The teams missed one penalty apiece in the initial five in the shootout, before Schumacher, who of course should not have been on the pitch, saved from Didier Six, and the Germans were in the final. West German goalkeeper Harald Schumacher, right, jumps past the ball as he gets ready to collide with French defender Patrick Battiston. 1. West Germany 3-4 Italy, 1970 Many will argue that this is the greatest World Cup match full stop, never mind the best semifinal; indeed, so astonishing was it that to this day there remains a plaque commemorating the occasion outside the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City. Roberto Boninsegna put the Italians ahead early on, and utilising their brilliant and sometimes brutal defence, led by Giacinto Facchetti, they tried to shut up shop, holding on until the final minute when Karl-Heinz Schnellinger equalised for the Germans. Gerd Muller then scored four minutes into extra time, then Italy took the lead through Tarcisio Burgnich and Gigi Riva, before Muller scored again, only for Gianni Rivera to score the winner just a minute later. Of course, Franz Beckenbauer dislocated his shoulder in the second half, but because the Germans had already made both permitted substitutions, he had to play on, arm strapped across his chest like a striding, 6-foot Napoleon. The Italians would go on to put up only half a fight in the final, losing 4-1 to Brazil, the stuffing, energy and spirit knocked out of them by this most bruising of encounters.	sports
Alfredo Di Stefano: South America's greatest footballer - ESPN FC	There is one question that a writer on South American football can never escape: Who was better, Pele or Diego Maradona? It is not a debate I usually enjoy. The two were obviously extraordinarily gifted players, who gave pleasure to millions and who belong to all humanity. Points can be made in favour of both, without any need for the tone to become adversarial. But all too often the discussion degenerates into an infantile nationalist slanging match. To avoid being involved, I have come out with a defence strategy. Question: Who is the greatest of all time, Pele or Maradona? Answer: Alfredo Di Stefano. Certainly it is hard to think of any player who proved more influential than Di Stefano. One of the last products of the golden age of Argentine football in the 1940s, he played a major role in getting the professional game in Colombia off the ground -- and then, 60 years ago, he embarked on a process that would transform the global game, and maybe even the political history of Europe. It was on September 23, 1953, that Di Stefano played his first game for Real Madrid, a friendly against Nancy of France. Real lost 4-2. Long-term, though, they were the big winners. Alfredo Di Stefano died on July 7, 2014 at the age of 88. A couple of years later, the European Cup was launched. We know it now as the Champions League, the foremost competition in the world, where reputations are made and where, according to the players, the standard of the game is highest. It is an unqualified success. But that was not an inevitable outcome. Back in 1955, when the thing got under way, it was a high-risk endeavour. It was only a decade since Europe had been at war. The process of reconstruction was not yet complete. England, for example, still had not completely eliminated rationing. Feelings of enmity and mistrust abounded. The English FA did not allow Chelsea to compete in the inaugural version. By 1960, when Real won their fifth consecutive European Cup with a famous 7-3 thrashing of Eintracht Frankfurt, it was a different story. The competition was already intrinsically linked with glamour and excitement -- much of that was down to Real, and in turn, much of that was down to Di Stefano. He was the conductor of the orchestra, the hub of everything the team sought to do. Bobby Charlton, then a young Manchester United reserve, will never forget the experience of watching Di Stefano from the stands in the 1957 semi-finals. "I thought 'Who is this man?' as he made his early impact on the game. 'He takes the ball from the goalkeeper; he tells the full-backs what to do; wherever he is on the field he is in a position to take the ball; you can see his influence on everything that is happening.' It was pure revelation. Everything seemed to radiate from him. I had never seen such a complete footballer. It was as though he had set up his own command centre at the heart of the game. He was as strong as he was subtle. The combination of qualities was mesmerising." Alfredo di Stefano (July 4, 1926 - July 7, 2014) • 308 goals in 11 seasons for Real Madrid. • Two-time Ballon d'Or winner (1957, 1959). • Eight La Liga titles, five European Cups with Madrid. • Scored 50 goals in 60 European Cup matches. • 31 international caps for Spain, scoring 23 goals. • Argentina born, he also played six times for the Albiceleste.  • Also played for River Plate, Millionarios (COL). Espanyol (ESP). • Coached eight teams, including Real Madrid and Valencia. • Real Madrid Castilla play at Alfredo di Stefano Stadium.   All around the continent football fans were going through the same epiphany. Everyone wanted to see Real Madrid. Everyone wanted to be Real Madrid. One of the first changes Don Revie made when he took over as manager of Leeds United was to change the club colours to all white, in honour of Di Stefano and his supporting cast. The quality of the spectacle they provided helped cement the European Cup as the pinnacle of the continent's club game -- it even jolted South America into starting an equivalent, the Copa Libertadores, so that its champion could go toe-to-toe with Europe's. The first winners of the new World Club trophy? Di Stefano's Real Madrid. Europe was changed forever. Some would even argue that the style and success of Real improved the image of Spain on the world stage -- the country was ruled at the time by the fascist dictator Francisco Franco -- and hastened the process by which the country became a mass tourist destination and went on to be reintegrated as a democracy into Western Europe. Others might say that this would be taking things too far. But the mere existence of the debate is testimony to the footballing genius of Alfredo Di Stefano, and his remarkable journey. After making his mark in his native Argentina and in Colombia, it was 60 years ago that he kicked off the most celebrated phase of a magnificent career.

Louis van Gaal a drastic change from David Moyes - ESPN FC	As the World Cup comes to its conclusion, next season's Premier League kickoff is just over five weeks away. Those who will find themselves covering Manchester United have a glint in their eye. This Louis van Gaal chap seems like he might provide some good stories win, draw or lose -- though especially lose. The Dutch master has carried himself as if he were the coach of the tournament. His public pronouncements are never slow in awarding himself credit. He has revealed himself to be no respecter of reputations, with the successful removals of Robin van Persie and Jasper Cillessen bringing in match winners for both the Netherlands' knockout matches. The Tim Krul introduction for the penalty shootout did a fine job of shrouding what had been a poor display against Costa Rica. The general who makes his own luck is a fine characteristic to call on in top-level coaching. At such a time, it is difficult not to draw comparisons with David Moyes, Van Gaal's hapless predecessor-to-be or "Poor David," as he became known to many in United circles. Van Gaal, brusque, self-assured and flamboyant, has looked in Brazil like everything Moyes could not be at Old Trafford. Moyes remains well-liked in football, except among those who helped bring about his fall in April. Plenty of goodwill is retained for him. He won much credit among the English press pack when showing up in Miami as the England squad prepared for its embarrassingly premature exit. Away from the glare of the postmatch flash interview or those uncomfortable news conferences that got shorter with each defeat, Moyes is a sociable, clubbable cove and won back the appreciation of those who became his tormentors during that disastrous nine months in charge. Louis van Gaal might not be the friendliest coach, but his management skills are top notch. One thing remains clear: Moyes was never a fit for United. On arrival, the place shrank him, one of British football's finest managers, and he never allowed himself to grow back. Van Gaal does not strike as a man to be so bowed, so humble. If the aim of the Glazer family's appointment is to reduce the residual influence of Sir Alex Ferguson, then such a dominant figure is necessary. Van Gaal has never been known to duck a challenge. Making returns to Barcelona, Ajax and the Dutch team suggests either reckless abandon or total self-assurance. Things did not work out at either club, but a return to the national team has provided vindication. Failing to get a generation containing Ruud van Nistelrooy, Patrick Kluivert, Clarence Seedorf and Edwin van der Sar to the 2002 World Cup was the biggest blot on his résumé, yet with a group of lesser talents, he has gone far beyond expectations in 2014. Like Moyes, Van Gaal is a tracksuit manager, but the evidence suggests that the results of their training ground work are very different. Moyes preached solidity, shape and linear football to players who refused to be converted. Van Gaal's Netherlands have played several different formations in five matches in Brazil, with adaptability, a tenet of "Total Football," at the heart of his dictations. Getting Ready For Argentina vs. Netherlands: - McIntyre: Argentina's defense rising to occasion - Delaney: Old foes reunite in Argentina vs. Netherlands - McIntyre: Superstars collide in Messi vs. Robben - Cox: Four teams, four key battles - Marcotti: Previewing the World Cup semifinals - World Cup Power Rankings: Germany on top - Ames: Gamesmanship alive and well The Netherlands' opening win against Spain will probably end up being the most devastating display of this entire World Cup. It was achieved through Van Gaal striking at the heart of Spain. Where others had previously sat back to be eventually lulled by Spain's possession game, the Dutch asked questions that the ailing holders could no longer answer. Van Persie and Arjen Robben in particular, players beyond their supposed peak years, performed as if given fresh footballing lives. Around them, their teammates always stuck to their coach's rigorous instructions; those United players whose interest dipped under Moyes will not get away with it now. "He is the brain behind everything," said Krul on Monday. "We know before each game what we have to do." In choosing to take on United after a World Cup, Van Gaal, hardly getting any younger at 62, placed great pressure on himself. Had the Dutch exited Group B, as many expected, then he faced arriving in Manchester as a lame duck. Now, no matter what might happen from this point on, he will arrive with his swagger fully justified, his blow-dried head held high. "I'm asking you, if you have such a clever question, if you're going to ask me questions, I'm going to ask you questions" is a sample of his World Cup news conferences. He has not joined Manchester United to make friends. Those expectant journalists are in for a far tougher ride from Van Gaal than they ever gave Moyes.	sports
Real Madrid legend Alfredo Di Stefano dies aged 88 - ESPN FC	Real Madrid legend Alfredo Di Stefano has died in hospital at the age of 88. - Alvarez: Di Stefano obituary - Vickery: Di Stefano, South America's greatest Di Stefano had been in a coma at the Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon in Madrid after he suffered a heart attack during a meal to celebrate his 88th birthday at the weekend. The former Argentina and Spain international was one of the greatest players of the 20th century, and an outstanding personality in the history of one of the world's biggest clubs. Real Madrid have praised Alfredo Di Stefano as 'the best player of all time.' News of Di Stefano's passing was confirmed via a statement released by Madrid on Monday afternoon. "Real Madrid CF announces that its honorary president, Alfredo Di Stefano, has died today at 5.15 p.m. at the Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon in Madrid," the statement read. "The president of Real Madrid, Florentino Perez, and the club's board wish to express their most profound condolences and all their affection to his children, his family and his friends. Real Madrid extends its condolences to madridistas all over the world and to those who feel the loss of the best player of all time." Alfredo di Stefano (July 4, 1926 - July 7, 2014) • 308 goals in 11 seasons for Real Madrid. • Two-time Ballon d'Or winner (1957, 1959). • Eight La Liga titles, five European Cups with Madrid. • Scored 50 goals in 60 European Cup matches. • 31 international caps for Spain, scoring 23 goals. • Argentina born, he also played six times for the Albiceleste.  • Also played for River Plate, Millionarios (COL). Espanyol (ESP). • Coached eight teams, including Real Madrid and Valencia. • Real Madrid Castilla play at Alfredo di Stefano Stadium. After joining Madrid in a controversial transfer in 1955, Di Stefano had led Los Blancos to eight of the next 10 La Liga titles, and most famously five successive European Cup trophies from 1956 to 1960. He was named Ballon d'Or winner in 1957 and 1959. During 11 seasons at Madrid, Di Stefano scored 308 goals in 396 games. He then played for two seasons at Espanyol, before coaching Elche, Boca Juniors, Valencia, Madrid, Sporting Lisbon, Rayo Vallecano, Castellon and River Plate. Since 2000, he has been honorary president back at Madrid, and a regular presence at games and club events. The Spanish FA, Argentine FA, Barcelona and many other clubs also issued statements of condolence. Madrid said on their official website that FIFA president Sepp Blatter and UEFA president Michel Platini had contacted Perez over the weekend to pass on their support and concern after Di Stefano fell into a coma. Spain coach Vicente del Bosque also quickly offered his condolences to Di Stefano's family and friends, in comments published on the Spanish FA website. "I had him as a coach in my last stage as a player, I knew him well so of course I am so sorry for the loss," the former Real Madrid boss said. "Of course I send my best wishes to his family and his circle and also to all madridismo, for whom it is such a sad day." Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo tweeted: "Don Alfredo leaves us, but his memory will last forever in our hearts. Legends never die. Thanks for everything Maestro. #EternoAlfredo". It's a very sad day. For me, for all the madridistas, for the world of football. #EternoAlfredo pic.twitter.com/VKRbSmO61s - Cristiano Ronaldo (@Cristiano) July 7, 2014	sports

Di Stefano's lasting legacy in Madrid - ESPN FC	Real Madrid have no shortage of star names in their well-decorated history book, but in Alfredo Di Stefano, who died on Monday after suffering a heart attack, they enjoyed the services of one of the best footballers of all time. "Thank you, Alfredo Di Stefano," said Los Merengues' official website following the announcement of his death at the age of 88. "The best player of all time passes away." Players such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane, Luis Figo, Ronaldo and Raul are among the talent-packed players who have donned the club's famous all-white colours but Argentina-born Di Stefano, who was the club's honorary president, topped the lot. He didn't just shine in his 11 trophy-packed years in the Spanish capital, he helped shape the future of arguably the most famous football club in the world. Here are five reasons the Blond Arrow, as he was affectionately known, was the most important player in the club's history. Success breeds success His individual talent ranked alongside the best players that have ever played the beautiful game. Scoring 308 goals in 396 competitive games for Madrid, Di Stefano set the benchmark for those stars who were to follow in his footsteps. He became the first Real Madrid player to win the Ballon d'Or when he won football's greatest individual prize in 1957 and he added another two years later. To bag the award once is an honour, to do it twice takes a special talent, and the Argentine was certainly that. His artistry rubbed off on the rest of his teammates and he hauled in a huge amount of trophies. Five consecutive European Cups, eight La Liga titles, one Spanish Cup and one Intercontinental Cup were among the vast array of club honours he bagged while with Los Blancos. Alfredo Di Stefano in his third season with Real Madrid. He played, shone and led Madrid's finest period in the club's history and set a winning mentality that continues to this day. Madrid were the leading light during the Blond Arrow's days, something they strive for now more than ever. Di Stefano set that winning mentality firmly in motion. His success has helped breed the success his club enjoy to this day. The start of Madrid's European obsession The European Cup has been an obsession for Madrid and Di Stefano played a key role in ensuring the trophy has become the most sought-after for Los Blancos. The Argentine scored the first goal as Madrid lifted the trophy for the first time in 1956 and it was a crucial strike. His team were 2-0 down against Stade de Reims inside 10 minutes before he scored the goal that got Madrid back into the game and eventually helped them to a thrilling 4-3 success in Paris. Di Stefano scored in each of Madrid's five European Cup final triumphs between 1956 and 1960. The five-star victories ensured Madrid were the team to beat in European competition and that continues to this day. It was therefore fitting that he was able to witness Los Merengues secure their long-awaited La Decima in Lisbon in May. The start of the Galacticos Di Stefano is often recognised as Madrid's first Galactico and can be credited with current president Florentino Perez's obsession with bringing in the best players on the planet. The Argentine was one of the first off-the-pitch stars, as well as shining on the pitch, with a number of appearances on the silver screen as well as being the star attraction during Madrid's golden era. He was big business for the club outside of football, a trend that continues more than ever today. - Carter: Revisiting Di Stefano's move to Madrid - Vickery: Di Stefano South America's greatest His talents caught the attention of Perez, then only a supporter during the Argentine's playing days, and Madrid's president brought his former idol on board at the Bernabeu in the capacity as honorary president during his first term in charge in 2000. That star attraction rubbed off on Perez, who has ensured he brings in a Galactico most of the seasons he's been in charge at the Bernabeu. Zidane, Figo, Ronaldo and David Beckham have led the way. Stars for the club not only on the pitch, but off it, too. Perez and Di Stefano have always been at the side of the new additions when unveiled to the press. El Clasico personified The Blond Arrow has left a huge footprint on Real Madrid but it could so easily have been in Catalonia as Spain's old foes battled it out for his signature. He first caught the attention of Madrid, and then-president Santiago Bernabeu, during a friendly in Madrid when playing for his Colombian club Millonarios, shining in a 4-2 victory for the visitors. It prompted Bernabeu to approach the club for his services to bring him to the Spanish capital, but the deal was not to prove straightforward. Barcelona were also interested and made an approach to the Colombians, as well as his parent club River Plate in Argentina. River accepted the deal but Millonarios did not due to Barca's approach to the deal. Eventually, however, Di Stefano was seemingly heading to Barcelona in 1953 but the Spanish federation refused to ratify the deal because both River and Millonarios could not agree on the deal. FIFA left the decision to the Spanish federation and they set up a deal that would allow the player to play for four seasons in the country -- two with Barca and two with Madrid. Eventually, Di Stefano would manage Madrid on two separate occasions. It was a deal that did not suit Barca and the player ended up in Madrid. It could so easily have been different and it could so easily have been the Blaugrana celebrating his success, and not Los Blancos. Post-playing-day presence Unsurprisingly, Madrid ensured Di Stefano continued to play a key role at Madrid when he retired as a player, although it was not imminent as then-president Bernabeu allowed his departure to Barcelona, albeit Espanyol. Believing the forward's time at the top was over, Bernabeu infuriated many Madrid fans by letting their star man leave the club, but he was sure to return. He came back as manager and played a key role in the emergence of the famous La Quinta del Buitre, led by Emilio Butragueno. His first stint came from 1982 to 1984 and he returned for a second short spell in 1990, his final season in the dugout. Although he won't be remembered for his management spells, the Argentine continued to be involved with the club, and in 2000 was named honorary president by Perez, lifting the Best Club of the 20th Century Trophy, awarded by FIFA. Valdebebas, Madrid's top-of-the-range training facility, also has its main stadium named after him with a statue outside. Madrid's second team, Real Madrid Castilla, play their home matches there, where he will continue to be remembered among Madrid fans and players young and old.	sports
Superstars collide in Messi vs. Robben - ESPN FC	SAO PAULO -- The eyes of 200 million Brazilians will be turned to the short-handed hosts' do-or-die match against Germany on Tuesday in Belo Horizonte. But it's this World Cup's other marquee semifinal -- between Argentina and the Netherlands -- that will showcase the top two remaining players in the tournament in Lionel Messi and Arjen Robben. That might not have been the case even if Selecao icon Neymar hadn't been forced to withdraw from the competition with a broken back. His injury, which has sent the already-fatalistic outlook of the locals toward even greater depths, came in Friday's win against a Colombia squad led by James Rodriguez, whose six goals lead the competition. Now, it's all about the two leading men in Wednesday's match when it comes to individual supremacy. That opportunity will be in front of them when they face off at Arena Corinthians. The Dutch and Albiceleste are mediocre teams led by exceptional singular talents. Usually, those squads get found out early. Not here, though. Part of the reason Brazil 2014 has been the most entertaining Cup in recent memory is that no team has truly distinguished itself. That means one brilliant individual performance could make the difference. It means there's a good chance that whoever performs better, Robben or Messi, could determine which side advances to Sunday's grand finale in Rio. Most of the attention will be on Messi, of course. The two biggest stars remaining in the World Cup -- Argentina's Lionel Messi and the Netherlands' Arjen Robben -- face off Wednesday. What's at stake for the tiny genius isn't lost on anyone. A World Cup win -- on Brazilian soil, no less -- would be the Albicleleste's first in 28 years, when Argentine deity Diego Maradona carried another decidedly average squad, quite literally single-handedly, to the title. Messi and Maradona are compared everywhere but in their shared homeland, which Messi left as a child and for which he has never been able to duplicate his exploits for club side Barcelona. Victory here may be the best chance he'll ever have of changing that, and it would also cement his legacy as one of the sport's true greats. But first, he'll have to get through the Oranje. And in what's guaranteed to be a tight game -- both teams have prioritized defense in the knockout rounds -- it could come down to one special moment. Odds are against this match being a classic, unlike their epic quarterfinal meeting in 1998. "Argentina was just stopping and slamming on the brakes," was Netherlands coach Louis van Gaal's assessment of the Albiceleste's 1-0 quarterfinal victory over Belgium. Getting Ready For Argentina vs. Netherlands: - McIntyre: Argentina's defense rising to occasion - Delaney: Old foes reunite in Argentina vs. Netherlands - McIntyre: Superstars collide in Messi vs. Robben - Cox: Four teams, four key battles - Marcotti: Previewing the World Cup semifinals - World Cup Power Rankings: Germany on top - Ames: Gamesmanship alive and well Meantime, the Dutch have found it difficult to score, managing just one goal from the run of play in two elimination games. Robben, though, was their best player in both. The Bayern Munich star's embellishment -- and the furor surrounding it -- has overshadowed that somewhat. Costa Rica's only answer for him on Saturday was to hack him down every time he got loose on the right wing. He tired to sell those fouls, sure, but fouls they were. With the ball at his feet, Robben has been the most dangerous player in the tournament so far, and he's finished three chances himself -- just one fewer than Messi. His leadership has also been crucial for the Dutch. "If players say something, that hits home much more than if I do," van Gaal said when asked about Robben's spirited address to his teammates before extra time commenced against the Ticos. Van Gaal praised the camaraderie of this team, a lack of which has famously torpedoed previous Dutch squads. There is a sense that this group is mentally tougher than its predecessors; Saturday's match marked the first time they'd won an extra-time match on the global stage in five tries. That bodes well for them on Wednesday. So does the improving form of playmaker Wesley Sneijder and the expected absence of injured Argentine midfielder Angel Di Maria. Still, not much separates these squads, and Argentina remains the slight odds (3-2) favorite. In the end, expect Robben or Messi to decide the outcome.

Louis van Gaal a drastic change from David Moyes - ESPN FC	As the World Cup comes to its conclusion, next season's Premier League kickoff is just over five weeks away. Those who will find themselves covering Manchester United have a glint in their eye. This Louis van Gaal chap seems like he might provide some good stories win, draw or lose -- though especially lose. The Dutch master has carried himself as if he were the coach of the tournament. His public pronouncements are never slow in awarding himself credit. He has revealed himself to be no respecter of reputations, with the successful removals of Robin van Persie and Jasper Cillessen bringing in match winners for both the Netherlands' knockout matches. The Tim Krul introduction for the penalty shootout did a fine job of shrouding what had been a poor display against Costa Rica. The general who makes his own luck is a fine characteristic to call on in top-level coaching. At such a time, it is difficult not to draw comparisons with David Moyes, Van Gaal's hapless predecessor-to-be or "Poor David," as he became known to many in United circles. Van Gaal, brusque, self-assured and flamboyant, has looked in Brazil like everything Moyes could not be at Old Trafford. Moyes remains well-liked in football, except among those who helped bring about his fall in April. Plenty of goodwill is retained for him. He won much credit among the English press pack when showing up in Miami as the England squad prepared for its embarrassingly premature exit. Away from the glare of the postmatch flash interview or those uncomfortable news conferences that got shorter with each defeat, Moyes is a sociable, clubbable cove and won back the appreciation of those who became his tormentors during that disastrous nine months in charge. Louis van Gaal might not be the friendliest coach, but his management skills are top notch. One thing remains clear: Moyes was never a fit for United. On arrival, the place shrank him, one of British football's finest managers, and he never allowed himself to grow back. Van Gaal does not strike as a man to be so bowed, so humble. If the aim of the Glazer family's appointment is to reduce the residual influence of Sir Alex Ferguson, then such a dominant figure is necessary. Van Gaal has never been known to duck a challenge. Making returns to Barcelona, Ajax and the Dutch team suggests either reckless abandon or total self-assurance. Things did not work out at either club, but a return to the national team has provided vindication. Failing to get a generation containing Ruud van Nistelrooy, Patrick Kluivert, Clarence Seedorf and Edwin van der Sar to the 2002 World Cup was the biggest blot on his résumé, yet with a group of lesser talents, he has gone far beyond expectations in 2014. Like Moyes, Van Gaal is a tracksuit manager, but the evidence suggests that the results of their training ground work are very different. Moyes preached solidity, shape and linear football to players who refused to be converted. Van Gaal's Netherlands have played several different formations in five matches in Brazil, with adaptability, a tenet of "Total Football," at the heart of his dictations. Getting Ready For Argentina vs. Netherlands: - McIntyre: Argentina's defense rising to occasion - Delaney: Old foes reunite in Argentina vs. Netherlands - McIntyre: Superstars collide in Messi vs. Robben - Cox: Four teams, four key battles - Marcotti: Previewing the World Cup semifinals - World Cup Power Rankings: Germany on top - Ames: Gamesmanship alive and well The Netherlands' opening win against Spain will probably end up being the most devastating display of this entire World Cup. It was achieved through Van Gaal striking at the heart of Spain. Where others had previously sat back to be eventually lulled by Spain's possession game, the Dutch asked questions that the ailing holders could no longer answer. Van Persie and Arjen Robben in particular, players beyond their supposed peak years, performed as if given fresh footballing lives. Around them, their teammates always stuck to their coach's rigorous instructions; those United players whose interest dipped under Moyes will not get away with it now. "He is the brain behind everything," said Krul on Monday. "We know before each game what we have to do." In choosing to take on United after a World Cup, Van Gaal, hardly getting any younger at 62, placed great pressure on himself. Had the Dutch exited Group B, as many expected, then he faced arriving in Manchester as a lame duck. Now, no matter what might happen from this point on, he will arrive with his swagger fully justified, his blow-dried head held high. "I'm asking you, if you have such a clever question, if you're going to ask me questions, I'm going to ask you questions" is a sample of his World Cup news conferences. He has not joined Manchester United to make friends. Those expectant journalists are in for a far tougher ride from Van Gaal than they ever gave Moyes.	sports

Alfredo Di Stefano - a tribute - ESPN FC	Alfredo Di Stefano had the power to change a generation of young players. When I was a child, my mother used to take my sister and I to her parents' house every Thursday afternoon. My grandfather Joaquín, a lifelong Madridista and socio since time immemorial was a man of few words and borderline grumpy, but his face lit up when asked about his favourite topic: football. Mostly Real Madrid's golden age in the late 1950s, when the Merengues dominated the European Cup and Alfredo Di Stefano earned his legendary status in world football. Those like Joaquín, lucky enough to have watched Di Stefano play, never fail to touch upon two things: The first was his amazing talent around the ball. "He created new dribble, ways to strike the ball, and performed tricks I've never seen again, like the goal he scored with his backheel, jumping while facing the goal," he once told me. Carried away by his memories, my grandfather then tried to imitate the move -- something vaguely similar to Rene Higuita's signature scorpion kick -- pretending to hit the ball only with one leg. It was by no means the sort of exercise a 70-something-year-old should try, but Joaquín would go any length to impress his grandson and instil the Di Stefano creed in him. The second and probably most remarkable characteristic repeated by Di Stefano's legion of admirers refers to his ability to impact a match in endless ways, one tireless display after another. Despite wearing a very traditional number No. 9 shirt, he refused to occupy one specific position and preferred to roam around the pitch, choosing the areas where he could hurt most the opposition. "He took football from still photos to motion pictures," former Real Madrid player and fellow Argentinean Jorge Valdano once said. Alfredo di Stefano (July 4, 1926 - July 7, 2014) • 308 goals in 11 seasons for Real Madrid. • Two-time Ballon d'Or winner (1957, 1959). • Eight La Liga titles, five European Cups with Madrid. • Scored 50 goals in 60 European Cup matches. • 31 international caps for Spain, scoring 23 goals. • Argentina born, he also played six times for the Albiceleste.  • Also played for River Plate, Millionarios (COL). Espanyol (ESP). • Coached eight teams, including Real Madrid and Valencia. • Real Madrid Castilla play at Alfredo di Stefano Stadium. Don Joaquín mentioned Di Stefano's 'Total Football' approach [long before it had been coined as a term] often enough. My grandfather could spend hours talking about how la Saeta Rubia (the Blond Arrow) appeared omnipresent in the match and carried the side on his shoulders from the moment the ref first blew the whistle; he did so by taking control of the whole stadium as well as by imposing a work ethic that defined the profile of the type of player the Bernabeu still favours 60 years later: the one that, alongside their considerable talent, makes a point of showing effort and commitment in every play. Di Stefano's winning obsession took him to recommend players to be hired by President Bernabeu -- "I know a good player as soon as he steps on the pitch," the Blond Arrow stated in his autobiography "Gracias, vieja" (Thanks, old woman; in reference to the football). Indeed, he preferred to play with his own people as he was often accused of exerting a quite demanding type of leadership in the dressing room. "He was as nasty as they come with his teammates, because of his competitiveness," my grandfather used to say. "I remember a sequence of five matches at the Bernabeu during which he managed to yell at every single member of the team every match. All of them! A friend and I were keeping count. And the squad ended up winning every single one of those matches by a three-goal difference!" Joaquín's -- and most Madridistas' -- only regret regarding the Blond Arrow involved the national team. An Argentinean national during the World Cups of 1950 and 1954, he could not play in those two as his country of origin declined to participate. After he became a Spanish national in 1956, Spain failed to qualify for 1958, and then Di Stefano picked up an injury right before the 1962 World Cup (he made the trip to Chile, but did not play). "A shame, a complete shame. Terrible luck. Thank God I'll always have Hampden Park to remember": Joaquín remembered the epic 1960 European Cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt in Scotland almost every Thursday. Many believe that to be the best match ever played, and Di Stefano's complete domination of proceedings and his incredible hat trick, together with the final 7-3 scoreline, put him on the pantheon of greatest players ever. Di Stefano scores in the 1960 final against Eintracht Frankfurt. When he left to play for Espanyol in 1964, Joaquín could not forgive Santiago Bernabeu, saying: "We Madridistas don't know how to bid farewell to our idols." When Di Stefano moved into coaching, my grandfather followed his career closely, but a hint of disappointment when speaking about those years always showed: "He was never a Di Stefano of the bench, neither he enjoyed having players of his level at any of the clubs he coached". Sadly, when current Real Madrid president Florentino Perez declared Di Stéfano President of Honour in 2000, my grandfather had passed away a few years earlier. He never had the chance of seeing his idol occupy the place he deserved in the club's hierarchy. That said, I couldn't help an emotional moment six months ago, while reading Di Stefano's autobiography. At some point, remembering his favourite goals, Alfredo didn't hesitate: "The best? In my second season with Real Madrid I remember one I scored hitting the ball with my back heel, while I was in the air facing the goal." As I was reading these words I could picture my grandfather 30 years ago jumping on one foot to make his almost incomprehensible impression of the best goal he ever saw, the best one the Blond Arrow himself ever scored. And only then I completely understood how much those Thursdays with Don Joaquin fed my interest in football, and how important a man I never saw play live was for this passion of mine. Now that he's gone, Di Stefano's feats will stay alive in the stories one generation tells the next; inspiring newcomers to learn to love the game in the same way that one of its idols did so much.	sports

Cesare Prandelli the star man at Galatasaray - ESPN FC	Galatasaray president Unal Aysal is perhaps Turkey's most high profile frequenter of the managerial merry-go-round. For the second time in a row, it has thrown up an Italian, and for the third, a former Fiorentina boss, as Cesare Prandelli fills Roberto Mancini's recently vacated seat. The original favourite had been Shakhtar's dynasty-builder Mircea Lucescu, with the Turkish rumour mill reporting his arrival in Istanbul at various times this summer. Curiously for Manchester United fans, the news then broke that Galatasaray were holding talks with David Moyes, as the obligatory pictures of the Scot arriving at Istanbul Ataturk airport surfaced. Yet Galatasaray's overlords have now settled on Cesare Prandelli, reacting swiftly to events at the 2014 World Cup after Italy's failure to reach the knockout stages and Prandelli's subsequent resignation. The mission for Prandelli, with "aim" not seeming a strong enough term, is simple. The 56-year-old must ensure that Galatasaray reach their 20th league title before cross-continental rivals Fenerbahce. Both clubs are currently star-gazing, with Turkish sides being awarded a star above their crest for every five league titles. They each have three stars and stand on 19 titles, which Fener drawing level after their triumphant 2013-14 campaign. Indeed, at the news conference for his unveiling Prandelli accepted the mission. "Our goal is very clear," he said. "To get the fourth star and to be successful in the Champions League." The narrative for the coming season is already set, both teams shooting for the star. Mancini, though, failed in the two most important tasks that any Galatasaray manager faces. The first being the raison d'etre of the club, the entire foundation on which its history and prestige has been built, winning the Turkish League. The 49-year-old also did little to adhere himself to the masses of Galatasaray fans throughout the country, always giving the impression that his tenure was a temporary one, a sort of filler before moving on to something new. Man City fans famously spent £7,000 to place a "thank you" message in La Gazzetta dello Sport after Mancini was sacked at Eastlands. It is unlikely he will get the same from Gala fans. Despite such shortcomings, Mancini's tenure was a qualified success. An encapsulating, snow-ridden 1-0 win over Juventus in Istanbul meant Mancini succeeded in taking Galatasaray to the knockout stages of the Champions League. That said, an eventual round-of-16 defeat to Chelsea, with the questionable use of a 4-2-4 formation in the home leg, raised eyebrows once again. The Italian also brought more silverware to the Turk Telekom Arena, as a Wesley Sneijder goal saw off Eskisehirspor in the Turkish Cup final. Yet without the league, other successes fade become irrelevant. Cesare Prandelli signs his contract alongside Galatasaray president Unal Aysal. Prandelli will have been briefed on these requirements during the negotiation stage. His first task will need to be an appeal to the fans, ensuring that the famous "Welcome to Hell" is directed at the opposition and not at the club's new manager. To do that an air of permanence must be cultivated, contrasting with the stop-gap nature of Mancini. "I met the president and I heard that he wants to achieve certain results and maybe this is what I need," said Prandelli as he accepted the lofty requirements of a Galatasaray boss. "I want to challenge, I think I have made the right decision because the aim is to win." On the field, Galatasaray need co-ordination to tighten a loose defence. Mancini went some way to creating a solid unit, but individual errors and lapses in concentration too often hampered the previous campaign. At the top of the pitch, with Drogba now gone, Burak Yilmaz will again become the main focal point in front of Wesley Sneijder, though a necessary reliance on Turkish-born players is enforced through the league's strict foreigner quotas. Semih Kaya, Selcuk Inan and the aforementioned Yilmaz are likely to form a permanent spine in Prandelli's Galatasaray. Learning Turkish will aid Prandelli's transition to this large and complex nation, and having never worked outside of Italy and the Italian language will prove another challenge. Mancini, strangely, conducted his news conferences in English, translated into Turkish. The input of the Italian's non-standard English left an output of non-standard Turkish, baffling a few journalists. Indeed, if a question was put to Mancini in English, the arduous process of announcing a translation of the question before the answer added to the tedium. Due to the perceived ease of communication, it is now customary that any manager working in a foreign land will be linked with players from his home nation. The Italian has been pestered about the possible signing of Mario Balotelli from Milan, but insisted that he "cannot talk about it," though he did refer to Juventus' Andrea Pirlo as the hallmark of a Prandelli player. "I love football players who want to win like Pirlo," he said.

Cesare Prandelli the star man at Galatasaray - ESPN FC	Galatasaray president Unal Aysal is perhaps Turkey's most high profile frequenter of the managerial merry-go-round. For the second time in a row, it has thrown up an Italian, and for the third, a former Fiorentina boss, as Cesare Prandelli fills Roberto Mancini's recently vacated seat. The original favourite had been Shakhtar's dynasty-builder Mircea Lucescu, with the Turkish rumour mill reporting his arrival in Istanbul at various times this summer. Curiously for Manchester United fans, the news then broke that Galatasaray were holding talks with David Moyes, as the obligatory pictures of the Scot arriving at Istanbul Ataturk airport surfaced. Yet Galatasaray's overlords have now settled on Cesare Prandelli, reacting swiftly to events at the 2014 World Cup after Italy's failure to reach the knockout stages and Prandelli's subsequent resignation. The mission for Prandelli, with "aim" not seeming a strong enough term, is simple. The 56-year-old must ensure that Galatasaray reach their 20th league title before cross-continental rivals Fenerbahce. Both clubs are currently star-gazing, with Turkish sides being awarded a star above their crest for every five league titles. They each have three stars and stand on 19 titles, which Fener drawing level after their triumphant 2013-14 campaign. Indeed, at the news conference for his unveiling Prandelli accepted the mission. "Our goal is very clear," he said. "To get the fourth star and to be successful in the Champions League." The narrative for the coming season is already set, both teams shooting for the star. Mancini, though, failed in the two most important tasks that any Galatasaray manager faces. The first being the raison d'etre of the club, the entire foundation on which its history and prestige has been built, winning the Turkish League. The 49-year-old also did little to adhere himself to the masses of Galatasaray fans throughout the country, always giving the impression that his tenure was a temporary one, a sort of filler before moving on to something new. Man City fans famously spent £7,000 to place a "thank you" message in La Gazzetta dello Sport after Mancini was sacked at Eastlands. It is unlikely he will get the same from Gala fans. Despite such shortcomings, Mancini's tenure was a qualified success. An encapsulating, snow-ridden 1-0 win over Juventus in Istanbul meant Mancini succeeded in taking Galatasaray to the knockout stages of the Champions League. That said, an eventual round-of-16 defeat to Chelsea, with the questionable use of a 4-2-4 formation in the home leg, raised eyebrows once again. The Italian also brought more silverware to the Turk Telekom Arena, as a Wesley Sneijder goal saw off Eskisehirspor in the Turkish Cup final. Yet without the league, other successes fade become irrelevant. Cesare Prandelli signs his contract alongside Galatasaray president Unal Aysal. Prandelli will have been briefed on these requirements during the negotiation stage. His first task will need to be an appeal to the fans, ensuring that the famous "Welcome to Hell" is directed at the opposition and not at the club's new manager. To do that an air of permanence must be cultivated, contrasting with the stop-gap nature of Mancini. "I met the president and I heard that he wants to achieve certain results and maybe this is what I need," said Prandelli as he accepted the lofty requirements of a Galatasaray boss. "I want to challenge, I think I have made the right decision because the aim is to win." On the field, Galatasaray need co-ordination to tighten a loose defence. Mancini went some way to creating a solid unit, but individual errors and lapses in concentration too often hampered the previous campaign. At the top of the pitch, with Drogba now gone, Burak Yilmaz will again become the main focal point in front of Wesley Sneijder, though a necessary reliance on Turkish-born players is enforced through the league's strict foreigner quotas. Semih Kaya, Selcuk Inan and the aforementioned Yilmaz are likely to form a permanent spine in Prandelli's Galatasaray. Learning Turkish will aid Prandelli's transition to this large and complex nation, and having never worked outside of Italy and the Italian language will prove another challenge. Mancini, strangely, conducted his news conferences in English, translated into Turkish. The input of the Italian's non-standard English left an output of non-standard Turkish, baffling a few journalists. Indeed, if a question was put to Mancini in English, the arduous process of announcing a translation of the question before the answer added to the tedium. Due to the perceived ease of communication, it is now customary that any manager working in a foreign land will be linked with players from his home nation. The Italian has been pestered about the possible signing of Mario Balotelli from Milan, but insisted that he "cannot talk about it," though he did refer to Juventus' Andrea Pirlo as the hallmark of a Prandelli player. "I love football players who want to win like Pirlo," he said. But Galatasaray President Unal Aysal has looked to quash any prospective rumours by briefing the Turkish media that only one or two major signings will be made this summer, leaving Prandelli with little scope to effect major change in the playing staff. Indeed, 12 permanent deals were concluded over the course of the 2013-14 season as the club failed to counter-act a resurgent Fenerbahce.

Rob Ferrel: World Cup hair artist extraordinaire - ESPN FC	San Antonio-based hair artist and master barber Rob Ferrel puts the finishing touches on yet another Lionel Messi hair portrait. Far from the beaches of Brazil, Rob Ferrel is a barber/stylist in San Antonio, Texas, who has shot to prominence during this World Cup for his remarkable artistry, namely his portraits of football's stars that are trimmed, shaved and painted on the heads of waiting customers. Originally from San Diego, Ferrel eventually made his way to San Antonio eight years ago. In October 2012 he opened up Rob The Original Barbershop, located in a small plaza south of the city's downtown. Over time, Ferrel started generating attention by doing portraits and designs in people's hair. The first? The late rapper Tupac Shakur, who was crafted on the head of Ferrel's brother. "I grew up in a big family and didn't have an allowance or anything like that so I was always cutting my own hair, cutting my brother's hair.  I was always drawing, too, when I was a kid. Art is my passion so I've just combined the two," Ferrel said by phone to ESPNFC.com. Since the World Cup started, the requests for music icons and San Antonio Spurs players have given way to those who practice the beautiful game: Javier "Chicharito" Hernandez, Guillermo Ochoa, Tim Howard, Neymar and Lionel Messi. And for the past several weeks his shop has been packed with people watching games while waiting to have their footballing heroes to be emblazoned on their heads. "When Mexico were still in it, we got lots of requests for them," said Ferrel -- a logical notion, with San Antonio being a city so heavily populated by Mexican-Americans. "But now that they are out, we are getting lots of requests for Neymar and Messi.  It's amazing, fans of these teams and players are everywhere." The end products are startling, and without question the most distinct aspect of the portraits is the use of color. It is a two-hour process that starts with Ferrel using an image of the player on his phone. He places it next to the customer and simply works off of the picture. Ferrel then takes his trimmer and a straight razor to lay the canvas for each individual portrait. Non-toxic eyeliner pencils and lip-liner pencils, which are safe on the skin, are used to generate the colors. As a final touch, hairspray is then applied to give the head an extra layer of protection. "It helps give the portrait an extra sheen, another coating.  It might smudge a little if you walk outside and it's raining, but not too bad," notes Ferrel. "If you wear a hoodie it'll be fine." While he has a team of 10 barbers at his shop -- all in their early 20s -- who handle haircuts and some different designs, the 28-year-old Ferrel is the only one who does portraits. "I put on my headphones to get in a zone and jam out to music while I do it. I'll check with the customer every once in a while, but otherwise I just get locked in and when I'm done I sometimes even impress myself with my work," he said. The business and attention he has received during the World Cup has been "incredible," and the uber-motivated Ferrel, who is planning a second location and has designs on franchising, hopes it is just the beginning. "All of us are serious about our work, we're professional and we do quality work. Hair portraits is a trend that is only growing," he said. Who knows, maybe by Russia 2018, hair portraits of people's favorite footballers will be available nationwide at the local Rob The Barbershop.	sports
The goalies who can steal the show - ESPN FC	For a World Cup that has already become defined by its open football, an awful lot of it has revolved around the men most responsible for shutting things down. It has been a goalkeeper's tournament, even if that is not how it will be remembered. So many memorable moments have centred on the No. 1s, however, and they have provided many of the most notable individual performances, too. It became apparent from the start, as Iker Casillas' errors ensured he personified Spain's remarkably quick decline and collapse. Joe Hart attracted attention for his displays of rage, Julio Cesar for shedding tears. Manuel Neuer has been all too willing to shed a goalkeeper's usual role by coming so far off his line, while Louis van Gaal went further than most managers by saving a substitution in extra time so he could put on Tim Krul for Jasper Cillessen ahead of the penalty shootout. Although that puts even more focus on the goalkeepers ahead of the semifinals, it was only the latest defining display. There were also those from Guillermo Ochoa, Vincent Enyeama, Tim Howard and Keylor Navas. It's certainly difficult to remember a World Cup with so many eye-catching performances from so many different goalkeepers. To a degree, that is partially because of the open football itself, since there is simply a greater need for the netminders to step up and often step out. Brazil vs. Germany: Tuesday, 4 ET, 9 BST (ESPN and WatchESPN) - Marcotti: Titans collide in the semifinals - Honigstein: Bierhoff's technological focus - Torre: Scolari lightens the mood - Brewin: Battered Brazil vs. vulnerable Germany - Smith: Jogo bonito the exception, not the rule - 50-50 Challenge: Brazil vs. Germany - Duarte: Brazil move past star absences - Cox: Brazil and Germany's role reversal It is also exceptionally relevant, and potentially decisive, ahead of the most exacting stage. One of the other themes of this World Cup has been the fact there is no truly great team, that they all have flaws. Most of those flaws tend to be in defence. Brazil have been sloppy, Germany conspicuously porous, Argentina a little imbalanced and the Dutch susceptible to being opened by better sides. As such, one of the goalkeepers could yet be called upon to create history ... Julio Cesar Age: 34 Club: Queens Park Rangers It was Cesar's tears that provoked so much discussion about the psychology of this Brazilian team as well as the pressure on them, but also his displays that played a large part in ensuring they have progressed to this point. Cesar offset Ochoa in that 0-0 tie with Mexico with some fine saves of his own, made one crucial stop against Chile when the score was 1-1 and then stopped two penalties in the decisive shootout. His performances have been all the more pointed because of what has happened to Cesar in the past few years, since the last World Cup. He has remained under scrutiny because of the error that saw Brazil knocked out by the Netherlands in the quarterfinals in South Africa, but his career has not quite stayed at the same level. A move to QPR saw him eventually getting dropped in all the controversy around the club's raft of expensive signings, and he has spent the past season on loan at Toronto FC. Julio Cesar's emotions came to the fore after Brazil's shootout win over Chile in the round of 16. Surprise has been expressed in Brazil that a team hoping to win a World Cup would play a goalkeeper not currently operating at the absolute top level of the game, but manager Felipe Scolari has stuck by Cesar. It has so far paid off. Whatever their collective psychology, Brazil have been able to feel a little more secure with Cesar on such form. Manuel Neuer Age: 28 Club: Bayern Munich Currently in the prime of his career, and probably the best goalkeeper in the world right now, Neuer also possesses a disproportionately influential role in a team that have long suggested they themselves are ready to become the best in the world. His forays off his line may have generated much discussion, but it is his comfort with aspects of outfield play that allows Germany to set themselves up so assuredly high up the pitch, and his impressively long kicking that offers a genuine attacking outlet. Germany team manager Oliver Bierhoff has spoken of how Neuer likes to get ball boys to play him quick one-twos if the ball has not been near his box for a while in order to remain sharp. Neuer is one of those goalkeepers that, like Petr Cech prior to his head injury, is an impressively safe pair of hands. Any errors are only so conspicuous because they are so rare. Neuer simply radiates security, which is imperative in a team that is otherwise so radically open. His record of conceding only three goals in five games is impressive because Germany have otherwise coughed up so many chances. With Neuer, that porousness is not as decisive as it might otherwise be. Sergio Romero Age: 27 Club: Sampdoria As resilient as Argentina have been in fighting their way through each round of this tournament, their games have repeatedly had at least one moment of panic. That has usually involved an opposition forward surging through, all of a sudden exposing their imbalance, and Argentina being left in a hugely promising position. So far, for the most part, the opposition has not been able to take advantage. That is because of the form of Sergio Romero, who has made a number of big stops throughout this World Cup, especially with his feet. Netherlands vs. Argentina: July 9, 4 ET (ESPN and WatchESPN) - Stats: Diego Maradona vs. Lionel Messi - McIntyre: Superstars collide in Messi vs. Robben - Brewin: Van Gaal's management style - Brassell: Semifinalists have much to lose - Honigstein: Kuyt an unsung hero for the Dutch - Cox: Key semifinal matchups - Marcotti: Then there were four at the World Cup - Five Aside: Dutch, Argentina look to overcome past Such sharpness has been impressive, because the 27-year-old has suffered similar issues to Cesar. He spent the 2013-14 season on loan at Monaco from Sampdoria, but barely played. It added to an ongoing debate about who, exactly, Alejandro Sabella's goalkeeper would be. The manager eventually made his decision in March, and Romero has been more than stable since. He has the best saves-to-shots ratio in the tournament. It would also be surprising if this World Cup didn't allow him to save his club career. Jasper Cillessen Age: 25 Club: Ajax It says a lot about how Louis van Gaal has set up his Dutch team that, unless there are real dramatics in the last few games, Jasper Cillessen's World Cup will mostly be remembered for being replaced by Tim Krul for that decisive penalty shootout against Costa Rica. There was also his furious reaction, for which the Ajax goalkeeper subsequently apologised. In that, Cillessen does stand out from the rest of the goalkeepers left, mainly because Van Gaal's tactics have ensured he isn't exposed quite as much. The irony is that he has conceded one more than both Romero and Neuer, but that is not his fault. It also illustrates that Cillessen is almost the perfect goalkeeper for the system. He follows a Dutch tradition of being technically comfortable off his line, but has still proven himself a fine shot-stopper. As Krul was all too willing to point out, it was a brilliant Cillessen save that ensured the Netherlands actually made it to the shootout against Costa Rica in the first place.

Mangan: Debuchy a suitable replacement for Sagna - ESPN FC	France international Mathieu Debuchy has been strongly linked with a move to Arsenal. Bacary Sagna was a popular figure at Arsenal throughout his seven year tenure, and after moving to Manchester City on a free transfer, there's a fear that manager Arsene Wenger will struggle to replace his quality and reliability. It appears that Newcastle United's Mathieu Debuchy is the man chosen to do the job, and a quick comparison of the two players shows similarities in terms of what they produce. Looking at last season's Premier League, we can draw some comparisons. For the record, Sagna played 35 games, Debuchy 29. - Report: Arsenal 'close in on Sanchez, Debuchy' - Report: Liverpool give up hope of signing Sanchez - Report: Debuchy confirms Arsenal talks Their defensive contributions see the Newcastle man come out on top. Debuchy has made 71 tackles to Sagna's 45, has 69 interceptions to Sagna's 51 and wins out on blocks with 12 to seven. A good start. Offensively, they both scored one goal each, Sagna had two assists while Debuchy had three and the chance creation again saw the Newcastle defender come out on top with 23 to 21. So far, so good. However, a quick look at a key stat shows Debuchy's pass completion rate at just 73 percent, while Sagna's was 85 percent. Arsenal are a team that looks to dominate possession, and while perhaps it's illustrative of carelessness in Debuchy's distribution, there may be other factors. At Arsenal he's much more likely to find an outlet with players capable of clever movement, so it's a small concern but definitely something that can be improved. It's also worth noting that Sagna was clearly more cautious, playing 791 backward passes compared to Debuchy's 267. He may have been under instruction to get it forward, or didn't have a centre-half like Per Mertesacker, who was always available to Sagna if he had to turn back. One of Arsenal's tactics over the last couple of seasons -- especially as they've lacked height in midfield -- is to aim the goal kicks towards the right hand side for Sagna to win. His aerial ability at the back, and in open play, has been valuable for Wenger's team. So how do they match up there? Sagna comes out on top, but just barely, with 119 successful aerial duels won to Debuchy's 111. It suggests that the new man's arrival isn't going to create a big issue for Wenger tactically, in regards to figuring out how to replace Sagna's aerial prowess. General discipline is an area to look at, however. Debuchy picked up eight yellow cards and one red card, committing 41 fouls throughout the campaign. Sagna may have been booked a relatively similar number of times (six), but he committed just 23 fouls, so that's something Debuchy would have to work on. While we can compare and contrasts stats, we know that can only tell us so much. Add the opinion of somebody who watched Debuchy week in and week out for Newcastle, and we get a better picture of the player. Ed Harrison, of NUFCblog.com, is sad to see him go, saying, "He was one of [the] best players last season. He's only been at the club 18 months -- and since he gives 100% in every game and has a great temperament -- most of our fans will be sad to see him leave." He highlights a positive attitude going forward but says, "Mathieu goes forward so much that he sometimes gets caught upfield and out of position. When he started out on Tyneside he was also a bit reckless with some of his tackles inside the box and gave away a couple of penalties. "But he improved a lot in the 18 months he was at [the] club, and he's a much better player than when [the club] initially signed him." Overall, it looks like Arsenal are getting a player who, at 28, is very much in the prime of his career, and one whose performances appear to be on an upward curve. Having played in England since January 2013, there's no issue of acclimatisation or adaptation, and he should fit right in at the Emirates. There are clearly one or two things about his game that can be improved. But under the tutelage of Wenger, and with the defensive nous of Steve Bould on the training ground, there's no reason why Debuchy can't be a success for the Gunners. His arrival might be accompanied by that of Chilean forward Alexis Sanchez. Although there's nothing concrete just yet, there's a growing belief that he'll join from Barcelona, and what a signing he would be. If and when it happens, it's something that can be looked at in more detail, but he would pretty much be the perfect capture. He adds pace, strength and goals. He can play wide, off a main striker, or even as the front man and his versatility, as well as his quality, is obviously something that has attracted Wenger. Fingers crossed, but it looks like it could be an excellent start to Arsenal's summer business.	sports

It has so far paid off. Whatever their collective psychology, Brazil have been able to feel a little more secure with Cesar on such form. Manuel Neuer Age: 28 Club: Bayern Munich Currently in the prime of his career, and probably the best goalkeeper in the world right now, Neuer also possesses a disproportionately influential role in a team that have long suggested they themselves are ready to become the best in the world. His forays off his line may have generated much discussion, but it is his comfort with aspects of outfield play that allows Germany to set themselves up so assuredly high up the pitch, and his impressively long kicking that offers a genuine attacking outlet. Germany team manager Oliver Bierhoff has spoken of how Neuer likes to get ball boys to play him quick one-twos if the ball has not been near his box for a while in order to remain sharp. Neuer is one of those goalkeepers that, like Petr Cech prior to his head injury, is an impressively safe pair of hands. Any errors are only so conspicuous because they are so rare. Neuer simply radiates security, which is imperative in a team that is otherwise so radically open. His record of conceding only three goals in five games is impressive because Germany have otherwise coughed up so many chances. With Neuer, that porousness is not as decisive as it might otherwise be. Sergio Romero Age: 27 Club: Sampdoria As resilient as Argentina have been in fighting their way through each round of this tournament, their games have repeatedly had at least one moment of panic. That has usually involved an opposition forward surging through, all of a sudden exposing their imbalance, and Argentina being left in a hugely promising position. So far, for the most part, the opposition has not been able to take advantage. That is because of the form of Sergio Romero, who has made a number of big stops throughout this World Cup, especially with his feet. Netherlands vs. Argentina: July 9, 4 ET (ESPN and WatchESPN) - Stats: Diego Maradona vs. Lionel Messi - McIntyre: Superstars collide in Messi vs. Robben - Brewin: Van Gaal's management style - Brassell: Semifinalists have much to lose - Honigstein: Kuyt an unsung hero for the Dutch - Cox: Key semifinal matchups - Marcotti: Then there were four at the World Cup - Five Aside: Dutch, Argentina look to overcome past Such sharpness has been impressive, because the 27-year-old has suffered similar issues to Cesar. He spent the 2013-14 season on loan at Monaco from Sampdoria, but barely played. It added to an ongoing debate about who, exactly, Alejandro Sabella's goalkeeper would be. The manager eventually made his decision in March, and Romero has been more than stable since. He has the best saves-to-shots ratio in the tournament. It would also be surprising if this World Cup didn't allow him to save his club career. Jasper Cillessen Age: 25 Club: Ajax It says a lot about how Louis van Gaal has set up his Dutch team that, unless there are real dramatics in the last few games, Jasper Cillessen's World Cup will mostly be remembered for being replaced by Tim Krul for that decisive penalty shootout against Costa Rica. There was also his furious reaction, for which the Ajax goalkeeper subsequently apologised. In that, Cillessen does stand out from the rest of the goalkeepers left, mainly because Van Gaal's tactics have ensured he isn't exposed quite as much. The irony is that he has conceded one more than both Romero and Neuer, but that is not his fault. It also illustrates that Cillessen is almost the perfect goalkeeper for the system. He follows a Dutch tradition of being technically comfortable off his line, but has still proven himself a fine shot-stopper. As Krul was all too willing to point out, it was a brilliant Cillessen save that ensured the Netherlands actually made it to the shootout against Costa Rica in the first place.

The goalies who can steal the show - ESPN FC	For a World Cup that has already become defined by its open football, an awful lot of it has revolved around the men most responsible for shutting things down. It has been a goalkeeper's tournament, even if that is not how it will be remembered. So many memorable moments have centred on the No. 1s, however, and they have provided many of the most notable individual performances, too. It became apparent from the start, as Iker Casillas' errors ensured he personified Spain's remarkably quick decline and collapse. Joe Hart attracted attention for his displays of rage, Julio Cesar for shedding tears. Manuel Neuer has been all too willing to shed a goalkeeper's usual role by coming so far off his line, while Louis van Gaal went further than most managers by saving a substitution in extra time so he could put on Tim Krul for Jasper Cillessen ahead of the penalty shootout. Although that puts even more focus on the goalkeepers ahead of the semifinals, it was only the latest defining display. There were also those from Guillermo Ochoa, Vincent Enyeama, Tim Howard and Keylor Navas. It's certainly difficult to remember a World Cup with so many eye-catching performances from so many different goalkeepers. To a degree, that is partially because of the open football itself, since there is simply a greater need for the netminders to step up and often step out. Brazil vs. Germany: Tuesday, 4 ET, 9 BST (ESPN and WatchESPN) - Marcotti: Titans collide in the semifinals - Honigstein: Bierhoff's technological focus - Torre: Scolari lightens the mood - Brewin: Battered Brazil vs. vulnerable Germany - Smith: Jogo bonito the exception, not the rule - 50-50 Challenge: Brazil vs. Germany - Duarte: Brazil move past star absences - Cox: Brazil and Germany's role reversal It is also exceptionally relevant, and potentially decisive, ahead of the most exacting stage. One of the other themes of this World Cup has been the fact there is no truly great team, that they all have flaws. Most of those flaws tend to be in defence. Brazil have been sloppy, Germany conspicuously porous, Argentina a little imbalanced and the Dutch susceptible to being opened by better sides. As such, one of the goalkeepers could yet be called upon to create history ... Julio Cesar Age: 34 Club: Queens Park Rangers It was Cesar's tears that provoked so much discussion about the psychology of this Brazilian team as well as the pressure on them, but also his displays that played a large part in ensuring they have progressed to this point. Cesar offset Ochoa in that 0-0 tie with Mexico with some fine saves of his own, made one crucial stop against Chile when the score was 1-1 and then stopped two penalties in the decisive shootout. His performances have been all the more pointed because of what has happened to Cesar in the past few years, since the last World Cup. He has remained under scrutiny because of the error that saw Brazil knocked out by the Netherlands in the quarterfinals in South Africa, but his career has not quite stayed at the same level. A move to QPR saw him eventually getting dropped in all the controversy around the club's raft of expensive signings, and he has spent the past season on loan at Toronto FC. Julio Cesar's emotions came to the fore after Brazil's shootout win over Chile in the round of 16. Surprise has been expressed in Brazil that a team hoping to win a World Cup would play a goalkeeper not currently operating at the absolute top level of the game, but manager Felipe Scolari has stuck by Cesar. It has so far paid off. Whatever their collective psychology, Brazil have been able to feel a little more secure with Cesar on such form. Manuel Neuer Age: 28 Club: Bayern Munich Currently in the prime of his career, and probably the best goalkeeper in the world right now, Neuer also possesses a disproportionately influential role in a team that have long suggested they themselves are ready to become the best in the world.

Mangan: Debuchy a suitable replacement for Sagna - ESPN FC	France international Mathieu Debuchy has been strongly linked with a move to Arsenal. Bacary Sagna was a popular figure at Arsenal throughout his seven year tenure, and after moving to Manchester City on a free transfer, there's a fear that manager Arsene Wenger will struggle to replace his quality and reliability. It appears that Newcastle United's Mathieu Debuchy is the man chosen to do the job, and a quick comparison of the two players shows similarities in terms of what they produce. Looking at last season's Premier League, we can draw some comparisons. For the record, Sagna played 35 games, Debuchy 29. - Report: Arsenal 'close in on Sanchez, Debuchy' - Report: Liverpool give up hope of signing Sanchez - Report: Debuchy confirms Arsenal talks Their defensive contributions see the Newcastle man come out on top. Debuchy has made 71 tackles to Sagna's 45, has 69 interceptions to Sagna's 51 and wins out on blocks with 12 to seven. A good start. Offensively, they both scored one goal each, Sagna had two assists while Debuchy had three and the chance creation again saw the Newcastle defender come out on top with 23 to 21. So far, so good. However, a quick look at a key stat shows Debuchy's pass completion rate at just 73 percent, while Sagna's was 85 percent. Arsenal are a team that looks to dominate possession, and while perhaps it's illustrative of carelessness in Debuchy's distribution, there may be other factors. At Arsenal he's much more likely to find an outlet with players capable of clever movement, so it's a small concern but definitely something that can be improved. It's also worth noting that Sagna was clearly more cautious, playing 791 backward passes compared to Debuchy's 267. He may have been under instruction to get it forward, or didn't have a centre-half like Per Mertesacker, who was always available to Sagna if he had to turn back. One of Arsenal's tactics over the last couple of seasons -- especially as they've lacked height in midfield -- is to aim the goal kicks towards the right hand side for Sagna to win. His aerial ability at the back, and in open play, has been valuable for Wenger's team. So how do they match up there? Sagna comes out on top, but just barely, with 119 successful aerial duels won to Debuchy's 111. It suggests that the new man's arrival isn't going to create a big issue for Wenger tactically, in regards to figuring out how to replace Sagna's aerial prowess. General discipline is an area to look at, however. Debuchy picked up eight yellow cards and one red card, committing 41 fouls throughout the campaign. Sagna may have been booked a relatively similar number of times (six), but he committed just 23 fouls, so that's something Debuchy would have to work on. While we can compare and contrasts stats, we know that can only tell us so much. Add the opinion of somebody who watched Debuchy week in and week out for Newcastle, and we get a better picture of the player. Ed Harrison, of NUFCblog.com, is sad to see him go, saying, "He was one of [the] best players last season. He's only been at the club 18 months -- and since he gives 100% in every game and has a great temperament -- most of our fans will be sad to see him leave." He highlights a positive attitude going forward but says, "Mathieu goes forward so much that he sometimes gets caught upfield and out of position. When he started out on Tyneside he was also a bit reckless with some of his tackles inside the box and gave away a couple of penalties. "But he improved a lot in the 18 months he was at [the] club, and he's a much better player than when [the club] initially signed him." Overall, it looks like Arsenal are getting a player who, at 28, is very much in the prime of his career, and one whose performances appear to be on an upward curve. Having played in England since January 2013, there's no issue of acclimatisation or adaptation, and he should fit right in at the Emirates. There are clearly one or two things about his game that can be improved. But under the tutelage of Wenger, and with the defensive nous of Steve Bould on the training ground, there's no reason why Debuchy can't be a success for the Gunners. His arrival might be accompanied by that of Chilean forward Alexis Sanchez. Although there's nothing concrete just yet, there's a growing belief that he'll join from Barcelona, and what a signing he would be. If and when it happens, it's something that can be looked at in more detail, but he would pretty much be the perfect capture. He adds pace, strength and goals. He can play wide, off a main striker, or even as the front man and his versatility, as well as his quality, is obviously something that has attracted Wenger. Fingers crossed, but it looks like it could be an excellent start to Arsenal's summer business.	sports

Mooney: Caballero signing benefits Hart, City - ESPN FC	In the future, we might not often see Manchester City's money-splashing ways. Whether through self-sustainability (something the club are definitely working toward) or through UEFA restrictions, the Blues likely won't blow huge sums of cash in summers to come. Not without bringing that money in through sponsorship or player sales or other revenue streams, anyway. While the club has already paid some fees this summer, it's been very much cards-close-to-the-chest and shrewd business. Bacary Sagna was a freebie. Fernando was reported at 12 million pounds. Bruno Zuculini cost something in the region of 1.5 million pounds. On that front, the fee paid on Tuesday for Willy Caballero appears a little against the grain -- 6 million pounds for a backup goalkeeper does seem a bit on the excessive side. - Report: Caballero completes Man City move - Report: Man City may omit a foreign player - Report: Man City deny interest in Sanchez Surely, in a transfer window in which the Blues have a limit on what they can spend thanks to the financial fair play ruling, it would have made much more logical sense to offer last season's backup, Costel Pantilimon, an extra year on his deal. True, the now-departed goalkeeper wasn't a rival to starter Joe Hart, but Pantilimon did have one bonus: He was cheap. He also would have commanded no transfer fee this summer. Then the position could have been filled next summer, when the theory would be that there'd be no restrictions on City's purse again. However, manager Manuel Pellegrini and his team have opted instead to allow the Romanian to leave, and to bring in a not-so-cheap replacement. This tells us a couple of things about both the manager and the club. In December 2013, when Hart was reinstated to the first team following his spell on the bench for a number of calamitous errors, City fans were questioning whether he'd had a long enough "punishment." However, the performances of Pantilimon when he stood in were starting to wane, and the spell made it perfectly obvious to the manager that he was no competition for the Englishman between the sticks. Pantilimon wasn't awful, but he showed he wasn't a long-term option. Pellegrini clearly wants to push Hart. Dropping him last autumn made sure that the goalkeeper rose to the challenge of getting back into the starting XI, and the decision severely cut the number of errors he was making. Come the spring, his saves were helping City win the league. The move for Caballero is meant to push Hart to his limit. The ex-Malaga goalkeeper has been first choice for some time and isn't going to want to spend the season sitting on the bench. If Hart is dropped again in the future, he might not find his path back to the first team as easy as it was last year -- part of the Caballero investment is to benefit one of the players already at the club, that being Hart of course. Think back to the Kevin Keegan era in 2001-03 when the former manager kept Nicky Weaver and Carlo Nash on their toes by swapping them willy-nilly. Caballero is no spring chicken, but he's not old in goalkeeping terms, either. At 32, he's got plenty of good years ahead of him and is more than likely going to be at his peak for the time that he's at City (he signed a three-year deal). He has certainly been one of the best goalkeepers in La Liga over the last three years and, having worked with Pellegrini before, both parties know what they're getting. It's amazing he hasn't been selected for the Argentina side at the World Cup, frankly. New Manchester City goalkeeper Willy Caballero previously played for City boss Manuel Pellegrini at Malaga. It's abundantly clear that the management team were concerned by City's lack of depth last season -- a comment that will be laughed at by outsiders due to the money the Blues have spent in previous seasons. Sadly, for City in years gone by, money spent didn't always equate to a quality-filled playing squad. There were certain key figures for Pellegrini in 2013-14 (Pablo Zabaleta, Yaya Toure, Fernandinho, Sergio Aguero) and when they weren't available, his side struggled. This summer, those responsible for bringing players in have gone some way to addressing that. True, Hart was fit for the whole of the last campaign, but it could have been a completely different first year in England for the Chilean manager if the goalkeeper had suffered a long-term injury or had been suspended for key matches. That potential problem has been solved, since both the first-choice and backup goalkeepers are capable of being the starter. The Englishman will benefit from this signing. A spell without any real competition for the shirt has seen him stagnate; all top athletes relish the rivalry, as it forces them to perform the very best they can. At the moment, the No. 1 shirt remains Hart's to lose -- just because Caballero and Pellegrini have worked together before doesn't automatically spell doom for the England shot-stopper. However, the Argentine has Champions League experience, has racked up more than 100 top-flight appearances in Spain, and will be crucial if City are serious about bettering themselves from last season. Winning four trophies is unlikely, but if anyone is going to do it, they'll be needing strength in depth. And that's exactly what the Blues are building in their squad.	sports

FC Reviews - Six Stickers - ESPN FC	Rating: The 2014 World Cup has been a salmagundi of unpredictability, with late goals aplenty and Costa Rica. In among the surprises, however, have been some constants from tournaments past. From that familiar feeling of disenchantment that grips supporters of England every four years, to the cries of "got, got, need" that accompany quests to complete the official World Cup sticker album. Collecting and collating stickers is a football tradition, nay institution, that transcends generations. For one 29-year-old Portsmouth fan,however, it became somewhat of an obsession. Like many of the best stories -- think "Are You Dave Gorman?" and "Round Ireland With A Fridge" -- Adam Carroll-Smith's "Six Stickers" is based on the premise of a quest that seems pointless to pretty much everyone in the world aside from the author. Philippe Albert: Newcastle United cult hero an dPremier League sticker of the mid-1990s. The tale begins when Carroll-Smith discovers to his horror that the 1996 Premier League sticker album he had always proudly proclaimed to be complete is actually bereft of six little faces.

Mooney: Caballero signing benefits Hart, City - ESPN FC	In the future, we might not often see Manchester City's money-splashing ways. Whether through self-sustainability (something the club are definitely working toward) or through UEFA restrictions, the Blues likely won't blow huge sums of cash in summers to come. Not without bringing that money in through sponsorship or player sales or other revenue streams, anyway. While the club has already paid some fees this summer, it's been very much cards-close-to-the-chest and shrewd business. Bacary Sagna was a freebie. Fernando was reported at 12 million pounds. Bruno Zuculini cost something in the region of 1.5 million pounds. On that front, the fee paid on Tuesday for Willy Caballero appears a little against the grain -- 6 million pounds for a backup goalkeeper does seem a bit on the excessive side. - Report: Caballero completes Man City move - Report: Man City may omit a foreign player - Report: Man City deny interest in Sanchez Surely, in a transfer window in which the Blues have a limit on what they can spend thanks to the financial fair play ruling, it would have made much more logical sense to offer last season's backup, Costel Pantilimon, an extra year on his deal. True, the now-departed goalkeeper wasn't a rival to starter Joe Hart, but Pantilimon did have one bonus: He was cheap. He also would have commanded no transfer fee this summer. Then the position could have been filled next summer, when the theory would be that there'd be no restrictions on City's purse again. However, manager Manuel Pellegrini and his team have opted instead to allow the Romanian to leave, and to bring in a not-so-cheap replacement. This tells us a couple of things about both the manager and the club. In December 2013, when Hart was reinstated to the first team following his spell on the bench for a number of calamitous errors, City fans were questioning whether he'd had a long enough "punishment." However, the performances of Pantilimon when he stood in were starting to wane, and the spell made it perfectly obvious to the manager that he was no competition for the Englishman between the sticks. Pantilimon wasn't awful, but he showed he wasn't a long-term option. Pellegrini clearly wants to push Hart. Dropping him last autumn made sure that the goalkeeper rose to the challenge of getting back into the starting XI, and the decision severely cut the number of errors he was making. Come the spring, his saves were helping City win the league. The move for Caballero is meant to push Hart to his limit. The ex-Malaga goalkeeper has been first choice for some time and isn't going to want to spend the season sitting on the bench. If Hart is dropped again in the future, he might not find his path back to the first team as easy as it was last year -- part of the Caballero investment is to benefit one of the players already at the club, that being Hart of course. Think back to the Kevin Keegan era in 2001-03 when the former manager kept Nicky Weaver and Carlo Nash on their toes by swapping them willy-nilly. Caballero is no spring chicken, but he's not old in goalkeeping terms, either. At 32, he's got plenty of good years ahead of him and is more than likely going to be at his peak for the time that he's at City (he signed a three-year deal). He has certainly been one of the best goalkeepers in La Liga over the last three years and, having worked with Pellegrini before, both parties know what they're getting. It's amazing he hasn't been selected for the Argentina side at the World Cup, frankly. New Manchester City goalkeeper Willy Caballero previously played for City boss Manuel Pellegrini at Malaga. It's abundantly clear that the management team were concerned by City's lack of depth last season -- a comment that will be laughed at by outsiders due to the money the Blues have spent in previous seasons. Sadly, for City in years gone by, money spent didn't always equate to a quality-filled playing squad. There were certain key figures for Pellegrini in 2013-14 (Pablo Zabaleta, Yaya Toure, Fernandinho, Sergio Aguero) and when they weren't available, his side struggled. This summer, those responsible for bringing players in have gone some way to addressing that. True, Hart was fit for the whole of the last campaign, but it could have been a completely different first year in England for the Chilean manager if the goalkeeper had suffered a long-term injury or had been suspended for key matches. That potential problem has been solved, since both the first-choice and backup goalkeepers are capable of being the starter. The Englishman will benefit from this signing. A spell without any real competition for the shirt has seen him stagnate; all top athletes relish the rivalry, as it forces them to perform the very best they can. At the moment, the No. 1 shirt remains Hart's to lose -- just because Caballero and Pellegrini have worked together before doesn't automatically spell doom for the England shot-stopper. However, the Argentine has Champions League experience, has racked up more than 100 top-flight appearances in Spain, and will be crucial if City are serious about bettering themselves from last season. Winning four trophies is unlikely, but if anyone is going to do it, they'll be needing strength in depth. And that's exactly what the Blues are building in their squad.	sports

Barcelona sign Claudio Bravo - ESPN FC	Barcelona confirmed the signing of Claudio Bravo on Monday. He will battle Marc-Andre ter Stegen for the No. 1 shirt. Goalkeepers have really come to the fore at this World Cup and on Monday, Barcelona presented one of the many players in that position to shine in Brazil: Chile international Claudio Bravo. The 12 million-euro signing of a player who has impressed in La Liga over eight seasons with Real Sociedad comes after Marc-Andre ter Stegen's arrival following the departure of Victor Valdes. - Video: Goalkeepers prove their worth at World Cup - Corrigan: Bravo excited by Barca switch The 22-year-old from Borussia Monchengladbach, who signed in May for a fee similar to Bravo's, was previously thought to be Barca's No. 1 for the near future. It was an open secret he would sign when it became clear that Valdes would not agree a new contract, but now the goalkeeping strategy has become clearer with the signing of Bravo. And it is not dissimilar to the one that worked so well for Real Madrid last season: why have one top-class man to choose from when you can have two? Iker Casillas and Diego Lopez pushed each other on a daily basis at Real since Jose Mourinho decided he wanted to make life less comfortable for Casillas as the side's first choice, and it looks like Bravo and ter Stegen have been brought in to play a similar role next season at the Camp Nou. With the top teams needing to compete at the highest level in all competitions there are enough games in a season to keep two goalkeepers satisfied. The expectation is that the Champions League every season will see the top teams competing in at least 14 games if they reach a semifinal. Barca will also have added Spanish Cup games starting before the Christmas break. Last term, they played in nine games in that competition on their way to losing the final to that wonder goal from Gareth Bale. In Madrid, Carlo Ancelotti made the controversial decision early on to relegate crowd favourite Casillas to the cups while Lopez played in La Liga. The Italian never wavered once from that plan. The main reason for that was both keepers were able to stay sharp enough to continue producing top-class performances throughout the season. If either had wobbled to a worrying degree he would have been quickly replaced by his rival. Barcelona beat competition from a host of clubs to sign ter Stegen. And that appears to be the thinking behind Barca's plan. The Monchengladbach-born player's youth naturally places a question mark over his ability to leave his home town and adapt quickly to La Liga. Meanwhile, his 31-year-old Chilean rival has been handed a four-year contract. Bravo himself said on Monday: "Barca have not told me that I am coming as a reserve keeper; ter Stegen is obviously a quality keeper, otherwise he would not be at Barca. But I will feel very comfortable with the system. When I arrived at Real Sociedad I was unknown, now the same is happening here." Bravo is perhaps underplaying his own ability with that final remark. He will feel -- as the more experienced of the two new arrivals -- favourite to start the season in the starting XI. The club's sporting director, Andoni Zubizarreta, attempted to clarify the situation, and said: "Ter Stegen knew from the very beginning that another keeper of Bravo's level would be coming. All players that come to the club know they come to compete with the best; it is a characteristic of this club." Barca were disrupted last term by the season-ending injury to Valdes, and while Jose Manuel Pinto was not directly to blame for any of the failures that were to follow, they must have been looking jealously at their big rival in the Bernabeu who had two world-class keepers to choose from. Now it looks like they have followed the lead taken by their rivals, leaving nothing to chance next season.	sports

Cesare Prandelli the star man at Galatasaray - ESPN FC	Galatasaray president Unal Aysal is perhaps Turkey's most high profile frequenter of the managerial merry-go-round. For the second time in a row, it has thrown up an Italian, and for the third, a former Fiorentina boss, as Cesare Prandelli fills Roberto Mancini's recently vacated seat. The original favourite had been Shakhtar's dynasty-builder Mircea Lucescu, with the Turkish rumour mill reporting his arrival in Istanbul at various times this summer. Curiously for Manchester United fans, the news then broke that Galatasaray were holding talks with David Moyes, as the obligatory pictures of the Scot arriving at Istanbul Ataturk airport surfaced. Yet Galatasaray's overlords have now settled on Cesare Prandelli, reacting swiftly to events at the 2014 World Cup after Italy's failure to reach the knockout stages and Prandelli's subsequent resignation. The mission for Prandelli, with "aim" not seeming a strong enough term, is simple. The 56-year-old must ensure that Galatasaray reach their 20th league title before cross-continental rivals Fenerbahce. Both clubs are currently star-gazing, with Turkish sides being awarded a star above their crest for every five league titles. They each have three stars and stand on 19 titles, which Fener drawing level after their triumphant 2013-14 campaign. Indeed, at the news conference for his unveiling Prandelli accepted the mission. "Our goal is very clear," he said. "To get the fourth star and to be successful in the Champions League." The narrative for the coming season is already set, both teams shooting for the star. Mancini, though, failed in the two most important tasks that any Galatasaray manager faces. The first being the raison d'etre of the club, the entire foundation on which its history and prestige has been built, winning the Turkish League. The 49-year-old also did little to adhere himself to the masses of Galatasaray fans throughout the country, always giving the impression that his tenure was a temporary one, a sort of filler before moving on to something new. Man City fans famously spent £7,000 to place a "thank you" message in La Gazzetta dello Sport after Mancini was sacked at Eastlands. It is unlikely he will get the same from Gala fans. Despite such shortcomings, Mancini's tenure was a qualified success. An encapsulating, snow-ridden 1-0 win over Juventus in Istanbul meant Mancini succeeded in taking Galatasaray to the knockout stages of the Champions League. That said, an eventual round-of-16 defeat to Chelsea, with the questionable use of a 4-2-4 formation in the home leg, raised eyebrows once again. The Italian also brought more silverware to the Turk Telekom Arena, as a Wesley Sneijder goal saw off Eskisehirspor in the Turkish Cup final. Yet without the league, other successes fade become irrelevant. Cesare Prandelli signs his contract alongside Galatasaray president Unal Aysal. Prandelli will have been briefed on these requirements during the negotiation stage. His first task will need to be an appeal to the fans, ensuring that the famous "Welcome to Hell" is directed at the opposition and not at the club's new manager. To do that an air of permanence must be cultivated, contrasting with the stop-gap nature of Mancini. "I met the president and I heard that he wants to achieve certain results and maybe this is what I need," said Prandelli as he accepted the lofty requirements of a Galatasaray boss. "I want to challenge, I think I have made the right decision because the aim is to win." On the field, Galatasaray need co-ordination to tighten a loose defence. Mancini went some way to creating a solid unit, but individual errors and lapses in concentration too often hampered the previous campaign. At the top of the pitch, with Drogba now gone, Burak Yilmaz will again become the main focal point in front of Wesley Sneijder, though a necessary reliance on Turkish-born players is enforced through the league's strict foreigner quotas. Semih Kaya, Selcuk Inan and the aforementioned Yilmaz are likely to form a permanent spine in Prandelli's Galatasaray. Learning Turkish will aid Prandelli's transition to this large and complex nation, and having never worked outside of Italy and the Italian language will prove another challenge. Mancini, strangely, conducted his news conferences in English, translated into Turkish. The input of the Italian's non-standard English left an output of non-standard Turkish, baffling a few journalists. Indeed, if a question was put to Mancini in English, the arduous process of announcing a translation of the question before the answer added to the tedium. Due to the perceived ease of communication, it is now customary that any manager working in a foreign land will be linked with players from his home nation. The Italian has been pestered about the possible signing of Mario Balotelli from Milan, but insisted that he "cannot talk about it," though he did refer to Juventus' Andrea Pirlo as the hallmark of a Prandelli player. "I love football players who want to win like Pirlo," he said. But Galatasaray President Unal Aysal has looked to quash any prospective rumours by briefing the Turkish media that only one or two major signings will be made this summer, leaving Prandelli with little scope to effect major change in the playing staff. Indeed, 12 permanent deals were concluded over the course of the 2013-14 season as the club failed to counter-act a resurgent Fenerbahce. Despite the pressure that weighs heavy on both sides of the Bosporus, Prandelli takes over at an opportune moment, admitting that the club's "history is huge," though insisting the focus is on "upcoming projects rather than the past." Mancini inherited the toxic atmosphere of Terim's departure, still resented by some fans, and a points deficit in the race with Fenerbahce. Prandelli arrives with few missing Mancini and the league slate wiped clean for 2014-15. The manager and squad can either see the quest for that fourth star as a burden or an opportunity. The burden of being the manager who failed to stop Fenerbahce reaching the milestone first is counteracted by the opportunity to be the one who made history.	sports

A haunting defeat for Brazil - ESPN FC	BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil -- You have got to hand it to the Brazilian players. A few minutes after suffering the worst drubbing in the history of their national team, they did not resort to evasive tactics when it was time to explain what had just happened on the Estadio Mineirao pitch. The problem was none of them seemed to know the answer to the question. One by one, they negotiated the maze called the mixed zone with looks that gave away a feeling many people watching the semifinal against Germany had been able to preempt: This generation of Selecao stars will be forever marked by Tuesday's events in Belo Horizonte. Dani Alves, dropped from the team after the Chile game in the round of 16, led the saddest of parades. "We have lost the game, and that hurts more than anything else," the Barcelona full-back said. "We are out of the final, and that would have been difficult to handle even if we had lost 1-0." There was nowhere to hide from a score that kept flashing on the many monitors spread around the maze. Brazil 1-7 Germany -- reaction - Marcotti: Scolari at a loss to explain - Jones: Seven stages of grief for Brazil - Duarte: Haunting defeat for the Selecao - Delaney: Three Points - Brazil broken by Germany - Low: German plan worked perfectly - Behind the Numbers: Germany's historic win - Photo Gallery: Best of Brazil vs. Germany - Klose breaks World Cup goals record | Highlight - Social reaction: Brazil, did that just happen? Seven goals to one. It is a result that will mark a generation of footballers, supporters and -- why not -- journalists. The fact that Brazil still have a chance to save some face in Saturday's playoff for third place in Brasilia seemed much less a consolation prize than a nuisance for athletes who had just been humiliated on the biggest stage of their careers, in front of their own fans. "We have to take it like men and try to bounce back," Willian said, with his gaze focusing on everything other than his interlocutor's eyes. "We are all family bread-winners and people with feelings. We know this defeat might haunt us for the rest of our lives." Still, Brazil will have to take the field once more, and avoiding another debacle has become a matter of urgency for Luiz Felipe Scolari, who could not have looked more deflated. Gone was his dream of emulating Italy's Vittorio Pozzo as the only manager to win two World Cups, and in the same stride, he might have kissed goodbye to aspirations of a triumphant return to European football to resume a project abruptly aborted when he was dismissed by Chelsea in 2009. As expected, Big Phil attempted to shoulder the blame. "Who is responsible for team selection and tactical choices? I am," he said. "So I am the person who will be remembered for the worst defeat, but we took a risk, and now we have to assimilate and keep living." Scolari, it should be noted, put on the pitch a first XI that had never trained together. Even victory in Saturday's third-place match will do little to shake the memories of Brazil's Belo Horizonte humiliation. Saturday's game will actually be the start of the Selecao's long walk of shame toward the 2018 World Cup. For a start, it will probably be the last time we will see a good number of players in a Brazil shirt. Julio Cesar, who turns 35 in September, all but ruled himself out of future caps -- "maybe the next World Cup is beyond my reach" -- when trying to talk about the future of the team. The defeat was particularly hard on the goalkeeper, not only because of the number of balls in the back of his net but also due to the feeling that his teammates have a lot of work to do to shake off this Mineirazo. "I wish we had lost 1-0, and I had made mistake," he said. "It's very hard what happened today. They simply scored four goals in six minutes, and all of a sudden we were all over the place. We lost our focus, and that was fatal against a team like Germany. These guys have been playing together for six years and contested a series of European Championships and World Cup semifinals. They are experienced and pounced on our mistakes." Oscar, who was propped up by Scolari on the pitch and seemingly admonished by the manager for weeping, was the image of somebody dreading to think about the next few months or years. "I am gutted, it was impossible not to feel like crying after a game like this," the scorer of Brazil's goal said. In an attempt to pick up the pieces, David Luiz, whose first official game as Brazil captain ended with the horrendous sound of home fans booing the Selecao after applauding the Germans' seventh goal, called for calm. "Life is not over," he said. "It's perhaps the hardest moments in our lives, but we need to be mature and own up to our mistakes. We have a chance to leave this World Cup with our heads up". It will be much easier said than done. The drubbing in Belo Horizonte has, ironically, finally turned the Maracanazo, Brazil's famous defeat to Uruguay in the final match of the 1950 World Cup, into a thing of the ancient past. Haunting the Selecao now -- and for the foreseeable future -- is a night in which they were humbled, outclassed and made to look ordinary. It is impossible not to think they are main witnesses to the moment Brazilian football as we know it died a horrible and painful death at the hands of Germany. Bouncing back from that will take a lot more than words and promises.

A haunting defeat for Brazil - ESPN FC	BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil -- You have got to hand it to the Brazilian players. A few minutes after suffering the worst drubbing in the history of their national team, they did not resort to evasive tactics when it was time to explain what had just happened on the Estadio Mineirao pitch. The problem was none of them seemed to know the answer to the question. One by one, they negotiated the maze called the mixed zone with looks that gave away a feeling many people watching the semifinal against Germany had been able to preempt: This generation of Selecao stars will be forever marked by Tuesday's events in Belo Horizonte.

Alejandro Sabella hails Lionel Messi has best player in the world - ESPN FC	SAO PAULO -- Normally a reserved man who avoids hype, Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella isn't shy about declaring Lionel Messi to be the best player in the world. Comparing the Argentina captain with Arjen Robben of the Netherlands and Brazil's Neymar, Sabella on Tuesday held up Messi as the undisputed No. 1. "Robben is a great player. He is very important for Holland. Like Neymar is for Brazil and Messi for Argentina," Sabella said. "Each of them is important for their teams, but Messi is the best of them all." After a disappointing World Cup four years ago, Messi has carried Argentina into the semifinals in Brazil, scoring four goals -- the same tally Neymar reached before injury ruled him out of the tournament. Robben, who faces Argentina in the second semifinal on Wednesday, has scored three. Though he's been named world player of the year for times for his accomplishments with Barcelona, Messi hasn't had the same kind of success with Argentina, who haven't won a major title since the 1993 Copa America. Lionel Messi is more important to Argentina than any other player is to any other team, says Alejandro Sabella. This is the first time since 1990 that Argentina have reached a World Cup semifinal, which Sabella said was a victory in itself. "After 24 years Argentina is among the four best teams in the world," Sabella said. "I think this group of players has already won. Let's see if we can win even more." If they do win the semifinal, Argentina won't have to worry about rivals Brazil in the title game. Sabella was just as stunned as everyone else to see Brazil lose 7-1 to Germany in the first semifinal, a game Argentina's players watched the end of on TV at Itaquerao Stadium, even delaying their training session for around 20 minutes. Sabella said the heavy defeat for Brazil was clearly "not normal." "But in football you have to expect these things," Sabella said. "It's football. It's the most illogical of sports. Things happen that you cannot foresee."	sports
