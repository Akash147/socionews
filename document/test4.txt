KATHMANDU FEB 14 - Madhyapur Thimi put off the challenge of Mechinagar beating them 1-0 to enter the final of the Late King Birendra Memorial Inter-Municipality Running Shield Football Tournament Friday at Dashrath Stadium. Thimi?s Santosh Sahukhala scored the only goal of the match in the 82nd minute to set up title showdown with Biratnagar on Sunday. Mechinagar will fight it out with Pokhara in the third place play-off on Saturday. Mechinagar had the lion?s share of the possession in the first half but couldn?t capitalize on it and succumbed to the onslaught of Thimi in the second half. ?We played fast game to unsettle them and they found our boys too hot to handle in the second half? said Upendra Man Singh captain coach and goalkeeper of Thimi hinting to apparent tiredness of the eastern team. ?We are glad to be in the final and have nothing to lose so we will play attacking game against Biratnagar in the final? Singh added. Singh also thanked the Thimi public who flocked in large numbers to support the team. ?I want to thank our supporters. Their support really helped us? ?We couldn?t convert our chances while they converted one? Mechinagar coach Bhagirath Ale told Kantipur Online. ?We don?t get too many chances in a competitive game and should have converted the chances we got? he added. Thimi cheered on by the partisan crowd started the match on a positive frame and came close to opening the scoring in the 10th minute. Santosh Sahukhala?s shot taken from the left side of the box was thrown out via the upper bar by Mechinagar goalie Min Bahadur Basnet. Thereafter the Jhapa outfit took control of the game and created some openings. Bikash Subba ran down the right flank and made a lovely cross-leaving Singh stranded on first bar but Bijay Subba couldn?t reach to tap it home in the 22nd minute. Binod Gurung also wasted a chance guiding a clear header feebly in to Singh?s hand in the 29th minute. Bikash Subba missed the easiest of the chances for Mechinagar in the 33rd minute. Prabesh Katuwal cleverly chipped a freekick from about 25 yards to find Subba inside the box but Subba failed to score from six yards. Yugal Kishore Rai also hit a brilliant shot from the right side of the box in the 42nd minute but Singh again came to Thimi?s rescue with an acrobatic save to ensure clean sheet going into the half-time break. Thimi came back strong after the break and controlled the match. Yugal Kishore Rai had to be substituted with injury in the 54th minute to compound Mechinagar?s misery. Santosh Basnet saved Mechinagar from a certain goal in the 56th minute. Pradeep Dangol?s header off a cross from right flank found Ramesh Sinkaman in front of the goal but Basnet blocked Sinkaman?s shot taken from point-blank range. Sahukhala finally scored the goal in the dying minutes of the second half. Pradeep the leading scorer in the tournament with nine goals hit a powerful shot from about 30 yards that wasn?t cleanly gathered by goalie Basnet and Ramesh Sinkaman collected the rebound and passed it to Sahukhala who fired it into the left corner of the net. Mechinagar poured forward desperately seeking an equaliser but couldn?t find one in the remaining time. Tika Ram Karki and Deepak Tamang of Mechinagar were cautioned by referee Buddhi Gurung for unfair play. (snn)Posted on: 2004-02-15 02:44 AddThis Button BEGIN
