Chile midfielder Arturo Vidal says his side are not interested in eliminating Spain from the FIFA World Cupâ„¢ - they just want to win the whole thing.

The South Americans know that any result against the reigning world champions on Wednesday at Rio's Maracana would possibly be enough to send La Roja out of the competition.

But Vidal says the kudos that knocking out the champions would bring is irrelevant to ambitious players who genuinely believe they can conquer the world.

"We hope to play well against Spain, take the three points, and if we knock them out that would be great. But we didn't come here to knock out Spain, we came here to win the World Cup," he said.

However, the Juventus star expects there to be a reaction from Spain following their incredible 5-1 defeat by the Netherlands on the second day of the tournament.

    We have our style and we'll keep to it, we'll keep working in the same way and we're not going to change that.

"As world champions, Spain have quality," said the 27-year-old. "They have great players who will go onto the field full of rage."

Although Chile, who beat Australia 3-1 in their opening Group B match, may be underdogs against the holders and know a point would be a great result for them, Vidal insisted they will not be sitting back and trying to defend.

"We're going to push forward looking for the three points," he said. "We have our style and we'll keep to it, we'll keep working in the same way and we're not going to change that."

Vidal was substituted during their first game against Australia and has been recovering from a knee operation just over a month ago on a meniscus problem, but says he is now fully fit.

"The knee is responding very well, I'm in very good condition and I hope to start," he said. "I'm good, 100 per cent physically and I'm not thinking about my knee.
