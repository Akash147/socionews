KATHMANDU FEB 11 - One team had national stalwarts in the likes of Rakesh Shrestha Anil Adhikari Nabin Neupane Balgopal Maharjan Kumar Thapa Rajesh Shahi Hari Khadka Sagar Thapa and Rajan Rayamajhi. The other had no one except skipper Narottam Gautam of that stature in the ranks. Kathmandu whose teamlist read as the who?s who of Nepali football were thoroughly outplayed and rightly beaten 4-3 by Mechinagar in tie-breaker in their quarterfinal match of the Late King Birendra Memorial Inter-Municipality Running Shield Football Tournament Tuesday at Dashrath Stadium. Both the teams had failed to break ice in the regulation as well as 30 minutes of added extra time. Min Bahadur Basnet the Mechinagar goalie was the unlikely hero of the match saving three of the seven shots taken by Kathmandu. Kumar Thapa Lokabandhu Gurung and Rakesh Shrestha?s shot was saved by the keeper while Anil hit wide. Tashi Hari and keeper Binod Dangol who took the sixth shot under pressure converted their spotkicks. For the Jhapa outfit Prawesh Katuwal Bijay Subba Purna Subba and Bikash Subba converted their shots while Prem Subba hit out. Dangol who carried Kathmandu on his broad shoulders into the extra-time and tiebreaker saved the shots by Dipak Tamang and Yugal Kishor Rai. Kathmandu with the stars in their ranks was outplayed by the outsiders in the entire regulation time and was competitive only during 30 minutes of the added extra-time. Hari Khadka the pride of Jhapa expected to lead the Mechinagar team to glory played his part in the victory albeit in a way he wouldn?t like. He snubbed his district and decided to play for Kathmandu thereby inspiring the juniors of his district to subdue Hari. B Ale the coach of Mechinagar praised his players including the Mahavir Club goalie after the win. ?Hari defected thinking our team to be weak and the hurt juniors played for pride? he added in the same lines of manager Baljit Rai. The distraught Kathmandu camp were lost for words and Raju Shakya team coach refused to comment on the dismal performance. Mechinagar dominated the match from the outset and outplayed Kathmandu in the way Kathmandu was expected to dominate. Without the brilliance of keeper Dangol Kathmandu would have lost the match by a humiliating margin. In the 17th minute Bijaya Subba unleashed a powerful shot from about 40 yards that tested the skills of Dangol. Binod Gurung failed to direct a clear header off a Bikash Subba cross in the 41st minute. Kathmandu replaced unfit Navin Neupane with Ganesh Lawati in the 13th minute while Kailash Dangol came in for Rajesh Shahi after the first half but couldn?t alter the course of match. In fact such was the strength of the team that player of the caliber of Sagar Thapa was left in bench for the entire match. Kathmandu goalie Dangol charged out of his box and handled the ball when Bikash Subba made a brilliant run from the centre in the 48th minute. Referee Sriram Ranjitkar surprisingly produced only yellow card for this offence. Kathmandu made their first attempt on goal in the 55th minute when Tashi fired a thunderous shot from D-line that was saved by Mechinagar goalie Basnet. Binod Gurung charged from the right flank and hit a great shot from a difficult angle inviting another great save from Dangol in the 77th minute. Such was the dominance of the visitors that they created many chances in the second half while the hosts came close only in two other occasions. In the injury time of second half Hari fed Upreti in the right side of the box and Upreti chipped beautifully to force a brilliant save from goalie Basnet. Kathmandu had the closest look in the 27th minute of added time. Lokbandhu crossed to Tashi from the right and Tashi connected powerful header that hit the inside of the bar and passed tantalisingly past the second bar. Bikash Subba also came close in the 10th minute of the extra time when he collected Binod Gurung?s pass in the box and shot at the goal that was saved again by Dangol.
