KATHMANDU FEB 06 - Mahendra Police Club star Ananta Thapa made merry as Biratnagar romped into the semifinals of the first Late King Birendra Memorial Inter-Municipality Running Shield Football Tournament demolishing Tikapur 8-1 Wednesday at Dashrath Stadium. Biratnagar will now play the winner of the Thursday’s match between Dharan and Pokhara in the semifinal. Tikapur with no big stars to their name played valiantly to hold the star-studded Biratnagar for 1-1 in the first half but the floodgates opened in the second half as Tikapur players looked jaded. Thapa who had scored one in the first half added four in the second to lead the stake for the top scoring honors in the tournament that carries a handsome award of Rs 50000. Thapa however could have added some more goals with better finishing and could have emerged the sole contender for the award. He missed at least six easy chances but seemed to be unhappy every time his mates failed to find him in the box as he made his intentions clear for the award. Biratnagar dominated the match right from the outset but failed to score as all the frontline players looked intent to top score in the match. Dev Narayan Chaudhary who had a goal in the previous match missed a couple of clear chances in the opening minutes looking to swell his goal tally. He also looked furious when the midfielders didn’t supply the balls to his liking. He resigned to fate only after Thapa completed the hat trick in the second half. Thapa opened the scoring for Biratnagar in the 36th minute of the match when he dribbled past Devraj Sahu and buried the ball in the net. But Tikapur showed tenacity and vigor to pull one back eight minutes later. Santosh Gurung made a run on the right flank and hit a shot that couldn’t be cleanly gathered by Biratnagar goalie Surendra Shrestha. Dhurva Karki was alert for the rebound and dabbed in the easy ball to go into the halftime break with plenty of hope. But Biratnagar soured their ambitions and dominated the match thereafter. Thapa scored in 54th 60th 66th and 82nd minute of the match while Sunil Magar helped himself with a brace in 68th and 79th minute. Parbat Pandey was the reluctant scorer in the 69th minute as his free kick taken from about 30 yards searching Thapa somehow evaded Thapa and got into the net. He showed the funny side of his persona by immediately going to Thapa to apparently seek pardon. The result was a foregone conclusion after a couple of goals and the only interest left was whether Thapa could help himself to some more goals. Thapa wanted the ball from every position and his mates more or less complied but he faltered in finishing. He may look at it differently but he will have only himself to blame if any other striker eventually tops the goal scoring chart. (snn)Posted on: 2004-02-06 03:30 AddThis Button BEGIN
